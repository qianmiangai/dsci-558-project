Joan Miro,"The mind is a fascinating thing, and there’s no saying how deep it may truly be, or how high it may soar. We may be confined to our daily thoughts that may be as impressive, but in our dreams, we see how far it can really take us. The man titled to be one of the first representatives of putting this realm to the canvas is Joan Miró, a Spanish artist that practiced surrealism in its earliest days. In order to allow himself to explore other ways of artistic creation, he chose not to affiliate himself with surrealists of the time and had explored expressionism, lyrical abstraction, and other styles. Regardless, there’s a slight thread of the dream-like in most of his portrayals, whether from his subconsciousness or imagination, one that would allure the masses as much as it did other great artists.  Joan Miró i Ferrà was born in Barcelona, Catalonia. His father, Miquel Miró i Adzerias, a silversmith and watchmaker and his mother, Dolors Ferrà i Oromí, the daughter of a cabinet maker from Palma de Mallorca, have brought him up at Barri Gòtic, the center of the old city of Barcelona. When he was 7 years old, Miró began attending drawing classes at a private school in a medieval mansion at Carrer del Regomir. At the age of 14, Miró enrolled in business school in Barcelona but also attended La Llotja - Escuela Superior de Artes Industriales y Bellas Artes, to the dismay of his father, where he was taught by Modest Urgell and Josep Pascó. Miró took a position as a clerk in a drugstore after completing three years of art studies, as his parents wished. But he was overworked there and became seriously ill, verging on a nervous breakdown, followed by a bout of typhoid fever. Miró’s poor health caused his parents to allow him to resume his art studies, attending from 1912 to 1915 Francesc Galí’s Escola d’Art in Barcelona, a free-spirited school famous for its influence of contemporary foreign painters and also interest in literature and music. There, Miró learned to draw by the sense of touch alone, rather than by sight.   In 1913, he joined the “Cercle Artistic de Sant Lluc” for drawing classes and for the opportunity of showing his work along with other members. Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc was an arts society founded in 1893 by Joan Llimona, Josep Llimona, Antoni Utrillo, Alexandre de Riquer, as a reaction to the anticlerical current in modernism. CAdSL was known for its vigorous defense of Catholic morals and family virtue. These ideals manifested in the form of prohibiting artistic nude and all the members pursued humble qualities that were distinctive of the mediaeval guilds. Miró and a few fellow artists from the group soon established a new group within Saint Lluc. They called themselves the Courbet group, after a painter whom they admired for his radicalism.  Around 1915, the Dada movement was emerging and Miró began reading the avant-garde Surrealist poets such as Apollinaire and Pierre Reverdy. His days inn Barcelona had also been influenced as he frequently visited the Galeries Dalmau, which was the hub of avant-garde art that exhibited the work of many foreign artists. He received an encouragement from the gallery owner and art dealer José Dalmau, who helped him organize his first solo show at his gallery in Barcelona. His first exhibition did not go so well as his other exhibitions during his fruitful career would - his work was harshly ridiculed and defaced. His early art, at that time, was pretty much influenced by Fauves and Cubists that exhibited in Barcelona in 1917, and he was greatly inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. He used a variety of bright colors which were common in Fauvism, and added many shapes, which was common in the Cubism art form.   Another source of inspiration for this artist is the rich folklore of his beloved Catalonia, which will influence his art from the beginning to its end. Miró was also forever fascinated with the interiors of ninth to twelfth century frescoed churches, with their relatively crude execution and their simple, flat and cartoon-like imagery. The use of primary colors heavily outlined in black, with a darkly shaded surrounding field, and the treatment of space as flat surfaces are just some of the elements that lingered on in his artworks. Much like children depict larger elements based on their importance to them, so did Miró play with disproportions of scale, making certain objects far larger than the others.   In 1919, Miró took his first trip to Paris, visiting Picasso in his studio. From that moment, he divided his time between Paris and his parents’ summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp in Spain. The Farm was painted in that period and it is showing a transition to a more individual style of painting together with certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who had bought The Farm, compared the artistic accomplishment to James Joyce’s Ulysses: “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that you feel when you are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.” In Paris, Miró became friends with Max Jacob, Pierre Reverdy, and Tristan Tzara. He was now a part of the Dada circle, participating in their activities.  He read works of Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, the German Romantic poets and the Pre-Socratic philosophers, as well as the poets rehabilitated by the Surrealist group such as Jarry, Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Lautréamont, and Rimbaud. In 1921, Dalmau had once again organized Miró’s first solo show, this time in Paris, at the Galerie la Licorne.   In 1923, there was a big change in Miró's art, moving toward more sign-like forms where flat shapes and lines, mostly black or strongly colored, suggest the subjects, sometimes quite cryptically. Typical representational painting of this phase is Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) from 1923 where a triangle is used for the head, curved lines for the mustache, and angular lines for the body. This pictorial sign language will be a central theme throughout the rest of his career, and the overall composition would later be used by Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Arshile Gorky and other artists of the modernist period.   In 1925, Miró had definitely abandoned figurative art as he entered the Surrealist world with an exhibition at the Galerie Pierre, a major Surrealist event. The great Breton said that Miró's work had an innocence and freedom about it. After that, he was included in the first Surrealist exhibition at the Galerie Pierre that same year. In 1928, Miró had visited Netherlands and began a series of paintings inspired by Dutch masters. At this point he had stated his intention to “assassinate painting” as a form of disliking bourgeois art and began working with less conventional means of expression such as collage and assemblage. The same year, he had created his first papiers collés (pasted papers). In 1932, Miró returned to Barcelona and continued to paint in a new manner, producing art that was visually more direct and aggressive. He experimented with various materials including wood, metal, hardboard, objects, and paper of all kinds. In the early 1930s, Miró was concentrated on making Surrealist sculptures with painted stones and found objects.   During the Civil War in Spain, Miró lived in France. Under a deep distress and under the influence of the tragedy unfolding in Spain, he had returned to a certain version of realism. In Paris, in 1937, he painted the mural for the Spanish Republic’s pavilion at the World’s Fair titled The Reaper (Catalan peasant in revolt), which later disappeared. He returned to Spain four years later, only to move again to Varengeville-sur-Mer on the Normandy coast where he stayed until the Nazis started bombing the area. Even though Miró was not a politically active artist, his forms during this hard time are depicting a certain brutality with distortions and garish color. During World War II, he was inspired and influenced by the night, music, and stars and was working on establishing the language for his series titled Constellations. These paintings consisted of black dots representing stars on a white ground using gouache and thinned oil on paper tending toward cosmic awareness - painted poetry. In 1941, while Europe was still at war, the Museum of Modern Art in New York held the first retrospective exhibition of his work.   From 1944, Miró started to experiment with ceramics, bronze sculpture, and printmaking. He was always influenced by his Catalan heritage, especially the decorated Catalan pottery. With Josep Llorens y Artigas, his lifelong friend and artistic partner, he collaborated in pottery projects in the years to come. His Wall of the Moon and Wall of the Sun for the UNESCO building in Paris were given a Guggenheim International Award. Miró’s increasingly large ceramic forms have been created in individual parts to be reconnected after firing. His idea behind these gigantic works is a deference of the ceramic medium itself - what he wanted to make clear is that ceramics is not just another medium to transform painting, it is an art dimension for itself.  Around the same time, Miró started to concentrate on prints and from 1954 to 1958 he worked almost exclusively in these two mediums.  Miró worked in several printmaking processes, including engraving, lithography and etching, as well as the use of stencils (called pochoir). In 1954, he received the Grand Prize for Graphic Work at the Venice Biennale, and in 1955, his work was included in the first documenta exhibition in Kassel. Joan Miró was among the first artists to develop automatic drawing, invented (or re-invented) by the surrealists, as a means of expressing the subconscious.  He used it as a way to undo the previously established techniques in painting. Most of his paintings often started out as automatic drawings.  In the 1950s, Miró’s work on monumental and public commissions increased. He was influenced by young American painters, so he started to create large-format paintings in his studio that Josep Lluís Sert had designed for him in Palma, Majorca and where he has lived from 1956. After his visit to Japan, a fascination by the techniques used by Japanese calligraphers can clearly be seen in his work which gradually strived towards a simplification and paring down of forms and colors. At the end of Franco regime in Spain, Miró awakens the political activist within as he uses all available means of expression to demonstrate his criticism of the general situation (both cultural and political) in his beloved homeland, and Catalonia especially.   Miró had created over 250 illustrated books known as Livres d' Artiste, works of art that utilize the form of the book published in small editions. The Fundació Joan Miró, a museum dedicated to his work was established in his native city of Barcelona in 1975, and another, the Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró, was established in his adoptive city of Palma de Mallorca in 1981. It was thanks to Pilar Juncosa, Miró’s wife who shared his enthusiasm, that the Joan Miró Foundation was set up and she donated or loaned to it a large part of her personal collection of her husband’s work.  After a century-long life that has seen two world wars, Joan Miró died in 1983 with numerous monumental accomplishments to his name. An extensive, timeless oeuvre being one of them, he strongly believed that art had taken a wrong turn somewhere along the line and that it should be more like making love - a total sensation, reckless and defenseless. With his sophisticated work engaging both the physical senses and the psyche, he’s definitely managed to provoke an impression and embrace the viewer, be it an amateur or a professional colleague. Drawing from his own unconsciousness, we may all find a shade of our own thoughts in his brilliant works. ",1

Kyriakos Kaziras,"Heavily influenced by painting and considering cameras as his paintbrushes, Kyriakos Kaziras is a Greco/French photographer known for his pictorial approach. Born in Greece, he developed an interest in art under his two grandfathers' influence – one an artist and the other a keen amateur photographer. When Kaziras was 16, his family moved to Geneva, where he learned French. After that, he moved to France, studying French literature at Sorbonne. The turning point in his career occurred during his first trip to southern Africa – he immediately fell in love with the light, animals, and the intensity of the veldt. He hasn't stopped traveling since, visiting some of the most remote corners of the globe, from polar regions to African plains. Kyriakos Kaziras is based in France.   ",3
Salvador Dali,"One of the most original, innovative, and famous figures in history, Salvador Dali was a Spanish artist who left his mark on the art world a few has managed to do before him. Or after. Remembered for his characteristic mustache and extravagant personality as much as for his creative output, he worked as a painter, sculptor, product and set designer, and he was one of the first artists to tackle film. Known for a unique brand of Surrealism, he combined avant-garde subject matter with academic style, paving the way for generations of artists to come. His visual language, as well as his personal behavior and public actions, remain bizarre, intriguing, and inspiring.  Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech was born in 1904, in the small town of Figueres, close to the French border in Catalonia, Spain. His father was a middle-class lawyer and notary, whose rigorous disciplinary approach was confronted by his wife who encouraged her son's interest in art. Dalí's older brother, who was also named Salvador had died when he was just two years old, in 1903. As a kid, Dalí was taken to his brother's grave and told by his parents that he was his brother's reincarnation, an idea which he came to believe and later incorporate to his artworks. Dalí’s interest in art developed with his attendance at drawing school. In 1917, Dalí's father came to an idea to organize an exhibition of his charcoal drawings in their family home. Dalí's teenage years were marked by a tragic event – his mother died of breast cancer when he was 16 years old. At the age of 18, Dalí moved into the Students' Residence in Madrid. He enrolled into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he befriended Pepín Bello, Luis Buñuel, and Federico García Lorca, who would later become important figures in their areas of interest. Even in this period, Dali knew how to draw attention to himself, either by his looks or by his behavior.   His eccentric fashion style at the time included long hair and sideburns, coat, stockings, and knee-breeches in the style of English aesthetes of the late 19th century. However, it was his painterly skills that earned him the most attention at the academy. At that time, Dali experimented with Cubism, an artistic style not yet known and popularized in Madrid. The only information regarding Cubist art that Dali had was from some magazine articles and a catalog. Still, Dalí never got his degree from the Academy – he was expelled in 1926, right before his final exams when he was accused of starting a conflict. That same year, Salvador made his first visit to Paris, where he met Pablo Picasso, the famous artist whom Dali admired and respected. Picasso had already heard promising reports about Dalí from another renowned painter - Joan Miró, a fellow Catalan who introduced him to many Surrealist friends. Around this period, Dalí grew a flamboyant moustache, influenced by 17th-century Spanish master painter Diego Velázquez. The moustache became a widely recognized and iconic trademark of Dali’s appearance for the rest of his life.   In 1929 in Paris, Dali was introduced to his lifelong muse, inspiration, and future wife Gala. Born as Elena Ivanovna Diakonova in 1894, Gala was a Russian immigrant from the city of Kazan, born to a family of intellectuals. At that time, Gala was married to surrealist poet Paul Éluard, whom she met and fell in love when she was 17. In that same year of 1929, Dalí’s career was on the rise – his works were featured in important exhibitions and he had officially joined the Surrealist group in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris. Dalí and his 10-year-older muse started living together since that same year. The couple married in 1934 in a semi-secret civil ceremony, and in 1958 remarried in a Catholic ceremony. Gala inspired many of Dali’s artworks throughout her life. Furthermore, Gala acted as Dalí's business manager, supporting their extravagant and eccentric lifestyle. During the years, she seemed to tolerate Dalí's flirtations with younger muses, secure in her own position as his primary relationship. As they both aged, Dali continued to paint her portraits, producing compassionate and loving paintings of his muse. Their tense, passionate relationship that lasted over 50 years became the main theme of an opera by Catalan composer Xavier Benguerel, titled I, Dalí. In 1940, as World War II was devastating Europe, Dalí and Gala decided to immigrate to the United States, where they stayed for eight years.  Dalí’s arrival in New York is considered as one of the catalysts and main events in the development of that city as a world art center in the post-War years. What Paris meant for the art world before the World War II, now the Big Apple signifies for the modern and contemporary art. After the move to the US, Dalí returned to the practice of Catholicism. In 1948, Dalí and Gala decided to move back into their house in Port Lligat, on the coast near Cadaqués in Catalonia, Spain. For the next three decades of his life, Dali would spend most of his time in this house, creating art, taking time off and spending winters with his wife in Paris and New York. In 1968, Dalí had bought Gala a castle in Púbol. In 1971, the relationship between the two of them was trembling, and Gala would retreat to her castle only by herself for weeks at a time. Dali couldn’t go to Púbol without written permission from Gala.  This event and a change of heart by his wife further emphasized Dali’s fears of abandonment and estrangement from his longtime artistic muse. All of this led to depression and failing health of the artist. At the age of 76, Dalí's health drastically changed to worse, with his right hand shaking as with Parkinson-like symptoms. Apparently, Gala who has been experiencing senile symptoms at the time, had been dosing her husband with a dangerous mixture of unprescribed medicine that severely damaged his nervous system, and ended his artistic capacity. After Gala's death in 1982, Dalí lost much of his will to live. He purposely dehydrated himself, maybe as a suicide attempt, claiming that he had tried to put himself into a state of suspended animation as he had read that some microorganisms could do. At that time, Dali moved from Figueres to the castle in Púbol, which was the site of Gala’s death and her grave.   Painted in 1931, The Persistence of Memory is one of Dali’s most famous artworks and one of the most famous Surrealist paintings ever made. As one of the most recognized works of Salvador Dali, it is often referenced in today’s popular culture under more descriptive names like ‘The Melting Watches’ or ‘The Soft Watches’. The Persistence of Memory was first shown at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932. The painting is now in a collection of the Museum of Modern Art – MoMA in New York. The MoMA received it in 1934 from an anonymous donor. Painted as a dream landscape, The Persistence of Memory illustrates Dali’s thoughts about time and transience of it, which was central to his thinking at that period. The symbol of melting watches draws upon the relativity of space and time, indicating the collapse of notions of a fixed cosmic order. It's a fact that the artist was fascinated and interested in science, and consequently, it is considered that the painting represents Dali’s interpretation of Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.  However, when Dali was asked about the inspiration for the piece, he responded that the symbol of melting watches was not influenced by the Einstein’s theory, but rather by his surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun. Other forms implied in The Persistence of Memory is Dali’s often-used symbol of ants. One of the clocks is covered by them, and for Dali, ants represent decay and briefness of life. The whole scenery is considered to be located and inspired by the landscapes of Catalonia, more precisely by the tip of Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia. Later in his career, Dali returned to the subject of soft watches and time, producing several sculptures and lithographs based on the same theme. He also painted a different version of the painting in 1954, entitled The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory. This variation depicts the original work’s composition fragmented into an array of systematically separated rectangular blocks, revealing a plateau of another dimension beneath the surface of the original work. The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory is now in the collection of the Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.   Dali used many recurring symbols throughout his prolific career. Apart from the previously mentioned melting watches and the notion of time, other often-used symbols include ants, elephants, lobster and food in general, giraffes and an egg. In his later works, he often referenced recent scientific researches, such as the discovery of DNA and mathematical catastrophe theory. The long-legged elephant is a recurring symbol and one of the best-known icons in Dalí's works, widely popular within our contemporary culture. The image of an elephant first appeared in his 1944 work titled Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second before Awakening, and also in The Temptation of Saint Anthony and Swans Reflecting Elephants. His 1948 painting entitled The Elephants differs from the others because it primarily focuses on the elephant image as the main figure, combined with the empty, deserted background. Dali’s elephants are a great example of how the sense of phantom reality is created. Dalí contrasts classic associations of strength, dominance and power by giving the elephants long, skinny, almost spider-like legs, creating the idea of weightlessness. Other often-used figures, such as the egg, symbolizes hope and love, as Dali connects it to the prenatal and primal feelings. It appears in works such as The Great Masturbator and The Metamorphosis of Narcissus. On the contrary, Dali sees ants and locusts as symbols of death and decay.   Besides painting, Dali was also an important figure in the film industry at the period. His most famous film Un Chien Andalou, translated as An Andalusian Dog, is a 16-minutes long silent surrealist movie created in a collaboration with Luis Buñuel, a Spanish film director. Initially released in 1929, Un Chien Andalou had its first limited screening at the Studio des Ursulines in Paris, with attending guest such as Pablo Picasso, Le Corbusier, Jean Cocteau, Christian Bérard and George Auric, in addition to the whole of André Breton's Surrealist group. These important guests were a part of le tout-Paris - a French expression that describes the prosperous, fashionable and trend-setting elite of the city. An Andalusian Dog was very well accepted by the audience and consequently ran for eight months after the premiere. Such reception surprised and relieved Buñuel, but disappointed Dali, who expected more and was feeling that the viewers’ reaction made the evening much less exciting.  Un Chien Andalou has no conventional narrative, scenes jump from one to another with no particular order or sense, with the chronology of the film fragmented. The whole film is based upon dream logic in story flow that can be described in terms of then-popular Freudian free association, presenting a series of vaguely related scenes, in which the characters and events barely change in a period from “once upon a time” to “eight years later”. The idea behind the film emerged from a friendly chat between Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dali. Both of them were fascinated by the dreams and unconscious, and what the psyche could create. Buñuel told Dalí about a dream in which a cloud sliced the moon in half like a razor blade slicing through an eye – a scene that later become one of the most recognized parts of the movie. Dalí responded that he'd dreamed about a hand crawling with ants. These two dreams were the starting point of the whole movie. They agreed on the only rule for the script - no idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted. Un Chien Andalou’s characteristic and stylistically unique form emerged from this rule - images would change and scenes would switch, leading the viewer in a completely different direction from the one they were previously viewing.  The film is also important because it was the reason behind Dalí’s and Buñuel’s acceptance into the ranks of the Surrealists by the movement's leader André Breton. Later in his career, Dali worked with several other filmmakers, most significantly with Alfred Hitchcock in his Spellbound movie. Salvador was the mind behind the dream sequence in Spellbound, which heavily digs into themes of psychoanalysis. Another important connection between Dali and the film world was his collaboration with Walt Disney on the short film production Destino, which was completed in 2003, after Dali’s death. His untamed creativity has also spanned into the area of photography. He collaborated with several important photographers at the time, including Man Ray, Brassaï, Cecil Beaton and Philippe Halsman. With Man Ray and Brassaï, Dalí photographed nature. As for Philippe Halsman, they collaborated on a series of surrealist portraits of the artist, titled Dalí Atomicus.   Dali and Halsman first met in 1941 and started working together in the late 1940s. Exploring a range of obscure, surrealist themes, the two artists created the famous Dalí Atomica series, the work inspired by Dali’s painting Leda Atomica. The photo, realized after 28 attempts, shows an idea of suspension, depicting three cats flying, a bucket of thrown water, Dalí and chair in mid-air, and Leda Atomica painting in the background. In an unretouched version of the image, the devices and assistants that held up the various props can be seen. Halsman and Dalí continued their collaboration with the book titled Dalí's Mustache. Published in 1954, the book features 36 different versions of the artist's distinctive mustache. Another interesting work that emerged from the collaboration between the two artists is In Voluptas Mors, created in 1951. Photographed after a sketch by Dali, it represents his portrait beside a large skull composed of seven nude female bodies.   Salvador Dali created several surrealist sculptures-objects, most notably Lobster Telephone and Mae West Lips Sofa. Lobster Telephone, also known as Aphrodisiac Telephone was made in 1936, and was composed out of an ordinary functional telephone and a lobster made of plaster. Surrealist poet and patron Edward James bought four of them from Dalí to replace the phones in his home. One is now in a collection of the Tate Gallery, the second is located at the German Telephone Museum in Frankfurt, the third belongs to the Edward James Foundation, and the fourth can be found at the National Gallery of Australia. Another object, Mae West Lips Sofa was made by Dali in 1937. This wood-and-satin sofa was designed after the lips of an American actress Mae West, whom Dalí apparently found fascinating.   In his later years, during the 1960s and 1970s, Dali focused on experimenting with many unusual or novel media and processes. He explored bulletism – a process that involves shooting ink at a blank piece of paper, pointillism, and half-tone dot grids technique, which was later made popular by the artist Roy Lichtenstein. Other concepts that Salvador explored include negative space, visual puns and trompe l'œil visual effects - an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the optical illusion that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions, and holography. His playful endeavors influenced many young aspiring artists of the period, like Andy Warhol. Interested in natural science and mathematics, Dali developed a new perspective, and his late works are created in stylistically different visual language. The artist was also fascinated by the discovery of DNA and the figure of tesseract – a 4-dimensional cube, which is incorporated in his Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus) painting. At some point in this period, Dalí had a glass floor installed in a room near his studio and used it to study foreshortening - the visual effect that causes an object to seem shorter than it actually is because it is angled toward the observer. Accordingly, Dali started to incorporate dramatic perspectives of figures and objects into his artworks.   The Swallow’s Tail, influenced by the mathematical catastrophe theory and completed in 1983, is Salvador Dali’s last painting. Catastrophe theory, developed by Rene Thom, posited that there are seven equilibrium surfaces: fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, and hyperbolic, elliptic and parabolic umbilics. Dali incorporated each of these surfaces into The Swallow’s Tail, alongside the elegant curves of the cello. Dali’s last painting represents more than just a series of shapes and curves – it is also a precise depiction of his understanding of and interest in mathematical theory. In 1989, while his favorite record of Richard Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde played, Dalí died of heart failure at his home in Figueres at the age of 84.

David Yarrow,"An artist followed by an amazing reputation for capturing the beauty of our planet through his camera lens, David Yarrow is an acclaimed fine art photographer who focuses his attentions to remote landscapes, well-hidden cultures and endangered animals. When it comes to the honesty of his work, this artist is unmatched by any fellow photographer - his images are the safest way a person can get to the most dangerous animals in the world and the closest method of witnessing some of the most breathtaking scenes on planet Earth. And on top of that, he possesses a rare talent for style and composition, giving his photos a strong artistic note that really makes them stand out. However, there is a cherry on the top as well - Yarrow has one of the most unusual backgrounds in the world of photography and we are about to tell you his story.  David Yarrow was born during the year of 1966, in Glasgow, a port city on the River Clyde in Scotland's western Lowlands. He was a son of Sir Eric Grant Yarrow and became a part of a famous shipbuilding dynasty, enjoying all the benefits of being a member of such a wealthy family. Initially, he was not interested in photography as he was in other things - he studied accountancy at the Edinburgh University and only played with his camera when the time allowed that. Nevertheless, Yarrow was showing that he has potential in this field as he was pronounced the Young Scottish Photographer of the Year for 1986. This lit a spark behind David and inspired him to continue developing his image-making skills. Soon, he covered the Mexico World Cup as a representer of The Times magazine - if you've ever wondered who shot the epic photo of Maradona holding the world cup trophy, you've finally found the man you were looking for. Despite his obvious talent for photography, David continued to put finances in front of it and found employment as an institutional stockbroker and a Director of Equities at Natwest Securities. It would take over eight full years before he finally decided this was not the right life for him and that he will pursue a 24/7 career in photography, despite rather good circumstances surrounding his current occupation and his ability to handle money rather well. As for what he will be photographing, he made a choice to follow his instinct and make rare animals his prime subjects. Soon he will figure out that working with these creatures of the wild is a lot less stressful than working in the finance sector, as well as much more fulfilling than chasing some meaningless numbers in circles. Although it took some time and doing, David Yarrow made his dream a reality as his life took a radical turning point - he left the world of finance behind him and began traveling the globe, seeking endangered species of animals. Soon, his interest expanded to indigenous communities and landscapes, both of whom were discovered by the photographer as he was looking for the right animals to capture inside a print.  It did not take David too long to make a name for himself as his story of a financial wizard turned artist was already intriguing enough to get attention. However, when the word got out that this newly-baptized photographer was the one behind Maradona's image at the World Cup and that he was truly talented, people really started to take notice. Yarrow’s portraits of wild animals in their natural habitats became a true sensation and were widely regarded as the British bestselling photographs of this genre - something that hasn't really changed to this day. Throughout his career, David went by the simple yet challenging rule set by the war photographer master himself, Robert Capa - he once stated that if a picture isn't good enough, you're not close enough. Following Capa's advice, Yarrow never hesitated to get really, really close to some of the most dangerous animals in the world. And by that we do not mean wolves and snakes - we're talking about great white sharks, polar bears and lion pride. As a result of this kind of commitment and courage, the viewers can safely enjoy in feeding their curiosity about the beauty of the planet’s distant landscapes and its wildlife. Thanks to a wonderful website, you as well can feast your eyes on David's breathtaking photographs that reveal some of the most dangerous and unfortunately endangered animal species of Earth. David mostly works in a strict black and white or a sepia style - this is due to his emotional perspective of things and personal preference, but also because his photos are usually taken before breakfast or at sunset when the light is far from its strongest part of the day. Furthermore, Yarrow claims a certain vulgarity to color images, praising a tranquility and purity found in the black and white images. Not that surprising when you consider his fame and skill, David won a lot of awards over the years but the one that is arguably the most personally proud possession to Yarrow is the title of a Nikon Ambassador - a reward gave to those who are considered to be a lifelong user of Nikon equipment and contributors to the brand's authority. This company can thank David for another aspect of their success as well. Since the photographer put the Nikon equipment through some of the most grueling situations imaginable in search of the most transcendent images, this company's cameras can safely be called some of the most resilient on the market. As far as representation goes, Yarrow is represented by some of the world's leading galleries, with David's images shown at the renowned Perot Museum in Dallas and in a permanent at the new Museum of Natural History in Missouri. Some of his prints have been known to surpass the impressive $60,000 cost, effectively placing Yarrow in an elite circle of photographers. This artist published two fine-art photography books - Nowhere in 2007, presenting some of the world’s most isolated locations, and the awarded Encounter in 2013, concentrating on wildlife and indigenous communities.   As he was starting to expand his subject fields, David Yarrow stopped shooting animals all the time and started dedicating much of his time to exploring some of the key environmental and geopolitical issues of our planet. He is now an affiliated photographer for Tusk - an organization that initializes and funds conservation, community development and environmental education programs in Africa. However, it's the animal shots that David made that make us feel most in awe to him - they are a true result of efforts coming from a curious and brave artist with a sharp eye for details, patience for capturing a unique moment and a very proactive conscience. All of that helped in turning Yarrow into Europe’s best-selling wildlife photographer to date, as well as forming one of the most interesting and unusual biographies in the art scene. The artist is represented by The Cat Street Gallery.  ",5
Kyong Lee,"Kyong Lee is a Korean abstract artist whose work reconciles physical and emotional realities through a multi-disciplined exploration of color, material, process, and form. Lee received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Hongik University in Seoul, Korea, in 1991. She earned her Masters Degree from the University of Fine Arts in Braunschweig, Germany, in 2000. From 2001-2002, Lee was the Artist in Residence at the internationally well known SSamzie Space Studio Residence Program, Seoul, Korea.  Lee is dedicated to precision in her processes. She meticulously plans her color choices and dedicates a fixed amount of time to the mixing of each color. To create her gradated color paintings, she first layers tape in strips across the surfaces. Each layer of paint is applied over a fixed time span and allowed to rest for another fixed amount of time. This is a process of building up, layering, accumulating. The gradations express relationships between colors and moments. Some of her paintings feature text. For these works, Lee embosses the word she has selected for the piece into the surface first then applies a monochromatic hue that correlates to, and collaborates with, the chosen word. The color occupies the word and fills all of the space around it. For Lee, process is poetic, and essential to the meaning of the work.  In her work, Lee is responding to her emotional experiences within her physical surroundings. Color is her primary visual language. For her, color is not only self-referential. Color also relates to emotional states. It is a way of expressing feeling, of projecting thoughts, and of evoking the natural processes of life. Lee is inspired by the flow of time and the layering of experiences. She contemplates memory and the ways her vision of the past changes with the accumulation of time. She is also interested in automatism. Through unconscious processes, she has made connections between different ways of communicating, such as associating specific words with particular hues in her Color as Adjective series. Additionally, Lee is concerned with the tilt of the planet on its axis. Earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees, a condition which causes us to experience the seasons in the way that we do. Lee wonders if there is a correlation here between our false assumption that we are standing horizontally and other assumptions we make, such as our assumptions about, as she says, “the horizon of emotions.”  Work by Kyong Lee has been exhibited extensively in solo and group exhibitions in Korea and Germany. Recent solo exhibitions include Color as Adjective II in Chonan, South Korea, and Feeling, Language, and Color in Seoul. Work by Lee is in multiple public and institutional collections, including that of the Seoul Museum of Art, the Youngeun Museum of Contemporary Art, and the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Art Bank, Seoul, Korea. The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",6
Dan Christensen,"Dan Christensen was an American abstract painter best known for his unfettered use of color in various styles, including Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction and Abstract Expressionism. In his swirling, ribbon-like line paintings, he explored the limits, range, and possibilities of paint and pictorial form. Born in Cozad, Nebraska, in 1942, Christensen decided to become an artist when, as a teenager, he saw the work of Jackson Pollock on a trip to Denver. After receiving his B.F.A. from the Kansas City Art Institute, Missouri, in 1964, he moved to New York City. There, he became part of a large circle of young artists who had come to Manhattan during the 1960s. Christensen came to prominence with ""spray loop"" paintings, produced by using a spray paint gun, characterized by powerful ribbon-like configurations and shimmering allover surface effects. Reversing the trend brought on by minimalism’s reduction of art, these works heralded the revitalization of painting as a visceral experience. His work progressed in several directions, continuing to create luminous marks in his pieces using a variety of applicators like squeegees, brooms, and spray paint guns. ",7
Caroline Christie,"Caroline Christie is a Scottish-born contemporary painter and photographer, best known for her photographs of wild horses. She captured images of these beautiful animals during a journey to Idaho’s Sawtooth Mountains. There she found herself drawn to the ballet-like interplay between these horses, especially pairs of them, who maneuvered around each other like tango dancers tentatively sizing up a new partner. Christie actually has great respect for all nature, especially leaves and their subtle imperfections, harmonious colors, and striking beauty, making them her subject for a series of paintings. Born and raised in the Highlands of Scotland, she moved to the United States in her teens, eventually settling in Western Massachusetts. She is a graduate of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst’s fine art program.   ",8
David Burdeny,"David Burdeny is a Canadian photographer whose works occupy an artistic middle ground between the concrete and the spiritual, the physical and the atmospheric, the actual and the idealized. He seeks to capture the mood and promise, silence and solitude in that one extended moment of awareness, hoping that his personal connection to his subjects and the emotional or intellectual intrigue that grips his through the process will resonate in the final print. Burdeny has a Masters in Architecture and Interior Design and has spent the early part of his career practicing in his field before establishing himself as a photographer.   ",9
Jimmy Nelson,"Jimmy Nelson, born in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1967, is a British photojournalist and photographer known for his portraits of tribal and indigenous peoples. Nelson started working as a photographer in 1987. Having spent 10 years at a Jesuit boarding school in the North of England, he set off on his own to traverse the length of Tibet on foot. The journey lasted a year and upon his return his unique visual diary, featuring revealing images of a previously inaccessible Tibet, was published to wide international acclaim. Soon after, he was commissioned to cover a variety of culturally newsworthy themes, ranging from the Russian involvement in Afghanistan and the ongoing strife between India and Pakistan in Kashmir to the beginning of the war in former Yugoslavia. In early 1994 he and his Dutch wife produced Literary Portraits of China, a 30 month project that brought them to all the hidden corners of the newly opening People’s Republic. Upon its completion the images were exhibited in the People’s Palace on Tiananmen Square, Beijing, and then followed by a worldwide tour. From 1997 onwards Jimmy began to successfully undertake commercial advertising assignments for many of the world’s leading brands. At the same time he started accumulating images of remote and unique cultures photographed with a traditional 50-year-old plate camera. Between 2010 and 2013 Jimmy Nelson travelled the world to document some of the most fantastic indigenous cultures left on the planet today. He had come to realize that from a life spent travelling that his camera was the perfect tool for making contact and building intimate and unique friendships. Relationships with hither to unknown and understood communities in some of the farther most reaches of the planet. He wanted to discover how the rest of the world is threatening to change their way of life forever. But most importantly, he wanted to create an ambitious aesthetic photographic document that would stand the test of time. Jimmy’s projects title “Before they pass away” is intended to be a controversial catalyst for further discussion as to the authenticity of these fragile disappearing cultures. Jimmy Nelson is not a studied scientist but rather a self-trained and visual anthropologist who through curiosity is trying to find answers.  He wants to tell stories that leave room for the recipient’s questions. With the project Jimmy Nelson tried next to creating a photographic document, creating awareness for the fascinating variety of the culture - and history charged symbols of the people, reflecting their rites, customs and traditions, that had hitherto has not existed. Goroka and Kalam in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Karo in the Omo Valley of Africa’s Great Rift Valley, Kazakh in Eastern Europe and northern parts of Central Asia, Tsaatan in the remote subarctic taiga of Mongolia, Ladakhi in the Northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, Maasai in Kenya and Tanzinia, and Mursi in Ethiopia are just a few examples of the people and cultures that Jimmy Nelson has visited and photographed. He is currently based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",10
KAWS,"In the late ’80s and early ’90s, the interesting thing was happening on the streets of Jersey City – one artist came up with the idea of stealing advertising posters by unlocking the glass panels at the bus stops and phone booths. He would add his own graphics in acrylic paint on the posters and return them to their natural habitat, making a funny or harsh statement that ad inspired. That creative was no one else but Brian Donnelly, better known as KAWS, an American artist, so skillful in his pranks that no one could ever distinguish his piece from the original ad. Today, KAWS is a well-known graffiti artist, painter, illustrator, sculptor, toymaker, and product designer.  KAWS was born in 1974 in Jersey City. Growing up in a state in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, he became interested in graffiti in elementary school, where he would spend hours just copying graffiti images to paper. His first influences were neighborhood children, who painted graffiti images on walls within his community. KAWS spent his high school years graffiti-bombing trains, walls, and billboards. He honed his street-art act in New York City, hanging out with the spray can–wielding skate kids in downtown Manhattan. KAWS graduated to a more covert form of interventionist street art in the mid-’90s, when he began unlocking the glass panels encasing bus stop and phone booth ads, stealing the poster, changing it and putting it back. Later, moving to New York City in the 1990s, KAWS continued subverting imagery on billboards, bus shelters, and phone booth advertisements. These reworked advertisements were at first left alone, lasting for up to several months, but as KAWS’ popularity skyrocketed, the ads became extremely popular and his fans would search the entire city to find and take them home. In addition to New York, KAWS has done interventions in Paris, London, Berlin, and Tokyo.   KAWS graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in illustration in 1996. After graduation, he briefly worked for Disney as a freelance animator, painting backgrounds. He participated in animation of the animated series like 101 Dalmatians or Daria and Doug. In the late 90s, KAWS began to design and produce limited edition vinyl toys - an instant hit with the global art toy-collecting community especially in Japan, where this genre is well respected and widespread. In those years, KAWS traveled to Japan, pursuing his street art projects with Tokyo subculture heavyweights Hectic and Jun Takahashi of Undercover. In 1999, KAWS made his first toy with Japanese company Bounty Hunter, a vinyl figure of Mickey Mouse with x-'ed out eyes (as if Mickey just drank from a bottle marked POISON - this image was even incorporated into a balloon for the 2012 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade). His street-born cartoonish graphics—specifically shaped figures with x-'ed out eyes entitled spermatozoa—have achieved a subculture iconography. He has applied this KAWS signature to his street art, a clothing line, heroically outsize toys and sculptures, and countless co-branding ventures: KAWS participated in commercial collaborations with Nigo for A Bathing Ape, Jun “Jonio” Takahashi for Undercover, Michael ""Mic"" Neumann for Kung Faux, snowboard projects with Burton, and sneakers with Nike and Vans, Comme des Garçons… More toys and later clothing were made for Original Fake, a recent collaborative store with Medicom Toy, in the Aoyama district of Tokyo where an original limited edition product is released each week.    KAWS’ acrylic paintings and sculpture have many repeating images, all meant to be universally understood, surpassing languages and cultures. One of KAWS' early series, Package Paintings was made in 2000. This series, entitled The Kimpsons, subverted the famous American cartoon, The Simpsons. KAWS explains that he found it weird how infused a cartoon could become in people's lives; the impact it could have, compared to regular politics. In addition, KAWS has reworked other familiar icons such as Mickey Mouse, the Michelin Man, the Smurfs, and SpongeBob SquarePants. KAWS books like C10 and early exhibition catalogs are rare and collectors items. The first comprehensive survey of the artist’s oeuvre was a monograph from Skira/Rizzoli in 2009, written by Mónica Ramírez-Montagut, a curator at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. Through this publication, KAWS has gotten approval from an art-world establishment that he felt would never take his guerrilla act as its own. Soon after, he bought a building not far from his Brooklyn studio, which his good friend, the interior designer Katayama, converted into a massive studio that will become the creative hub of the KAWS universe.    In 2013, KAWS was commissioned to redesign the VMAs’ Moonman award, giving the silver spaceman his first facelift in 30 years. The artist said it was such a strong, iconic thing to be in charge of. As he thought, everyone sees the Moonman and knows right off the bat what it is, the task seemed if not impossible, then at least extremely difficult. KAWS explained that when he was first invited to do the project, he knew that he didn’t want to create something new entirely. What KAWS desired was to create something that the public will see immediately as his work, but as the evergreen Moonman, as well. Casted in a striking gunmetal finish, it features several of the flourishes that have made his artworks instantly recognizable in galleries and on street corners around the world — namely, the comical skull-and-crossbones head and cartoonish gloves of Companion — while, at the same time, remaining faithful to the iconic award that’s been handed out to the biggest names in music for almost 3 decades.   In September 2014, KAWS artworks were on display in the show entitled  Man’s Best Friend at Honor Fraser in Culver City, CA. In Man’s Best Friend series, KAWS reinterprets the beloved American beagle Snoopy, along with other familiar shapes from the cast of the syndicated cartoon Peanuts, reworking them with the vividness, brightness, displacement, and playful abstraction he’s known for. Man’s Best Friend is an exceptional collection of artworks which shows the artist taking from the creative ethos of his stylistic progenitors and modifying a standard in the American cartoon world, giving his audience a glimpse of its transformation in development. These days, it sounds like he’s taking his time with his art, and taking a step back to look at the bigger picture.   In 2014, music star Pharrell teamed up with KAWS and Comme des Garcons on a fragrance for both men and women. Titled Girl and based on Pharrell’s ongoing infatuation with the fairer sex, the bottle, logo, and packaging had been designed by House + Holme, featuring bold, cartoonish artwork by KAWS. His practice is greatly influenced by iconic characters from modern pop culture, so KAWS’ work treads the fine line between art, commerce, cartoons, and commercials. It distorts, yet at the same time, pays homage to, all objects produced, bought, sold, exchanged, desired, and cherished; the essence of American consumerism. Using his skills through various disciplines and mediums, KAWS ties together hip hop, skateboarding and cartoon culture all in one perfectly positive, a pristine vision of impossible perfection. His oeuvre is also a joy to behold; an all singing all dancing fun-packed celebration of positivity, life, and fun. His work is a craft, a skill that most mere mortals couldn't even begin to comprehend. As he grew older, his influences came from traditional life painters, such as Gerhard Richter, Klaus Oldenberg, and Chuck Close.   ",11
Christos J. Palios,"Raised as a first-generation Greek/American, a son of immigrants, Christos J. Palios is a photographer whose personal perspectives were forger by two very distinct and equally fascinating cultures. Intrigued by architecture, history, culture, and socioeconomics, his “long-term photographic work is rooted in research and probes themes of identity, connection, nostalgia, and isolation.” His origins are embedded in the visual art with an emphasis on design and animation, culminating in a BFA (summa cum laude) from the University of Maryland. However, for as long as he can recall, “photography’s remarkable capacity to communicate ideas and narratives inspire me to embody insight and intent within the frame.” Since 2006, Christos J. Palios has been pursuing art full-time.   ",12
Mauricio Velez,"Mauricio Velez is a Colombian photographer whose images are meant to refine the sensitivity and perception of the viewer towards art and the human body. The subjects are elevated to an aesthetic level that can either inspire or disturb, but whose intention is to confront the viewer with an image.   ",13
Chad Kleitsch,"Chad Kleitsch is an American photographer and educator. He has taught Photography at Bard College, Yale University, Sarah Lawrence College, and The Center for Photography at Woodstock. Born and raised in New Jersey, he studied photography at Bard College, earning his B.A. in 1991. Kleitsch's work has been featured in numerous exhibitions in museums and galleries throughout the United States and has appeared in various publications, including The New York Times, Time Magazine, and Money Magazine. While living at a Zen monastery in 1997, he began using a scanner as a camera, further evolving the photographic process known as scanography. In Kleitsch's words, ""using the scanner as the camera, is a rediscovery of image making. It's reminiscent of mirrors, in both process and aesthetics, the historic images of those first photograms and cyanotypes."" Chad Kleitsch lives and works in Rhinebeck, NY.   ",14
Md Tokon,"Md Tokon is a Bangladesh-born and New York-based contemporary painter whose works are purely abstract and have a great touch of impressionism. While working, he applies many layers of paint using gesture, an internal sense of color, and breathe of emotion, focusing on bringing the expressive colors and Melodious area to the canvas. His most noted influences come from abstract expressionism, and his work can be characterized as Lyrical and atmospheric abstraction, where all of his pieces have a significant abstract expression focused on the depiction of emotions rather than objects. Tokon moved to New York in 2001, successfully absorbing what is universal and important from both cultures and incorporating the essence of both the East and the West into his work.   ",15
Peter Andrew Lusztyk,"Canadian artist Peter Andrew Lusztyk uses photography to turn ordinary and overlooked things into something beautiful. He has developed a shooting style and mantra of 'getting the shot no matter what' to show the viewers the world as he sees it. That's why he's just as comfortable shooting from a helicopter as he is working in a studio. With a body of work that encompasses advertising, location, portrait, and landscape photography, Lusztyk has worked with numerous high-caliber clients, including The National Geographic, Le Monde, The Royal Canadian Geographic Society, Apple, Hyundai, American Express, etc. The artist has received numerous awards throughout his career, including the PX3 Paris Photography Award in 2012, the Applied Arts Photographer of the Year Award in 2013, and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Communication Arts Awards.   Peter Andrew Lusztyk, born in 1982, while studying at the University of Toronto's Institute of Communication Culture and Information Technology, began working in the Toronto's East End photographic studio, where he started learning about photography. By 2009 he began freelancing and working full time as a photographer. One of his earliest works is the series of photographs of major interstates and roadways across the US, which is still ongoing. The aerial shots are taken after careful planning from helicopters and planes. In the hope of expanding the project to the rest of the world, the artist's goal is to shoot 100 highways, including the highly intricate and complex interchanges in China. For Lusztyk, they are a source of infinite inspiration, as vast amounts of details are contained within one photo.      Inspired by Robert Longo's Body Hammers (1993), Lusztyk created the Point Blank series. To capture the perspective of looking down a gun's barrel, he has created unnerving shots of various handguns. The portraits of the machines are done with a fantastic amount of details, from scratched barrels to all the tiny imperfections that help demystify these highly feared and, at the same time, fetishized objects of destruction. Lusztyk said: The series Point blank has been exhibited in France, the UK, Canada, and the US; published in Esquire, The Atlantic Le Monde, and Daily Mail, and made an appearance in the Netflix series Hemlock Grove and film The Husband (2013).   In 2019 Lusztyk created the Currency series, featuring Canadian dollar bills. These seemingly ordinary objects evoke a deep sense of nostalgia for the artist due to the Bird Series of Canadian money, which was in circulation when he was younger. Lusztyk hopes that these massive depictions of small objects are jarring enough so that people will take a closer look instead of just passing by. The artist has opened a photographic studio and instructs upper-year students at the Sheridan College. Peter Andrew Lusztyk lives and works in Toronto.  ",16

Andy Warhol,"It was the beginning of the 1950s when the art world got a new movement which became one of the greatest among those of the 20th century. Inspired by the imagery of popular culture, Pop Art both celebrated and criticized consumption choices and mass (re)production achieving the enormous success in the course of the next five decades and beyond. The artist who played a major role in the development of the new movement was American artist Andy Warhol. He was a true mastermind of his time creating some of the most iconic images of the 20th century that re-defined many concepts and introduced fresh ones that became new standards in no time. Almost thirty years after his death, his life and art that embraced consumerism and a culture of mass production continue to fascinate creative thinkers and art lovers worldwide. Working in a wide range of media including printmaking, painting, hand drawing, silk screening, sculpture, photography, music and film, Warhol gained an international recognition for his images of soup cans, soda bottles, dollar bills and iconic paintings of celebrities like Mick Jagger, Elvis Presley, Jimmy Carter, Prince, and Elizabeth Taylor.  The youngest child of three, Andy was born Andrew Warhola on August 6, 1928, in a working class suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His parents, Julia, and Ondrej Warhola were Carpatho-Rusyns who immigrated from what is now known as eastern Slovakia in the early 1920's. He learned to draw when he was six years old and bedridden with illness. Stricken at an early age with a Chorea — also known as St. Vitus's Dance — a rare and sometimes fatal disease of the nervous system, the young Warhol was suddenly bedridden for several months. It was during these months, that his mother and brothers would entertain him for hours by showing him how to draw, trace and print images. Drawing soon became his preferred childhood activity. He was also an avid fan of popular celebrity magazines, movies and DC comic books, imagery he would return to years later. After his father died in 1942, Warhol graduated from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh in 1945, and enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology (presently Carnegie-Mellon University), graduating in June 1949 with a major in pictorial design.    Shortly after graduation, Andy boarded an overnight train to New York City to pursue the world of art. It was also at this time that he dropped the ""a"" in his last name and began his professional life as a commercial illustrator. His first assignment was for Glamour magazine, an article called Success is a Job in New York in September 1949. Additionally, he was commissioned by some of the major fashion magazines including Glamour, Vogue, The New York Times, Tiffany & Co., and Harper’s Bazaar, which led him to become one of the most sought-after American illustrators of the 1950s. He won numerous awards for his uniquely whimsical style, including Art Directors' Club Medal in 1957 while he was hired as the exclusive illustrator for I. Miller, a shoe company.   After establishing himself as an acclaimed graphic artist and illustrator, he turned to painting and drawing in the 1950s. His first one-man exhibition was held in 1952 at the Hugo Gallery. Entitled Fifteen drawings based on the writings of Truman Capote, the show included many of these sketchbook drawings of a young writer, which appear as a precursor to his later depictions of celebrities. In 1956, his work was included in a collective show at MoMA in New York. Following this success, Warhol opened his own studio, The Factory, in 1962. It became a meeting place for artists and musicians such as Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, and Mick Jagger. Less frequent visitors included Salvador Dalí and Allen Ginsberg. Warhol collaborated with Reed's influential New York rock band the Velvet Underground in 1965 and designed the noted cover for The Velvet Underground & Nico, the band's debut album.   In the early 1960s, Warhol established his reputation as the world’s foremost Pop Artist. He began to make fine art by transferring images onto paper or canvas using the silkscreen process, a method of creating an image on paper, fabric or some other object by pressing ink through a screen with areas blocked off by a stencil. Formerly artists were using this technique as a simple means of reproducing their own work. Warhol made it his own by choosing existing images he found in newspapers and magazines and then transferring them onto paper and fabric. The paintings of dollar bills, mushroom clouds, electric chairs, Coca-Cola bottles as well as images of celebrities such as Marlon Brando and Mao Zedong, are just a few works from Warhol’s huge oeuvre which are now considered to be amongst the most important and influential pieces in the post-war era. Amongst silkscreen printmaking, he also concentrated on producing paintings, photographs, films and videos and his very own Interview magazine. Campbell’s Soup Cans, also known as 32 Campbell's Soup Cans, canvases are among Warhol’s earliest paintings based on American consumer goods, and some of his first works that feature serial images. Produced in 1962, Warhol's soup cans raise the simply popular or everyday to the status of art. At a glance, Campbell's Soup Cans looks like a series of repetitions of the same can on similar 20-inch-by-16-inch canvases. The difference between them can be found on closer inspection of the names on both the cans and the paintings — these represent the 32 varieties that Campbell's sold at the time. The individual canvases were created by a printmaking method — the semi-mechanized screen printing process, using a non-painterly style. Campbell's Soup Cans’ reliance on themes from popular culture helped to usher in pop art as a major art movement in the United States.  Warhol’s dollar sign is one of the most iconic Pop art symbols, just along Coca-Cola bottles and Campbell’s Soup cans. The first pieces from the series were executed in 1962. Front and Back Dollar Bills is the only diptych from the Dollar Bills series – a work where Warhol explored the graphic potential of the ubiquitous United States note to its fullest. He separated a dollar bill into its black and green constituent parts – whereby the left panel articulates the front of the bill in a sumptuous jet black and the right panel illustrates the back of the dollar in rich, hookers green. The work is characterized by the recognizable Pop Art aesthetic.   Green Coca-Cola Bottles — the image of a single Coca-Cola bottle repeated in regular rows, seven high by sixteen across, above the company’s logo — was created by Andy Warhol in 1962. The repetition of the bottles not only reflects the dominance of Coca-Cola in the American society at the time but also helps to convey the message that the richest and the poorest share the identical product. The silkscreen technique artist developed, allowed him to produce his paintings through a mechanical process that paralleled his use of mass culture subjects. While the image can be printed endlessly, no one image is the same due to the nature of silk screening. The same year, Warhol created a unique hand-painted picture Coca-Cola (3). The piece depicts monumental bottle of Coca-Cola and is often considered to be a founding painting of the Pop Art movement, which celebrated popular culture and consumerism in post-World War II America.   Marilyn Diptych painting by Warhol was created in 1962 as a tribute to the legendary Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe who had died just weeks earlier. It contains fifty images of the actress, which are all based on a single publicity photograph from the 1953 film Niagara, in which Marilyn starred. The twenty-five pictures on the left side of the diptych are vibrantly colored while the twenty-five on the right are made in black and white evoking the relation between the celebrity's life and death. Marilyn Diptych was bought by Tate in London in 1980 and it’s still part of the museum’s collection. It is considered to be one of the most recognizable pieces of art created in the 20th Century. Warhol took the film star and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe as his subject in a different media including silkscreen paintings and tapestry. The Shot Marilyns is a set of four canvases made in 1964, each a square measuring 40 inches and each consisting of a painting of the actress, each shot through in the forehead by a single bullet. Originally, the artist produced a total of five Marilyns – red, orange, light blue, sage blue, and turquoise and stacked four of them up against the wall of his NY studio The Factory. The artist's studio was the place where a lot of people hung out. One of them was Dorothy Podler who was a friend of one of Factory photographer. On an autumn day in 1964, Podler came in Factory and asked Warhol if she could shoot the paintings. Warhol thought that by “shoot” she had meant to photograph them, so he agreed, but she actually took the revolver from her purse and shot the pieces, which were named the “The Shot Marilyns.” The fifth painting with the turquoise background was not in the stack.     In 1968, Valerie Jean Solanas, an American radical feminist writer attempted to murder Warhol. She had crossed paths with Warhol two years earlier, asking him to produce a play she had written. The artist, whose films were often shut down by the police for obscenity, thought the script was so pornographic that it must have been a police trap so he told her that he lost it. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, A Man (1967). Outraged by his rejection and the fact that he had lost his copy of her play, Solanas went to The Factory on June 3, 1968. She found the artist and shot at him three times, with the first two shots missing and the final wounding Warhol. She also shot art critic Mario Amaya and attempted to shoot Warhol's manager, Fred Hughes. After the shooting, Warhol was pronounced dead, but doctors resuscitated him and he survived after emergency surgery. Solanis turned herself in to authorities and was placed in a mental hospital where she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Later, she was sentenced to three years in prison. The attack had a profound impact on Warhol’s life and his work, and security at the Factory scene became much stronger afterward. For the rest of his life, the artist lived in fear that Solanas would attack him again.   In the early 1970s, he started to do commissioned portraits with his Polaroid Big Shot camera. The list of his subjects includes stars, artists and high-society types such as Diane Keaton, Gianni Agnelli, Marella Agnelli, Janet Villella, Marlon Brando, Joseph Beuys, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Brigitte Bardot, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Martha Graham, John McEnroe, Muhammad Ali, Francesco Clemente, Keith Haring, Diana Ross, Alfred Hitchcock, Albert Einstein, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, Julia Warhola, Jimmy Carter, Prince and many others. One of his most famous portrait depicting Chinese Communist leader Zedong was created in 1973.  Warhol’s creative process almost exclusively began with a Polaroid shots. After selection of his favorite image, it would be rephotographed, printed and silkscreened onto canvas by his assistants. The resulting image became the ground and basis of each painting. He would take several packs of film at each sitting, and then select his favorite image to be silkscreened onto canvas by his assistants. The resulting image became the ground and basis of each painting. Proving that the simplest tools are no impediment to creativity, Warhol's Polaroids are both a celebration of fame and an intriguing look at the cleverness behind the façade Warhol so often used to disguise the intelligence and innovation of his work. In recent years, Warhol's Polaroids have gained attention and respect in shows and books. In January 2015 his Society Portraits were on view at Jablonka Maruani Mercier Gallery.    The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again) was first published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1975. The book represents a collection of Warhol's thoughts on a variety of topics including love, art, sex, fame, death, money, and beauty. Many of the Andy Warhol's quotes including those about Polaroids and the notions of narcissism, the American consumerism, and the art market success, are still more than relevant today. Amongst The Philosophy of Andy Warhol, he published a, A Novel (1968), Popism: The Warhol Sixties (1980) and The Andy Warhol Diaries (1989). He was also a founder of the Interview magazine along with a British journalist John Wilcock in 1969.    In the late 1970s, Warhol met the famous painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the two artists formed a close connection and one of the most interesting artist partnerships of the 20th century. Between the years 1984-1985, Warhol and Basquiat fused their different styles of painting into a dynamic group of collaborative works on canvas. The great example is the piece Olympic Rings (1985) — created as their artistic response to the 1984 Olympic Games held in LA. Warhol made several variations of the Olympic five-ring symbol, rendered in the original primary colors while Basquiat responded to the abstract, stylized logos with his oppositional graffiti style.    Andy Warhol's monumental final cycle The Last Supper (1986) was commissioned by the art dealer Alexandre Iolas, who offered Warhol a show in Milan right across the street from Santa Maria delle Grazie, home of Leonardo's masterpiece. Using commercial reproductions as his source material, Warhol worked on the project on and off for a year, creating more than sixty silkscreens, paintings, and works on paper. Some of the pieces include a black-light Last Supper, a camouflage Last Supper, a couple of Minimalist Last Suppers, and various Last Suppers incorporating commercial logos for the likes of Camel and Wise potato chips. Inspired by da Vinci’s Christ image, Warhol and Basquiat created a collaborative sculpture Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper) in 1986.   After he shot his first film in 1963, the artist became increasingly active as an experimental filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made almost 650 films, including hundreds of silent Screen Tests, or portrait films, and dozens of full-length movies that challenged the conventions of filmmaking. Sleep (1963) was one of his first experiments with filmmaking and was created as an ""anti-film"". Shot on 16mm film and running just under five-and-a-half hours in length – the film consists solely of a half-dozen randomly repeated shots of poet John Giorno asleep in the nude. Warhol would later extend this technique to his notorious, black and white, eight-hour silent film Empire (1965). My Hustler (1965), a social comedy about gay life was shot over the Labor Day weekend in 1965 on Fire Island. Warhol achieved first major commercial success after a long line of avant-garde films with Chelsea Girls a 1966 experimental underground film. Today he widely recognized as one of the most important filmmakers of the 1960s.     Andy Warhol died on February 22, 1987, at the age of 58, in a New York hospital, due to complications following an operation. There are still much debate and consideration of his personal life. He is widely believed to have been a gay man, and his art often explored the complexity of sexuality and desire. However, in a 1980 interview, Warhol indicated that he was a virgin for his entire life. Soon after artist’s death, in accordance with his will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. Two years later, the Andy Warhol Museum was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, artist’s hometown. It is one of the most comprehensive single-artist museums in the world, which includes more than 4,000 works of art by Warhol including paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, films and videos.   Over five decades since it emerged, Pop Art remains relevant in the modern age and still has many influences in our everyday lives, while Warhol’s pieces continue to serve as inspiration for numerous artists’ work. His influence on subsequent generations of artists continues to be immeasurable and it can most obviously be seen in their illustrations, prints, and posters with such details as strong and multiple colors, series of images on one print and famous people faces. Almost three decades after his death, Warhol is still one of the art world’s leading man. ",19
Markus Klinko,"Markus Klinko is an award-winning fashion and celebrity photographer, whose dazzling images can be seen on many album covers of music stars. He works with today's most eminent film and fashion personalities and he is often engaged in creating advertising and fund raising campaigns. In March 2016, he got into the media spotlight because of releasing unseen photographs of the legendary music icon, David Bowie. Klinko’s high-end work is regularly featured in publications such as Vogue Italia, Vanity Fair, GQ, The New York Times, Madame Figaro, Stereo Review, and Ongaku no Tomo.  Klinko was born in Switzerland in the early 60s. His origin is quite unusual – he is of French, Italian, and Hungarian descent. As a young boy, Klinko wasn’t so much into photography – he was getting prepared to become a harp soloist and he studied at a music school in Paris. He has even signed a recording contract with EMI Classics and received an eminent prize for his recording of harp music. However, after an accident and hand injury, it became hard for Klinko to play musical instruments and he decided to dedicate himself to fashion photography and retire from his music career. Around the same time, he met a digital artist called Indrani, with whom he started to collaborate. Klinko’s work was outstanding from the very beginning and soon he started to get hire for various shoots. One of his early assignments was shooting David Bowie and his wife Iman. Later on, he began creating images for album covers of the most famous pop singers, such as Beyonce's Dangerously in Love and Mariah Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi albums.   Klinko’s list of celebrities he photographed is quite long and worth admiring. He collaborated with Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Kanye West, Anne Hathaway, Kate Winslet, Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kim Kardashian and Naomi Campbell, to name a few most important ones. He also did spectacular editorials for big clients like Vogue, GQ, Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar as well as advertising campaigns for many luxurious brands such as Lancome, L'Oreal Paris, Hugo Boss and Skyy Vodka. His most successful campaign for Keep A Child Alive project has raised more than million dollars for children with AIDS in just a couple of days. Many galleries and museums in Europe have showcases Klinko’s work and he has appeared as a guest speaker in TV and reality shows, for instance in E! News, Access Hollywood, Fashion Television and Double Exposure.   In March 2016, in Lich Feld gallery in Basel, Klinko has held a show called Unseen Bowie, which featured his photographs of the recently deceased cult musician. The prints of these photographs are available at the same gallery in Basel and further exhibitions of Unseen Bowie will follow across the world since they have already won a great success. Klinko was collaborating with Bowie while he was omnipresent in the news and at the peak of his career and he also photographed the cover of his album Heathen. After Bowie’s death in January 2016, Klinko decided to give his portraits a new life. All the original portraits were done using the Fujifilm Provia medium format film, which is designed for high-quality prints. The photographs which were exhibited in Basel are limited editions available in various sizes, and they are autographed by Klinko. The artist still uses medium format films to shoot his award-winning images, and he was also one of the first professional photographers who started using new Fujifilm X-Pro2.   Markus Klinko’s photography is all about technical perfection and glamour – he documented the appearance of the most popular celebrities in a breathtakingly beautiful way. His usage of best photo gear such as medium format films and his careful, immaculate compositions speak of his enviable technical and artistic aptitude. Klinko’s portraits are amongst the top artworks of fashion photography and because of their straightforward beauty, they are sought for by a huge and diverse audience. The artist is represented by Markowicz Fine Art.  ",20

Tyler Shields,"Hailing from Jacksonville, Florida, Tyler Shields is a Los Angeles-based photographer, film director, and writer best known for his provocative and sometimes controversial images of Hollywood celebrities such as Heather Morris, Mischa Barton, Lindsay Lohan, Emma Roberts, Zachary Quinto, Nina Dobrev and Demi Lovato. Often described as “Celebrity shock photographer”, Shields creates images that often involve violence and splattered blood. He pushes his subjects to their limits when shooting to achieve real-time live action without manipulation and though some feel the art of Tyler Shields is put out to the world purely for shock value and to provoke, the photographer insists that many of the images he creates come from simple everyday situations that trigger thoughts.   Born in 1982, Tyler Shields began his career as a professional inline skater, competing in the 1999 and 2000 X Games, a sports event, controlled and arranged by American sports broadcaster ESPN, which focuses on extreme sports. In 2003, Shields toured with Tony Hawk, one of the most famous skateboarder of all time. However, this athlete wanted to do more so at the age of 18, he moved to LA. Shields got his start as a photographer by releasing his images and videos on MySpace in 2003. “I took a picture of a closet that became really famous on the internet back in the days when MySpace first started. A girlfriend cheated on me, so I took all her shit and I threw it out.” An advertising agency saw this picture, bought it off him and even commissioned him to shoot an ad campaign. Soon afterward, Shields began doing gallery shows rapidly establishing himself as one of the future icons of his generation. His unique style blends the indie urban contemporary with mainstream sex appeal.   The controversial images by Tyler Shields frequently draw criticism from animal rights activists and women’s groups. In 2011, he was criticized for a photoshoot with Glee star Heather Morris with a bruised eye as making light of abusive treatment of women. This resulted in a massive 25,000 emails reaching his inbox about the images and he was forced to remind people that he is an artist and not a fashion photographer, which he followed by auctioning the photos and donating the money to domestic abuse awareness. Also in 2011, Shields’ photographs of former The O.C. star Mischa Barton with slabs of meat were condemned by feminist groups claiming it objectified women and the photographer even received death threats over the images, which he claims objectifies the meat rather than the woman. After posting the photos to Shields’s website showing Barton gnawing on raw beef, as well as laying a slab of it across her face, PETA also took notice, and issued a written statement chastising both the actress and the photographer.   For show entitled Life Is Not a Fairytale in 2011 he collected blood from 20 celebrities, including Glee actress Jenna Ushkowitz, former Darcy's Wild Life TV star Shannon Collis, producer and entrepreneur Brent Bolthouse and carrot-topped film financier Ryan Kavanaugh, to make a canvas painted with the blood. The event, which combined photography, art show, video screening and various performances, included a shot of a princess' legs in sequin shoes and a magic wand both stained with blood; Emma Roberts eating a large chunk of bloody meat; Lindsay Lohan solo shots as well as her posing with The Vampire Diaries star Michael Trevino in a neck-biting situation. Regarding Lohan, this was not the first time that the artist collaborated with the sometimes troubled singer, actress and model. In 2010, she tweeted Tyler requesting to shoot, he tended to the request. In the resulting images, Lohan is both seductive vampire and gun-brandishing femme fatale. In one of the photographs, she is depicted against a blood-spattered backdrop, holding a knife to her own throat; in another one, she sits astride a man already covered in blood, with knife raised as if to deliver the fatal blow.   His series of photographs Indulgence shows how high-end brands have taken over our lives through its ubiquity and utility. It presents luxury goods with a satirical edge. The photoshoot was taken in downtown LA, featuring actress Ana Mulvoy Ten and a hungry friend of the reptilian variety. The photos of the actress snacking on Prada popcorn or drinking from a Louis Vuitton champagne bottle – a truly eye-catching statement on brand mania. The Silver Shadow series depicts a young couple dousing the car with gas before setting it ablaze for an inevitable explosion. The video was shot on RED Dragon cameras that can shoot 100-150fps slow-motion videos at 5K and 6K resolutions, alongside a number of other DSLRs and medium format cameras. The Silver Shadow pieces were on display in October 2014 at the Imitate Modern gallery in London. This was not the first time Shields has destroyed expensive objects in the name of art. In 2012, Shields released a photograph of his girlfriend Francesca Eastwood burning, sawing, and biting a $100,000 Hermès Birkin Bag for a photoshoot.   Tyler Shields uses no special effects or stunt doubles as he documents people engaged in such extreme activities as leaping off buildings, getting bitten, tied up, punched, dragged, and coming perilously close to being burned. Although it was originally planned as a series of self-portraits, his series of photographs entitled Suspense features actress Emma Roberts and Shields’ longtime girlfriend Francesca Eastwood voluntarily jumping off buildings and bridges – they are frozen at the height of the action, suspended in midair and about to either crash to the ground or take flight into the sky.    Historical Fiction is one of Tyler Shields’ latest series of works photographed in locations across the United States over a period of twelve months through early 2015. The large-scale photographs depicts Shields’ interpretations of iconic moments and individual reactions to 1960s American political and pop culture history including the first men on the moon, the disbanding of The Beatles, the Golden Age of air travel, racial violence, and the deaths of James Dean, John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Marilyn Monroe. The photos were on view at Andrew Weiss Gallery in May 2015.   In November 2013, Tyler Shields released his debut photographic book, The Dirty Side of Glamour, which contained the erotic photographs and art of Tyler Shields based on his work with the young Hollywood elite, aimed at capturing the fame, youth, excess and trappings of celebrity. His second book Provocateur, released in December 2016, brings together in a single lavish volume an array of provocative imagery, from the photos of luxury objects set on fire to the feeding of alligators with Birkin bags. Featuring over 500 photographs, the book exposes Shields’ bravery as an artist who is not afraid to push the boundaries of contemporary photography. To date, Shields has had over twenty solo exhibitions worldwide including Imitate Modern, London, England; Miller Gallery, Cincinnati, OH; Samuel Lynne Gallery, Dallas, TX; Guy Hepner Gallery, LA, CA; and Andrew Weiss Gallery, Santa Monica, CA. In addition to his Fine Art photographs, he has shot campaigns for brands like Nike, Adidas, Playboy, Harley Davidson, and Gergé Swiss watches, among others.   Amongst his photography career, Shields is also a highly talented film director. In 2014, he completed filming his feature length Final Girl starring Oscar Nominated Abigail Breslin and Hunger Games’ Wes Bentley. Final Girl is an American action thriller film, written by Adam Prince, based on the story by Stephen Scarlata, Alejandro Seri, and Johnny Silver. The same year Shields' script The Wild Ones was listed in the Black List, being ranked at #6; and published the first in his completed series of 6 novels Smartest Man.  In 2016, Tyler Shields's net worth was estimated to be $1 million dollars which puts him at the very top level among other professional photographers. Although he was known as a talented inline skater who competed in the X Games, Tyler Shields career as a photographer is considered as the one that has brought most of financial success to him. However, photography isn’t only increased the size of Tyler Shields net worth but made him one of the internationally most famous photographers. Described by the Daily Mail as “Hollywood’s Favorite Photographer”, the iconic artist made a name for himself with his potent, alluring and often controversial photos. The artist is represented by Imitate Modern.  ",23
Eric Dever,"An American abstract artist, Eric Dever began his career through a controlled use of a limited color palette and tight grids, only to embrace the entire color spectrum and loose shapes over the years. Over the last decade, he has pursued intensely focused investigations into methods and materials, creating works which gradually have evolved into sensitively executed and intimate works of art. Born in 1962 in Los Angeles, Dever enrolled Otis College of Art and Design and later graduating from California Lutheran University. In 1986, he moved to New York to continue his studies, where he stayed and established studios in Williamsburg, Brooklyn followed by the East Village. For several years, Dever limited his palette to white, Zinc and Titanium White, uncovering a white spectrum ranging from opacity to translucency. While his early compositions were largely geometric, over the years, Dever began exploring free shapes and tactile surfaces executed with brush and knife. He also began introducing the colors black and red into his work, soon embracing the full spectrum that was coupled with his awareness of the yogic notion of the chakras. ",24

Pablo Picasso,"If the word “art” was to be presented to any individual regardless of his or her involvement in the world of art or knowledge of the subject, there’s a high chance that they’ll think of a very specific name. Pablo Picasso was one of the most renowned and influential artist of his time whose expertise spanned painting, sculpting, stage designing, poetry, playwright, and other areas.  With a Spanish origin, his long career is filled with unparalleled achievements of creating not just brilliant artwork but art movements themselves. Redefining artistic practice and its purpose, his name resonates not only through the 20th century, but the history and future of art.   Pablo Ruiz y Picasso was born in Málaga, in the Andalusian region of Spain. His real name was pretty gargantuan - Pablo Diego Jose Santiago Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Crispin Crispiniano de la Santisima Trinidad Ruiz Blasco Picasso y Lopez - Pablo was named after various saints and relatives. Even though he was baptized a Catholic, Picasso would later on become an atheist. When he was born, the midwife thought he was stillborn; it was a difficult birth and he was such a weak baby that the midwife even left him on the table to attend his mother. It was thanks to his uncle, a doctor named Don Salvador, that Pablo was saved:  His mother was Maria Picasso y Lopez (the artist used her surname from around 1901 on) and his father, José Ruiz y Blasco, was a painter and a professor of art. He started teaching art to Pablo when the boy was seven years old. Pablo completed his first painting, Le Picador, when he was only nine years old and it depicted a man riding a horse in a bullfight. Pablo’s father vowed to give up painting when Picasso was 13 years old because he felt his son was already a better painter than himself. Ruiz Blasco continued to teach at art schools, but could never bring himself to paint again.  In 1895, when Picasso was a teenager, his younger sister died from diphtheria. After this traumatic event (that would also influence his later work), the rest of the family moved to Barcelona. Pablo had his first exhibition when he turned 13 and it was in the back room of an umbrella store. His artistic progress can be seen at the Museu Picasso in Barcelona as a collection of early works that provides one of the most comprehensive records of any major artist's beginnings. At the time, Pablo’s father worked at the La Llotja School of Fine Arts where he persuaded the officials to let young Pablo take an entrance exam. Only 13 years old, Pablo surprised the entire board by doing more than well on the exam and he was enthusiastically admitted into the school, taking the advanced classes in classical art and still life. It was there where Pablo’s first major painting was painted – his first ""academic"" painting is titled First Communion, featuring a portrait of his father, mother, and younger sister kneeling before an altar. Picasso was only 15 when he finished it. The painting was exhibited at the Third Exhibition of Fine Arts and Artistic Industries in 1896 in Barcelona and attracted the attention of the local press. His second large oil painting, Science and Charity, won a gold medal.   Pablo Picasso continued his art education at the Royal Academy of San Fernando in Madrid just to get back to Barcelona after less than a year to enroll in the School of Fine Arts. The students in Madrid drew from plaster casts and copied works of the old masters - something that was not enough for a talented genius Picasso with his rebellious behavior, long hair, and strange clothes. Regardless of his nature and appearance, while working with live models and plaster casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, Picasso displayed a well-developed and precise skill over the academic draftsmanship (best seen in his Study of a Torso from 1893-94), one that is notable throughout his career and that served as a base for more original work.   In 1898, when he came back to Barcelona, he got down with scarlet fever. What followed his illness was his first, Modernist period, considered to have spanned between 1899 and 1900. Notable by his classicism and realism becoming enriched with the influence of Symbolism, it was best expressed through a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. Picasso rejected the academic study and changed his artistic direction by joining the circle of young avant-garde artists and writers (modernistes and decadentes) who gathered at a local tavern, Els Quatre Gats. Adopting this new modern style, Picasso produced numerous portraits of friends and acquaintances from Els Quatre Gats, among them Carles Casagemas and Jaime Sabartès. The work of Rossetti, Edvard Munch, Toulouse-Lautrec and Steinlen, combined with Picasso’s fascination with his favorite old master El Greco, led him to create works resembling modernism that he instilled with a nuance of his own. Illustrating and overcoming, in a way, the issues existing in modernist art, they represent a necessary step towards abstraction that Picasso also implemented in other areas of his work.   In 1900, Picasso had left for Paris - the center of the art world where he opened a studio in Montmartre. It was then that he decided to stop signing his work with his name Ruiz Blasco and decided to use his mother’s name, thus being known as Pablo Picasso. In the beginning of his days in Paris, he met his first Parisian friend, Max Jacob, a poet and journalist who helped him learn the language and its literature. Soon, his circle of friends included Guillaume Apollinaire, Gertrude and Leo Stein, as well as two dealers, Ambroise Vollard and Berthe Weill. They called themselves La Banda Picasso, and together they were pushing the boundaries of traditional art and stylistic experimentation - one could say of contemporary culture in general. Between 1900 and 1901, his work reflected a variety of new styles and techniques - like the introduction of bright, unmixed colors. Works from this period mirror the influence of post-impressionist painters such as Van Gogh, Cézanne, Seurat, and Gauguin. Picasso was depicting typical scenes of Parisian nightlife: dance hall Le Moulin de la Galette and portraits, such as a poster-like image of Pere Mañach, an art dealer who promoted Picasso's work at the time.   Following the 1901 suicide of his best friend and fellow painter Carlos Casagemas from Els Quatre Gats with whom he moved to Paris, he entered his Blue Period. It is characterized by essentially monochromatic paintings in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colors. Haunted by nostalgic feeling about his friend and their homeland, all of these paintings are inspired by Spain. In 1903, when he produced most of his Blue works, Picasso experienced relative poverty and instability and it influenced his work as he was depicting beggars, street urchins, the old and frail and the blind. Sad truth is that during that time Picasso even had to burn many of his paintings to stay warm! One of the paintings from this era, The Blue Room from 1901, hides another painting beneath. Due to the poverty or discontent with a work, a bow-tied man with his face resting on his hand is forever lost; or saved, depending on perspective. In 2014, scientists and art experts have used advances in infrared imagery to reveal the hidden painting. The Blind Man's Meal painted in Barcelona in the autumn of 1903 summarizes the stylistic characteristics of Picasso's Blue Period, together with one of his most renowned  paintings: The Old Guitarist. Both of them are more than mere portraits of a blind man or old, sad guitarist - they are also Picasso's commentary on human suffering in general. At the time when The Old Guitarist was created, the literature of the Symbolist movement often included blind characters that possessed powers of inner vision. For three years (1901-1904), he painted as if he was viewing the world through cold blue spectacles. The choice of this color was not accidental - it was associated with representations of melancholy or despair. Before him, no other artist had ever done this.   By 1905, his style had evolved from the Blue to the Rose Period. Although the first is generally more popular, the Rose period holds a more important position in relation to art and history as it presented distinct aspects of style that came to be unmistakably tied to Picasso. As the Blue one, this period’s color also coincides with the personal, internal state of artist’s emotions - the time of increased personal joy and romance as Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a French artist and model who became his muse and mistress. It is said that their relationship is the main reason he changed his somber color pallet and subject matter. Almost instantly, the pallet of red, pink, and orange hues appeared as well as a subtle use of line, idealized forms, and more spirited subjects, such as circus performers, as he began to convey these saltimbanques and harlequins within his works. Showing them in most of his pieces - paintings, gouaches, drawings, and prints - Picasso tended to depict these circus performers at rest, often in isolation or in the presence of fellow performers. A comedic harlequin character depicted in checkered patterned clothing even became a personal symbol for Picasso. In the spring of 1904, he finally settled in Paris, moving into a tumbledown residence in Montmartre known as the Bateau Lavoir, named for its resemblance to a laundry barge.   Another significant woman in Picasso’s life was Gertrude Stein, an American writer of novels, poetry and plays as well as a collector, a muse and a phenomenon. By 1905, Picasso became a favorite of Stein and her brother Leo. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. The first work by Picasso that the Steins acquired was Harlequin's Family with an Ape. The Stein family, especially Gertrude, became Picasso's principal patrons acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in Gertrude’s informal Salon in Paris. It was there where Picasso met Henri Matisse who became his lifelong friend and a rival at the same time. Eventually, Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso. In 2003, a blockbuster show about the Matisse-Picasso relationship opened at New York’s MOMA. The exhibition explored how each man’s genius influenced and pushed the other man’s practice in a cycle of rivalry and partnership.   The pivotal artwork Les Demoiselles d’Avignon from 1907 announced a brand new phase - Cubism. Even though there is an assumption that the artist never felt Les Demoiselles d’Avignon to be finished and kept the work rolled up under his bed until he sold it in the 1920s to the collector, fashion designer, Jacques Doucet - this work is considered as the very beginning of Cubism. To be more accurate, it was the beginning of the so-called Proto-Cubism (1907-1910), the early formative period that includes Les Demoiselles d’Avignon and Braque’s reaction to the painting, Grand Nu.   From 1906 to 1909 Picasso painted in a style strongly influenced by African sculptures and particularly the traditional African masks brought to Paris museums in consequence of the expansion of the French empire into Sub-Saharan Africa. While visiting African art section at the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro, Picasso experienced a revelation, as he said. This Proto-Cubism phase is called the African Period, Negro Period, or simply the Black Period. It started with a painting Les Demoiselles d’Avignon where the two figures on the right are clearly the very beginnings of Picasso’s Proto-Cubism. Since 1909, Picasso began creating Cubist Sculptures in a technique he kept using throughout his career. His first cubist sculpture was the bronze bust of Fernande Olivier titled Head of a Woman. He also made constructions from odds and ends of wood, metal, paper, and non-artistic materials.   In 1911, one mysterious event cast a shadow on a friendship Picasso had with Apollinaire ever since La Banda Picasso days. Guillaume Apollinaire was arrested on suspicion of stealing the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. The thief turned out to be a bisexual con man named Honoré Joseph Géry Pieret, a secretary of Apollinaire. It was him that had implicated Apollinaire in the thefts in the first place. Four years earlier, Picasso had bought from Pieret two stolen sculptures, Roman-era Iberian heads from Louvre, so Apollinaire pointed the finger at Picasso who was brought in for questioning. However, prosecutors couldn't build a case that either Picasso or Apollinaire had stolen the heads, much less the Mona Lisa, and both of them were set free.  Picasso and Braque worked together closely during the next few years (1909 - 12), which was the only time Picasso ever worked with another painter in this way, and they developed what came to be known as Analytical Cubism. Analytical Cubism is a branch of Cubism developed between 1908 and 1912 in which artists ""analyzed"" natural compositions and reduced the forms into basic geometric parts on the two-dimensional picture plane. A monochromatic scheme was used, often including gray, blue and ochre. In 1912, Synthetic Cubism phase started when Picasso began pasting paper and pieces of oilcloth to his paintings, painting either on them or around them. His collage work came to the throne and Picasso just kept using this technique all throughout his career, although never exclusively. In collage, Picasso abandoned the idea of the picture as a window on objects in the world and began to think of it merely as an array of signs that used different, sometimes metaphorical means, to refer to those objects. This phase was much more decorative and colorful in style than others; even though shapes remained fragmented and flat. Later on, somewhere between 1915 and 1917, Picasso created a series of paintings of highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects - a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. This phase was titled Crystal Cubism, due to one letter Picasso wrote to Gertrude Stein calling them little gems, hard-edged square-cut diamonds. Picasso might have created those little gems as a response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, because of his experimentation with classicism within the so-called return to order (Retour à l'ordre) after the war. It was a European art movement that emerged as a reaction to the War and it was rejecting the extreme avant-garde art while taking its inspiration from the traditional art source instead. This return to order is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, and Jean Metzinger. After Cubism, Picasso went on to embrace a more Classical style in his paintings, drawing and sculpture and this period is known as his Classicist period. However, he would keep coming back to cubism from time to time.   Picasso’s collaboration with the Russian Ballet began in 1917. In the 1920s, he worked on the décor for Stravinsky’s ballet Pulcinella. Picasso also started creating neoclassical paintings of women and paintings inspired by Greek mythology alongside some strange pictures of small-headed bathers and violent convulsive portraits of women - often thought to have indicated the tension he was experiencing in his marriage. After 1927, his work became more and more fantastic and visionary. Woman with Flower from 1932 is a distorted and deformed portrait of Marie-Thérèse done in the manner of Surrealism that was growing in strength at the time.   Bringing together the symbols of horse and bull that are highly valued in Spanish culture, Picasso created perhaps one of his most popular works - the Guernica, his most powerful political statement, painted as an immediate reaction to the Nazi's devastating casual bombing practice on the Basque town of Guernica during Spanish Civil War. He chose to paint the Guernica in various shades of white, gray, and black, leaving enough room for the narrative to dominate the piece. Once, when asked by Gestapo officer who was pointing at the photo of this piece during the search of his apartment, ""Did you do that?"" Picasso answered: ""No. You did."" It was the government of the Spanish Republic that acquired the mural for Guernica from Picasso to be part of the Spanish Pavilion at the International Exposition in Paris in 1937. Two years earlier, in 1935, Picasso had done the etching Minotauromaquia, Guernica’s most direct relative. It brings together all of the symbols that Picasso had been portraying in the cycle dedicated to the mythological creature, condensing them into a single artwork.   During the WWII, Picasso stayed in Paris even though the Germans occupied the city. He did not exhibit during this time but he did not quit painting, and some of the works made in this period include Still Life with Guitar from 1942 or The Charnel House 1944–45. As for his sculptures at the time - even though the bronze was forbidden by Nazis, Picasso managed to keep getting it from the French Resistance so he continued to create. Picasso started writing his poetry in this period. He wrote more than 300 poems until the 1960s.  At the end of the 1940s, Picasso started creating ceramic works. He was inspired by the clarity of the light and the bright Mediterranean colors while he spent his summers on the Cote d'Azur, South of France. Picasso visited Vallauris for the annual pottery exhibition in 1946 where he met the owners of Madoura ceramics. Madoura works fascinated him so much that Picasso made an arrangement with the owners Suzanne and Georges Ramié: they gave him access to all the tools and resources he needed to express his creativity with ceramics, and in exchange, the Ramié family would produce and sell his ceramic work. This collaboration with the local ceramicists spanned 25 years.  Picasso's style had changed once again in the 50s. He started producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. Maybe the most famous is a series of works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas. Paintings from this period are based on works of Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix. Eugène Delacroix’s Women of Algiers in their Apartment became an obsession for Picasso. In 1954, he began the first of 15 oil paintings and hundreds of sketches that would make up his Women of Algiers, Versions A through O. The last was completed on Valentine's Day 1955. By that year, Picasso had settled in the south of France, and would return to Paris only once more before his death. Women held a special place in his life and his art. “Women are machines for suffering,” Picasso told once to his mistress Françoise Gilot in 1943. He had two wives (Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina from the Ballet Russes and Jacqueline Roque) and four children by three women. The list of Picasso’s women is long: his first long-term relationship was with the model Fernande Olivier, who was at the same time the subject of many of Picasso's Rose Period paintings; Eva Gouel received quite a bit of attention in his work; Dora Maar, a painter and photographer, documented his Guernica painting, and other notable women of that time left an impact on his life and practice.   An architect who created Daley Center in Chicago asked Picasso to make a sculpture by writing him a poem! Picasso was 82 years old at the time and he was living on the French Riviera. Before his sculpture - the public artwork in Chicago mainly depicted historical figures. Picasso worked on Chicago commission for two whole years. Tete (Maquette pour la sculpture en plein air du Chicago Civic Center) is one of two iron and sheet metal maquettes that Picasso created between 1962 and 1964. One was sent as the model for Daley Center sculpture. In 1967, the design was enlarged and cast in welded iron and on the 15th August that year the final work was unveiled in the plaza outside the Civic Center building in Chicago. In 2013, Tete maquete was sold for 8,885,000 GBP at Sotheby’s. This first monumental outdoor Picasso in North America was an unpainted, three-dimensional, cubist sculpture standing 50 feet tall and weighing 162 tons, made of Corrosive Tensile (""Cor-Ten"") steel, the same material used to build the Daley Center. For this mysterious statue (it is still uncertain whether it depicts a bird, a woman or a horse) Picasso refused to collect $100,000, donating it to the people of the city. Picasso's final works were a mixture of styles, he became more daring while his works more colorful and expressive. From 1968 through 1971 Picasso had produced many paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings. The public and even some critics saw his work of that time as banal pornographic fantasies of an old man who was past his prime. However, after Picasso's death, the critical community realized that Picasso had already discovered neo-expressionism and was, as so often before, ahead of his time. Pablo Picasso had a 78-year long career; he left behind 13,500 paintings, 100,000 prints and engravings, and 34,000 illustrations. He also produced 300 sculptures and ceramic pieces. More than 350 pieces which he created during his career have been stolen.   With so many brilliant artworks made spanning across so many different directions and styles that he helped create, Pablo Picasso did more than just mark an era - he forged and directed the path for future generations. Ahead of his time in so many fields, his name is today known even among those that are no fans of art, which speaks of the weight of his influence and legacy. He truly was a one of a kind, and we are lucky that he saw it so fitting to produce as much as he did. Pablo Picasso died on April 8th, 1973 in Mougins, France, leaving behind a rich oeuvre that will dictate the quality in the art world for a long time.   ",31

Javier Rey," Colombian photographer Javier Ray creates artworks that explore the sensuality of the male body and the repeated elements of urban cities. Born in 1991, he studies graphic design at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Ray published his first series of photographs titled Then the sun comes through the window, after finishing high school. Since then, his artworks have been featured in several art fairs, such as La Feria Del Millón (Colombia), ArtLima (Peru), and Scope Art Fair (Miami), as well as a number of collective exhibitions. In 2015 the artist was named one of 145 most relevant artists on the web.     Since an early age, the Javier Ray has expressed interest in photography and has secretly used his father's camera to take photos. At 18, just after finishing high school, he exhibited his photographs for the first time in the PechaKucha Night BGA initiative. The artist's first solo exhibition was in 2018 at Permanente Gallery. In 2015 Greek-based collective Atopos was the first to praised his artistic eye by including his artworks in the book titled Unlocked. Since then, his photographs have featured in publications all over the world, from the USA to Colombia, Germany, Denmark, Spain, to name a few.     In his photographs, Ray explores the correlation between gender and the masculine body. His subjects, stripped of any clues to their identity, have become sculptures that emphasize male sexuality. Whether it is a body lost in the vastness of nature's landscape or submerged underwater, the direct sensuality is ever-present. The artist has an unprecedented eye for small details that put into focus the beauty and strength of masculinity. He illuminates the love between men without public shame or reservation in his series El Mundo Atónito (The World Thunderstruck).  In Abismarse (Engulfment), Javier Rey takes a look at the darker side of the mind and the fear of the abyss. The body is lost in the darkness, but the fear disappears, for it has become part of it, and they are one. Finally, in the series titled All the voluptuousness of the earth (All The Delights Of The Earth), the body emerges into existence full of exhilaration and joy.        Against the backdrop of cloudless blue sky, Ray often takes photos of buildings, accentuating their fragility. They are monumental sculptures that float separated from the rest, above the pollution of the city. Humanity's constant search for unattainable perfection through better, bigger, modern cities is presented as a castle of glass. The buildings featured in series Espejismos (Mirages) are standing as a bridge between the natural world and the artifactual. With both subjects, the buildings and male bodies, Ray is willing to explore places deep within himself that are so often left in the dark.  Javier Ray lives and works in Bogota, Columbia.      ",37
Mel Ramos,"Mel Ramos was an American artist best known for his provocative yet humorous paintings and prints inspired by Pop-Art and Pin-Up style. Ramos mixed the imagery of idealized nude women with popular, ubiquitous items such as Coca Cola bottles and movie posters. From the 1960s onward, Mel Ramos was inspired by various voluptuous celebrities, from Marylin Monroe to nowadays star Scarlett Johansson. His style is based on the sensuality typical for Playboy materials as well as the appropriation of the imagery from mass media and consumer products. Ramos’ paintings are based on surrealism and absurd connections between unrelated objects.  Mel Ramos was born in 1935 in Sacramento, in a Portuguese-Azorean immigrant family. He was a figurative painter specialized in the creation of luscious female nudes. Even though his work is clearly figurative, it also incorporates various elements of abstract art. Mel Ramos started to gain his popularity during the expansion of the pop art movement in the 60s. At the time, he was creating prevalently images of popular superheroes and gradually started to include female nudes emerging from bizarre objects, such as cornstalks, bananas, candy wrappers, martini glasses or famous cigar and cigarette brands such as Havana. The nudes and objects that Ramos depicted are usually bathed in cool neon lights, which is typical for this specific type of pop art. In pieces like Butterfinger from 1995 and Miss Lucky Lulu from 1965, Ramos coupled youthful, ironically perfect female bodies with American candy bars, cigarettes, and other branded items. His pieces are well-known for exploring the ways in which modern American and Europea culture has cast the female body as interchangeable with beauty and consumerism. He also superimposed his trademark females on famous nudes from art history and classical mythology. When it comes to his education and academic career, Ramos went to Sacramento Junior College and San Jose State College. One of his art teachers and mentors was the famous Wayne Thiebaud, whose work strongly influenced Mel Ramos. The artist graduated in 1958 - he received his B.A. and M.A. from Sacramento State College. From 1958 to 1966, he became a teacher himself and taught art courses at Elk Grove High School and Mira Loma High School in Sacramento.   After he finished his early teaching assignments, Ramos began a career at California State University, which enriched his biography a lot. He also worked at the same university as Professor Emeritus. Mel Ramos started to gain recognition since the early 70s and until today he participated in roughly 120 group shows. Together with legendary pop artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, Ramos was one of the first artistic figures who based his painting on the images from comic books. Warhol, Lichtenstein and Ramos have exhibited their pieces together at the Los Angeles County Museum in 1963, which was a tremendous success. Later on, Ramos started collaborating with his mentor Wayne Thiebaud and produced prominent artworks that celebrated humorous aspects of popular culture and mass media. Ramos is represented by a number of influential galleries, such as the Louis K. Meisel since 1971, San Francisco's Modernism and Galerie Ernst Hilger in Austria. When it comes to his most recent exhibitions, a major solo show was held at the Albertina in Vienna in 2011 and a large museum retrospective of his work opened at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, in 2012. This show is considered Ramos’ first major museum exhibition held in his home town in the last three decades. Ramos's work isn’t thematically uniform and during his long career; he was incorporating new elements to his art every now and then. For instance, from 1972 until his death, he worked on a series of prints inspired by famous nude paintings and prints by artists such as Willem de Kooning and Amedeo Modigliani. He also started experimenting with landscapes and self-portraits since the mid-80s.   Mel Ramos’ seductive works have been shown in many major exhibitions of pop and pin-up art across the United States and Europe. His pieces have been regularly reproduced in numerous books, catalogs, and periodicals as well. Even though Wayne Thiebaud had an important influence on Ramos’ work, the artist’s rich imagination helped him built his very own artistic style. In the 60s, he started using the motifs of pin-up girls much more frequently, which contributed to his fame and popularity. In a nutshell, the art of Mel Ramos represents an ironic reaction to the cliches we often see in the advertising industry and in the mass media. Mel Ramos died in October 2018 at age 83. According to his daughter and studio manager, Rochelle Leininger, the cause of death was heart failure. ",38

Ricky Cohete,"Self-taught photographer Ricky Cohete is a rising star in the fashion world. The artist perfectly captures the statuesque beauty of the male bodies. Born in Ecuador, most of his life, he spent in Miami, the city of lights, colors, and warm weather. These things are what drew him toward photography. Cohete is a versatile artist that also creates music, poetry, drawings, short films, and his own brand of t-shirts. Throughout his career, he also published several photography books, such as Men & Palm Tree and AZUL.    Born Ricardo Delgado in 1986, Ricky never had formal training. He wanted to study filmmaking however, he soon realized that he could do it on his own. After just one semester, instead of wasting time being bored, he decided to drop out. After moving to Miami, Cohete soon started working for Telemundo. Here he got the unique opportunity to direct music videos. Photography was just something he stumbled on and decided to try it out. As Ricky says: “I had a camera in my hands, and I was fascinated.” Miami light became perfect for a photographer who did not wish to work inside a studio. Its refined and crisp quality was just the type of lighting that gives such ethereal quality to his photographs. By avoiding the safe space of a studio, the timing was everything, and there was not enough time for rehearsals. The results are creative compositions that have a unique balance of color, light, and shadow.    Cohete started out photographing ballet dancers in Miami. However, as time went by he slowly shifted to the male form. The artist draws inspiration from astrology and tarot culture, and a lot of these elements can be seen throughout his oeuvre. However, he always avoids labeling his work, and in that way, limiting it. Cohete strongly believes that his art should stand by itself and speak for itself without unnecessary explanations. Cohete creates photographic series that are often inspired by the nature and past. For example, in The Alignment series (2018), his subjects are two ballet dancers underwater. Here the artist mixes two themes, images from the 16th century and the element of water that is the source of all life and rebirth.    Besides occasionally recording songs for the band Cohete Rocket, the artist has also directed their music video. Also, he is a designer and the general editor of the online magazine Dexter. Every two months a new issue comes out featuring a perfect blend of art, fashion, music, and photography. In addition, Cohete has also published a photography book titled Bianco that also includes sketches and short poems by the author.  Ricky Cohete lives and works in Miami, Florida.   ",43

Josef Albers,"Josef Albers was a renowned German abstract painter and color theorist, one of the most prominent and influential pioneers of 20th-century modernism, who dedicated a great deal of his life to art – either teaching it or producing it. He is best known for his series of paintings titled Homage to the Square, where he praises the strict form and patterns, and the powerful nature of colors. He was one of the most important persons in laying the foundation of European Modernism, particularly those close to the Bauhaus. His extensive theoretical work that was based on contentions that color, rather than form, is the primary medium of pictorial language, directed development of modern art during the 1950’s and 1960’s in the United States.   Josef Albers was born in Bottrop, Germany, in 1888 to Roman Catholic parents. Albers started his highly successful career as an art teacher in 1908. Initially, he worked in Bottrop until 1913, when he moved to Berlin to study and further train as a teacher at Königliche Kunstschule for two years. A year later, he moved to Essen, and in 1918 he did his first commissioned work Rosa mystica ora pro nobis, which was a window of a church in Essen, made of stained-glass. The following year was the beginning of his development as an artist, as he moved to Munich to study at the Königliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst. He there received his education and training from some of Germany’s most eminent painters and art theorists such as Franz Stuck and Max Doerner. It could be said that the year of 1920 was Albers’ milestone, as he moved to Weimar to study at the Bauhaus, a renowned German art school. He took up a course of Johannes Itten, a Swiss expressionist painter. Despite having studied painting, he became a faculty member in 1922 as a stained glass maker. A year later, he was offered a position to teach a new preliminary course “Werklehre” by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus founder, and director. Since Albers had been raised by parents who had been working with handicrafts, and since he had the knowledge and skill needed, he was the perfect candidate for that position. The Bauhaus was moved to Dessau in 1925, and Albers moved with it, getting tenure there. Some of his many co-workers were world’s most renowned artists, such as Paul Klee (with whom he had worked for several years), Oskar Schlemmer and Wassily Kandinsky. One of his students was Anni Fleischmann, who would later become his wife. In this period, he still continued to work with stained glass and started designing furniture and objects of utility.  The rise of the Nazi regime in Germany resulted in the shut-down of the Bauhaus in 1933, and a majority of artists had fled, Albers included. He went to the US, where he was immediately given a job at Black Mountain College, a newly opened art school in North Carolina. He was the head of the painting program for 16 years when he resigned in 1949. Albers taught many students there, who would later prove to be hugely successful artists, like Cy Twombly and Robert Rauschenberg. During the time he spent at Black Mountain, he made numerous woodcuts and leaf studies. In 1950, Albers moved to Connecticut, where he started working at Yale University as the chairman of the Department of Design. For the next eight years, a number of highly acclaimed artists learned from Albers, such as Neil Welliver and Eva Hesse. It was in 1958 that Josef Albers decided to permanently retire from teaching. He did, however, remain a fellow at Yale, continuing to closely work and cooperate with them. In 1962, he was awarded a grant, provided by the Graham Foundation, for a lecture and an exhibit of his rich body of work. He also worked with King-lui Wu, an architect and a professor at Yale, helping him create designs for some of his projects. Around this time, he started working on his Structural Constellations, a series he was still developing at the time of his death. In 1973, Josef Albers became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science.  Josef Albers belonged to the group of artists who created in geometric abstraction movement. The strict geometric form and patterns are clearly visible in his works. Albers brought several elements from both European and American art into his work. The influence of the Europe’s Constructivists and Bauhaus movements exists in his works – the energy and tension of colors, and the small scales – but he leaned heavily on the new American art of the 1950’s and 1960’s. Behind many of his works, a list of colors and varnishes can be found. Those were all the elements he used when creating, in an attempt to catalog and “record” them. The plays of color intensity and vibrancy of forms and patterns in Albers’ paintings have influenced a great number of artists. Painters who created hard-edge abstract art draw from the tension and sharpness of his colors and patterns. Albers is often cited as an artist who had contributed a lot to the development of several movements in art, such as Minimalist, Conceptual, and Op art. Interaction of Color was Albers’ book about the color theory, published by Yale University Press in 1963, that was conceived as a handbook and a sort of guide for artists. This unique masterpiece soon became the most popular and influential book about the theory of colors – their intensity, temperature, and relative and delusive nature. In it, Albers theorizes that it is the inner logic that has control over colors. This was also the period when he designed a number of album covers for musicians like Terry Snyder and Enoch Light.  Homage to the Square is a notable series of hundreds of abstract paintings that Albers started creating around 1950. Albers greatly respected composition and with this series, he experimented with squares planted within one another, and the nature of their interactions. The paintings usually consist of three or four squares of different dimensions and formats painted using a palette knife on a piece of Masonite hardboard. A few paintings from the series are estimated to be worth around half a million dollars, but some of them have surpassed their initial price estimate, reaching the exorbitant amount of over 1.5 million dollars. One such painting is Joy from 1964, sold at Sotheby’s auction in 2007. Unlike Homage to the Square, Structural Constellation focuses on form, rather than color. It is a series of reliefs and engravings which Josef Albers began creating around the same time as Homage to the Square, and like the series of paintings had not stopped creating until his death. The main idea Albers explores is the visual uncertainty; he wants his viewers to “open their eyes”. Seemingly convoluted geometric shapes that appear to be impossible to exist in our three-dimensional realm, force us to catch the understanding of them.  Albers also created a number of murals, which adorn walls of building throughout cities in the US. Two Structural Constellations can be found in the lobby of the Corning Glass Building in New York City. Inspired by the series of the same name, the mural made of gold-leaf was designed in 1959. Albers continued doing commissioned murals in New York. The huge Two Portals is located in the lobby of the Time & Life Building, in Rockefeller Center. The white and brown glass lines, with two bronze centers, give off the impression of false depth. The MetLife Building (at the time known as Pan Am Building) was constructed by Walter Gropius, and he invited Albers to create a mural for it. Albers re-designed his City from 1929 (the construction he did at the Bauhaus) and gave it a new name: Manhattan. Unfortunately, the mural was relocated around 2000 due to the reconstruction of the building’s lobby. Other murals Josef did include Growth and Loggia Wall (both of which were painted in 1967 for the Rochester Institute of Technology), and Gemini (1972, located in Kansas City). Australia is another country where one of his murals is located: he made his Wrestling in 1976 in Sydney for Seidler’s Mutual Life Center upon his former student’s request.  Josef Albers, together with his wife Anni, who was a textile artist, writer, and printmaker, established a non-profit organization in 1971. Initially, their mission was to promote and deepen the vision of art. Today, however, the organization is dedicated to promoting and perpetuating the couple’s legacy and artistic principles of their lives. The foundation supports the artists whose artistic expression was shaped by Anni and Josef by organizing and sponsoring exhibitions, promotions, and publications. It also has the biggest archive of the Albers’ works. They are based in Bethany in Connecticut, US. Several museums have held retrospective exhibitions of Albers’ work, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and in Paris at the Centre Pompidou. In 1983, a museum in Josef’s native town, Bottrop, was opened, dedicated to his life and work. For the greatest part of his life, Josef Albers lived and worked in New Haven, Connecticut, with his wife, until his death in 1976. His art and theories were widely excepted and applied among the generations of artists and art schools that enabled basis for the development of non-objective art from Abstract Expressionism onwards. Transforming the art education and pedagogy by creating a non-dogmatic, un-hierarchical, scientific approach based on observation and experimentation, he invented the methods that became accepted part of the academic training of visual artists.

Thomas Ruff,"Internationally acclaimed for his explorations of photography, Thomas Ruff is best known through his serial works, portraits and digital images. Ruff’s series of photographs of interiors of German rooms received first critical attention, in the past.  During the 1980s the artist created large-scale works in color, displaying building facades and printing them in monumental sizes, changing the outlook on architecture. Thomas is well known for his somber portraits of friends that have a unique aesthetics of police photographs from the 1970s. Although he is undoubtedly a talented photographer, it is what he does to photographs that mark his work apart.   Having studied photography at the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, alongside famous photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher, Thomas’ chosen medium is photography. Still, one is inclined to say he is a digital artist not merely a photographer. His experiments with altered and appropriated imagery make him recognizable. He would borrow material from a variety of sources, such as newspapers, textbooks, comics, images on the internet, pornography and his old photographed works. Thomas’ opus offers more than taking photos, as he might use digital manipulation for one piece and antiquated darkroom technique for another. The artist’s series are divided by the most seemingly incompatible categories. His bodies of work include empty domestic interiors, appropriated interplanetary images captured by NASA, computer-generated pop imagery, obscured pornography and abstractions of modernist architecture.    In the early 1980s, Ruff’s series of portraits was the first to receive critical acclaim. This series featured groupings of large-scale three-quarter portraits. The kind resembling a passport or a police photo. The startling level of legibility these photos gained, came through their enlarged scale. Despite Thomas’ continuous disavowal of any sociocultural reading of his art, this series seems to beg for such an interpretation. And it is not the only one, as many other photographic series of his induce cultural discourse. However, the artist focuses on aesthetics and process, his opus is eclectic and not defined by genre, theme or method. It is rather his stark imagery, the relative conceptualization of the subject and the subversion of the printed image that characterize Ruff’s work.    There is a good reason why Thomas Ruff is acknowledged as a leading innovator among German artists who launched photography into mainstream art. His photography has never been conservative and rule abiding, but open and explorative. Many genres of photography, such as architectural, astrological, portrait and pornographic, have received new perspectives, thanks to Ruff’s means. The artist’s exhibition Photograms and Negatives pulls the spectator in an ocean of colors – blues and greens. Diving through these incredible works of art evokes a new sensation. The pieces framed in glass, reflect the viewer and everything that is happening in the gallery, thus giving the feeling as if it was all a part of the exhibition. Done intentionally or not, this extraordinary perception makes everything and everyone a part of the process, collaborating with the artist’s current work. As Ruff himself says, making photograms is indeed abstract photography, having only shadows with no real objects – what a perfect metaphor of Plato’s cave.    Born in 1958 in Zell am Harmersbach, Germany, the artist attended Staatliche Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf from 1977 to 1985. He was a professor here from 2000 to 2006. His artworks are well known all around the world, and his public collections include Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Museum of Modern Art in New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Tate Gallery, London; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris. Thomas Ruff was a pioneer of photography as we know it today, and he keeps surprising the audience with his new ideas and extraordinary talent.    ",47
Raymond Hendler,"A Philadelphia-born action painter, Raymond Hendler is best known for animated yet simple compositions characterized by a joyful exuberance expressed through sensuous black lines and both geometric and amorphous shapes. Over the years, his work evolved from overall tightly wound linear webs to abstract pictograms that blend a personal language with hints at figuration. Hendler began his career as Abstract Expressionist in Paris as early as 1949. Immersing himself in the Left Bank art scene, he formed close friendships with the Canadian painter Jean Paul Riopelle and the noted Australian sculptor Robert Klippel. He credited Kipple with support at a crucial moment that led to a career-defining breakthrough - an activity that involved the use of the automatic and the unconscious. Returning to New York in 1951, he became active in the burgeoning New York art scene, being the youngest voting member of the New York Artist’s Club. Deeply spiritual at its source, his art had common roots in the use of the automatic and the unconscious, coupled with his concept of ""further choice"" and a commitment to a hard edge. His canvases are made up of lines, colorful right angles, and floating cartouches, which occasionally create picture environments that resemble gardens, skies, or artist’s studios.

Margaret Morrison,"Margaret Morrison is an American artist and art professor, best known for her paintings which fuse together still life, elements from figurative art and subjects of surrealism. She is also known for her realistic paintings of brightly-colored candies and toys. Critically acclaimed, her works were featured in numerous publications and on television.  The youngest of six daughters, Margaret was born on January 21, 1960, in Utah. She received her training from the University of Utah, graduating in 1981 when she obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Seven years later, in 1988, she got her Master of Fine Arts degree from the same institution. During her developmental years, the artist resided in the Philippines and had visited numerous countries in Europe and the Orient in search of inspiration. Since 1995, she has been represented by Woodward Gallery in New York, and the majority of her shows, both one-person and group, were organized by them. She currently works as a professor at the Lamar Dodd School of Art, at the University of Georgia, where she teaches painting and drawing.  A man in a ghostly white lab coat is a recurrent subject of her figurative paintings. Morrison depicts many levels of flight allegories because she sees flight as the ultimate metaphor for life – a metaphor that is encoded into this mysterious white man. Over the years, the characters in her paintings grew up, delving into their natures and trying to understand what lies ahead. The white lab coat became a symbol of self-awareness. In her work called Patron Saints and Rituals from 2005, she included her first encounters with the history of art. These paintings perfectly capture the world where religious symbols, ancient rituals and the worries of the modern world are intertwined.  In 2008, the artist was diagnosed with cancer. The fact that she knew her life was endangered, made her change the subjects of her paintings. She substituted the somber and gloomy palette with bright and cheerful colors. In 2009, she dedicated an exhibition to life. Larger Than Life was held at Woodward Gallery. The imagery she chose served her as both psychological and physical therapy. Large-scale paintings depicted Twinkies, Gummy worms, cupcakes and other sugary delights. The Utah-born artist combines liquid with her paint, resulting in a seamless series of hidden brush strokes; eventually utilizing a glazing process which achieves and effect that takes realism a step further. It’s almost as if the viewer is experiencing a high definition medium. From afar, her paintings don’t appear as paintings but form up-close, intentional, obvious brush strokes add highlights and depth. Managing to capture this illusion is what sets the artist apart from many other realists. The works are multi-dimensional, revealing more subtleties the more one views. Her innovative use of light schemes lights up the surroundings. Shadows are rendered through the translucent nature of the gummy worms, so these shadows are multicolored mirror images. A master of the translucent, her painting Candy Jar amazes in the way the light hits the Mason jar and how the glass morphs the candies.   The 2012 exhibition titled Child’s Play, organized by Woodward Gallery, was another success for the artist. In it, the Georgia-based artist presented her paintings which described every child’s world of imagination, with huge toys, enormous robots and life-sized dolls. This was her second series of larger than life, color-exploding paintings. This series accentuates the artist’s ability and skill to inhale life and stories in her still life images. The stories are the same as they were when we were children, except this time, we see them differently, through the prism of our adult experiences.  Best known for her detailed still-life and surreal figurative paintings often depicting sweet treats and toys that send our mind back to childhood, Morrison’s figurative imagery is expertly lit to invoke a foreshadowing element to the composition. In recent years, she created a number of paintings that present driver’s point of view and the act of driving a car a sort of meditation. With their atmosphere of sunset, Morrison’s highways are a vacation for the weary mind, body and soul.   ",49
Robert Indiana,"Robert Indiana was a prominent American artist, who rose to fame in the 60's, and played a major role in Pop Art, hard-edge painting, usage of bold and bright elements and expansion of assemblage art. He used to describe his own work as painting of signs, as he liked to explore the contextual power of words, their meaning, and reference. Indiana explored literature, fiction, searched for great American writings, and founded valuable legacy that shaped the nature of contemporary art. Many other creatives followed his path and used words as central symbols and subjects in their art. The most famous piece he made is the LOVE paintings, which became so popular, that Indiana later claimed it was too popular. He wanted to make exclusive artwork, and even though he was proud of the Love series, he wanted to distinguish himself from Pop Art and later in career addressed social and political issues.  Robert Indiana was born as Robert Clack in New Castle, Indiana, in 1928. He was adopted by loving family when he was just a baby and spent most of his childhood years moving throughout the country. He started showing artistic inclinations at an early age, and luckily enough his elementary school teacher noticed that. When he was only a first-grader he started drawing and telling everyone he wanted a career in art. In 1942, Robert Indiana moved to Indianapolis to attend Arsenal Technical High School, which was the best possible option for him at the time, giving that his major talent required serious education, and his good grades got him a place at this prestigious school, known for quite advanced curriculum. After graduation Robert Indiana joined the US Air Force, and then made one of the best decisions in his career, to study at the Art Institute of Chicago.  His rich formal education continued at the Skowhegan School of Sculpture and Painting in Maine, and later in Europe at the Edinburgh College of Art in Scotland. After completing education, he moved to New York in 1956 to join a community of creatives who were open-minded enough for him, and willing to explore and evolve. Some of them were loving lady of minimalism Agnes Martin, James Rosenquist and Jack Youngerman. Indiana lived in the neighborhood called Slip, that was a big port, full of plants, trees, and beautiful colors. The rich environment had a profound impact on his work, and a lot of his early works embody hard-edge images of ginkgo leaves seen in the parks near the port.  The painter and sculptor liked to go on spontaneous hunts for material, wandering downtown and visiting various warehouses and sheds. He made sculptures by assembling rusted metal parts, wheels, wooden beams and leftover material from shipping trades. Indiana reached a turning point when he discovered 19th-century brass stencils, which inspired him to make his own stencil with a combination of vividly colored numbers and brightly written words, with a strong emotional message. He used this method for sculptures as well as canvases, as the main foundation for his creative expression. His work started to get a lot of attention and in 1961, the collection of his artwork called The American Dream, I gain much admiration from the audience and critiques, giving that theme profoundly explored the elusive property of American Dream.  His pieces were defined and trapped in chains of Pop Art, and although he didn't deny his involvement in the movement, he liked to expand the limits of Pop label. The essence of his work was not the mass appeal or the need to be pleasant looking and likable, it was more rooted in political allusions and social and economic references. The most important reference for Indiana was one of the literary kind, the first one appearing in a painting called The Calumet and Melville which he proudly exhibited at his first solo show in 1962. His first large work was a 20-foot EAT sign at New York State Pavillion, made of flashing lights. The EAT sculpture was appointed in 1964 by great American architect Philip Johnson in 1964 at the World's Fair in New York City. The electrified sculpture made of five six-foot disks spelling the word EAT. Many people, incorrectly, thought it was a sign for a restaurant, however, it was a sign of Indiana's greatness.  Indiana spent the 1960s creating marvelous works, collaborating with major painters and sculptors, like Warhol, with whom he made a featured movie named Eat. The movie was an experimental silent portrait of Indiana eating a mushroom in his studio. The artwork that changed everything was the LOVE image that premiered somewhere in 1966. The LOVE image first appeared in the paintings Four Star Love. Love was not just a symbol of trust in the life process, the ultimate fulfillment, for Indiana love was a driving force of life and something of spiritual significance. The first time he saw similar writing was at a local church he attended with his parents, and ever since then it remained in his memories as something of great importance. The Museum of Modern Art selected the image for their 1965 Christmas card. It quickly became a hit all around the States and was accepted by mainstream culture, and later members of the hippie movement who called themselves Love Generation.  After the LOVE image appeared on United Service postage stamp, in 1973, it reached an international success. It was printed and reprinted everywhere, from posters to the postcard, to clothing, badges, and rubber stamps. The image was reproduced in so many ways, that Indiana, unfortunately, couldn't stop the mass production of objects with his artwork. A lot of art critiques failed to show sympathy and understanding and accused the artist of being a sell-out. Those assumptions were incorrect, as Indiana always openly spoke about the profound motivation for his creations. LOVE was initially created by stacking letters in series of rubbings. He even changed the colors and used hard edges to make the subject emphasize its meaning even more. The artwork is still very popular and loved, accepted everywhere as an icon of modern art. To date, his work has been exhibited in numerous individual and collective shows across the globe, and his oeuvre is in the permanent collections of such notable museums as the MoMA in NY, the Whitney Museum of American Art in NY, the Smithsonian Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C., the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany, the Museum Ludwig in Vienna, Austria, and Israel Museum in Jerusalem, among others. The artist died on May 19th, 2018 at his home in Vinalhaven, Me. He was 89. ",50
Dimitri Likissas,"Best known for his colored dots arrangements which transform imagery into abstract, geometric forms, Dimitri Likissas is a highly-talented artist who explores the unlimited potential of chromatic and tonal scale, visual planes and volume with a two-dimensional framework. Viewing his dynamic works of art is an exciting optical experience since his pictographic arrangement seems to emerge ahead of our vision boundaries. As the colored spots matrix progress and retreat, undulate and combine, it imitates the way in which the universe works in the lively sphere of both the micro- and macrocosmos.   Born in 1969, Dimitri Likissas was raised in Belgium and has Greek roots. Around his early twenties, Likissas moved to the Caribbean where his career evolved from being a graphic designer to a corporate director of a media publishing company. From that point onward, he has turned to painting full time and his creations have discovered their way into numerous private collections mostly in Europe and America. He is influenced by his Pop Art heroes Keith Haring, whom he has personally met as a teen, Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol.   Over the years, Likissas has developed his own optical language and inimitable style, becoming a visual wizard whose art defies spatial constraints. With utmost proficiency, he invites the observer to view the world as magical, fluid and invigorating panorama. Through his paintings, the viewers sense their universe with a new range and fascinating perspective. His style emits joy, peace, and vibrant energy. The artist pursues color relationship and brings a considerable dexterity of color theory, a deep-seated sense of rhythm and formational aspects to each painting.    Although most of his earlier works included a same single colored dot pattern with a superimposed subject, today, the main element or subject of his paintings coalesces within the pattern of labor-intensive, individually colored dots. For Likissas, dot patterns serve as references to living organisms, atoms; the idea that matter is made up of discrete units which cohabitate in harmony. Many ask him “Why dots and not squares?”, his answer is that ""For me, dots keep on moving and rolling, while squares are restrictive.  From nearby, Likissas’ paintings exuberate an expression of mystery and wonder, as looking from short distance one can’t see more than colored dots, as his or her conscious can’t interpret what it’s seeing, while from far, the dots melt into a cosmos that everyone immediately understands. The artist’ wish is to take observers on imaginary journeys as they wander and unravel the optical effects of his paintings. He says “I hope that my art invites observation and lets viewers have visual discoveries.” ",51
Stanley Boxer,"Stanley Boxer was born in New York City, and began his formal education after World War II, when he left the Navy and studied at the Art Students League of New York. He drew, painted, made prints, and sculpted. His work was recognized by art critic Clement Greenberg, who categorized him as a color field painter, a designation which Boxer rejected. A truly prolific artist, Boxer liked working in different mediums and always thought that one nourished and influenced the other and that all were connected. ""In the manufacture of my art, I use anything and everything which gets the job done without any sentiment or sanctity as to medium,"" he once explained. He shifted from working with figurative imagery in the 1940s and early '50s to abstraction in the late '50s. While his abstraction in the late '60s and '70s was more derived from color-field issues, his '80s works were characterized by lots of thick paint and splashes of color. He often embedded materials such as sawdust, stones, glitter, twine, and netting, producing mysterious depths within the thick, textured, melted and bleeding color.

John Van Alstine,"John Van Alstine is an American contemporary artist known for his sculptures made of stone and metal, usually granite or slate, and found object steel. He uses stone as an assemblage element (the way a welder uses steel) rather than in the traditional manner of subtraction. In contrast to the stone and its timelessness, the found-object metal (sometimes cast bronze) is time-specific - 20th century industrial. John Van Alstine studied at St. Lawrence University, Kent State University (BFA in 1974), and at Cornell University (MFA in 1976). He worked as an assistant professor of fine arts at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and the University of Maryland in College Park, where he taught drawing and sculpture until 1986 when he moved to the NYC area to pursue studio work full time.

Damien Hirst,"Whenever you think that the creative world has seen it all, someone new comes and surprises the public with a witty, genuine, and sometimes even a shocking approach to the craft. There are many artists that have caused a wow factor with their artistic creations, but a few managed to completely change the way art is seen. Often getting a mixed response from the viewers, the British artist Damien Hirst is one of the most prominent contemporary artists present on the current art scene. His unconventional artwork has drawn a lot of attention over the past couple of decades, making him the wealthiest living British artist today.  The practice of Damien Hirst fuses any person’s biggest questions and concerns, exploring the idea of death, how it fits into life, and how both of these interact with art. The creation of such a triangle came in adolescent years of his life, as he often visited the anatomy department of Leeds Medical School as a part of making life drawings. The idea of death and its part in the life of those not yet consumed by it left a mark on Hirst that can be seen throughout his career. In the years during and following his students days at Goldsmiths college, Hirst's artistic display was mostly concerned with such ideas, and they are obvious in pieces like With Dead Head (1991) and A Thousand Years (1990). The unusual piece that portrayed a dead cow’s head being consumed by maggots and flies in a tank was the first of its kind and it launched Hirst straight into the limelight of the artistic world of the 1990s. The fact that Charles Saatchi himself was amazed by the piece and bought it straight away definitely helped propel Hirst’s reputation; regardless, the boldness and the angle of viewing things that he displayed in his early days are the qualities that made him dominate the scene during the last decade of the 20th century.   During Hirst’s time at Goldsmiths college, he received a lot more than just the knowledge of painting. His perception of sculpture and painting had drastically changed in this period, leading to some of his most influential series of works. In the second year of studies, Hirst, along with several other colleagues, organized a group exhibition titled Freeze that would end up being a “springboard” for some of the now widely known British artists. The show consisted of three stages and in the last one, Hirst displayed his spot paintings. Painting literal spots of paint on the warehouse walls, the two pieces that were displayed at Freeze would turn into possibly his most prolific series, one which he can be recognized by even today. The paintings were more than just a success for the artist, as he felt a relief making them; Hirst stated that the form solved a lot of issues that he had with color by “pinning down the joy of color.”   Establishing his position in the eye of the public, Hirst continued to give the viewers something that they haven’t seen before. Starting a series in the early 1990s, Hirst set out to create a “zoo of dead animals,” and to a certain point, he’s realized his goal. The series titled Natural History is filled with notorious works generally following the form of preserved creatures placed in steel and glass tanks filled with formaldehyde solution. The piece that can be said to represent not only the series but the modern British art at the end of the 20th century is The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living (1991). Displaying a shark in a vitrine immersed in formaldehyde, Hirst started digging deeper into the meaning of death, changing the perception of pop culture and truly tying together life, death, and art. As the name of the series implies, it wasn’t the only animal inhabiting this “unconventional zoo.” In the following years, Hirst put out several other similar works as part of different exhibitions; the most known ones include Mother and Child Divided featuring a cow and its calf cut in half and displayed in a tank filled with formaldehyde, and Away from the Flock that included a sheep displayed in the same conditions. Although these types of works had raised Hirst’s reputation in the world of painting, there have been quite a few controversies shrouding his practice and actions.   Titled as the wealthiest British artist alive, Hirst's work climbed the steps of monetary value with a seeming ease from the very start of his career. Enticed by his early ""animal"" installation works, Charles Saatchi bought a piece in 1992 titled The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living for no less than £50,000, which is an astonishing amount for someone just starting out in the art world. Naturally, the numbers only went up for Hirst's artwork and the fact that speaks of just how rapidly his work has increased in value is that Saatchi had sold The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living a bit over a decade later for £6.5 million. Though it may be hinting towards why he's the wealthiest British artist alive, this is far from his most expensive piece and the price of the materials used for some of them can tell you why. Presented in the Beyond Belief exhibition in 2007, the For the Love of God sculpture was comprised of a human skull recreated in platinum and decorated by 8,601 diamonds valued at approximately $30 million. Though there is no official record of its sale, Hirst's initial asking price for this piece was $100 million, making it one of his most valued pieces. Making himself stand out in regards of monetary value of his artwork, even setting the records in the field, was the Beautiful Inside My Head Forever auction at Sotheby's in 2008; selling a total of 218 items, Hirst managed to raise a total of $198 million, beating the former existing record for a single artist sale by more than 10 times.   Damien Hirst is, without a doubt, one of the biggest and most prominent figures on the scene of contemporary art. He has created not just monumental pieces, but whole settings, directions, and routes any artist might choose to follow in the future. However, with the moving of so many borders in a field of practice, there’s bound to be recoil coming out of certain directions and Hirst has seen his fair share of it. As much as he’s been praised on one side, there have been negative connotations and questions of the validity of “art” in his artwork. More than the way Hirst does art, there have been numerous issues of plagiarism following the works of the famous artist. From the pieces from his Natural History series to the acclaimed diamond-filled skull titled For the Love of God, Hirst has tackled the big issues of life and death while often confronting plagiarism claims from various artists. He is also known for bypassing his long-standing galleries on one occasion, selling a complete show at Sotheby’s auction that raised $198 million in 2008. Regardless of the way you might see his art, its intensity and extraordinary composition is hard to ignore. Pushing the boundaries with his ideas, the work of Damien Hirst deals with the notion of death both in its elegance and gruesome details by presenting forms and situations of equal emotional and striking value. The artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art, Puccio Fine Art, Weng Contemporary, Galerie Fluegel-Roncak, Hang-Up Gallery.  ",55
Clara Fialho,"Clara Fialho is a Brazilian-American artist known for her use of bold, bright colors that instinctively attract the eye to her work. Fialho was born in Brazil and she received her BFA from the Cooper Union on a full scholarship. Clara held her first solo show in Chelsea when she was 22. Since that show, she has been exhibiting her work worldwide. Clara’s art featured in many publications, including the cover of New York Spaces Magazine. In 2014, Fialho exhibited at Art Miami and Art Silicon Valley San Francisco. Next year, in 2015, she participated at famous Scope New York.  Clara’s dreamy abstract paintings embrace a sort of pre-postmodern sense of optimism, while expressing a very sophisticated sense of prettiness and beauty. It is as if she bespeaks that we are all one: we are one with the earth, the planets, humankind, the animals, insects and the stars… And Clara is sending that message with her loose shapes and spirals as well as fascinating patterns and details, almost like a childlike naiveté and primitivism. She is using pencil, watercolors and oil to emphasize these organic shapes that connect the viewer with her abstract vision of nature. The artist is represented by AZART Gallery.  ",56
Susan Breen,"Susan Breen is an American artist who creates beautiful abstract paintings. Growing up in Buffalo, New York in the 70s, Breen showed interest in art from a very early age. She used to draw with chalk on pavement whenever she would go on a walk with her family. Encouraged by her parents, Susan went on to pursue art career. In 1991, she obtained a Bachelor Degree at Boston College. Five years later, in 1996, Breen earned her MFA degree from School of Visual Arts in New York. At the beginning of her career, Susan briefly worked in photography, but switched to painting shortly afterwards, and has stuck to it until today. When she accepted canvas as her primary medium, she used the photographs she had taken as a basis for her oil paintings. Photography continued to play an important role in her artistic expression, as it served as a source of inspiration for Breen. Her favorites in particular were old sepia images, lost and forgotten in antique shops.  Breen is also a mother to a girl who was not only a huge impact on Susan’s life, but on her art as well. She started an online magazine called Mother-Musing, dedicated to female artists with successful careers in both art and motherhood. Even though painting in oil is her favorite medium, Breen had to briefly stop using it, because of the toxic materials. Wanting to avoid major interruptions in her artistic practice, Susan started to look for other mediums where she could still develop her artistic expression. These ended up to be photography and drawing.  Breen has received numerous awards, including Marianne Martin Award in 1991 and the AGNI Philip Guston Prize in 1999. She has had numerous exhibitions and shows across the East Coast, especially in the state of New York. Two of her more notable one-person exhibitions took place in 2008. Remedy, an exhibition which included her abstract paintings was organized by Woodward Gallery in New York. That same year, Fashion Forward was held at the Islip Art Museum in New York. Susan has also taken part in many group exhibitions as well. Both Ways is a dual show held at Woodward Gallery, which included artworks of Breen and Margaret Morrison.

Larry Zox,"Lawrence ""Larry"" Zox, born in 1937, in Des Moines, Iowa, was an American painter known for his work in the color field movement of the 1960s. Although many classified him as an Abstract artist, he considered himself to be a Colorist. Zox was part of an American Lyrical Abstraction movement, which evolved from the Color Field paintings of Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. In 1958 he moved to New York in 1958 and began making painted collages in which pieces of paper were stapled onto jointed sheets of plywood. This laid the foundation for his later work, replicating this collaged quality by using painted boundaries to create the effect of overlapping space. In 1965, he stated that being contrary is the only way he can get at anything. Zox utilized color combinations with references to nature, music, or the city that surrounds him. At times, he also used a freer, more intuitive method, while maintaining coloristic autonomy, which became increasingly important to him in his later career. His work ranges from the harmonious to the unexpected, all created with a tremendous amount of technical control.

Pierre Muckensturm,"Pierre Muckensturm is a French abstract painter and print maker born in Strasbourg. His visual language is one of harmony, calm and timelessness built around softly textured surfaces and a muted, black and white palette. Muckensturm attended Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg. Later, while studying to become a teacher, he befriended Jean Jérôme, a university art instructor, who mentored him and inspired him to enroll in painting workshops. In 2010, he was an artist in residence at Boribana Museum of Contemporary Art in Dakar, Senegal.  In 2004, Muckensturm began working with oil on large scale canvases. He isolates gestural elements, enlarging them on the picture plane to explore their presence in relation to the surrounding emptiness. He develops the paintings methodically, exploring the process of transformation the canvas undergoes in the painting process. Working the surface into a texture that belies its age, Muckensturm achieves a balance of intensity and tranquility. Since 2010, he has also added printmaking to his oeuvre. The engraving and printing process allows him to further explore notions of time and perspective. In his prints, he begins with gestural marks, examining them in detail, transforming them gradually, exploring how they communicate differently as he alters their size, shape, depth, magnitude and orientation over time.  Muckensturm is inspired by the concepts of calmness, constancy and temporality. His work visually expresses a sense of harmony with time. Initially a figurative painter, he discovered abstraction in 2004 on a visit to Notre Dame du Haut, a Modernist chapel in Ronchamp, France, designed by Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris, otherwise known as Le Corbusier. The simplicity of its forms brought Muckensturm a feeling of tranquility. He began seeking ways to directly express how felt that day. His search brought him into contact with the work of Julius Bissier, whose simple, organic, gestural brushstrokes, evocative of Taoist painting techniques, also communicate a sense of calmness. In 2010, during an artist residency in Africa, Muckensturm became inspired by the differences in how time is observed in Senegalese culture, versus the culture in which he was raised. He has since been exploring these various ideas in his work, expressing calmness and an open ended view of time.  Muckensturm has exhibited extensively in Europe, as well as in the United States and Canada. His work is included in multiple institutional collections, including that of the Museum of Fine Arts in Liège, Belgium, the Boribana Museum of Contemporary Art, Dakar, Senegal, and the Art Library of the City of La Roche-sur-Yon, France. The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",60
Jane Waterous,"Jane Waterous is an internationally acclaimed Canadian contemporary artist whose work spans an array of mediums and techniques. She studied at Queens University, OCAD University, Sheridan College, and New York University, where she completed various degrees in art and film. After being a creative director for a firm, she moved on to direct, produce and edit short films for Channel 4 UK. All of Waterous' work is inspired by the world around her, from the energetic streets of New York to the peaceful, harmonious calm Bahamian beaches. Although there are several series worth mentioning, such as Morse Series, Into the Blue Series, Resination Series, Harmony Series, she is arguably best known for The Gatherings Series. A reflection of human connection, these paintings represent an embodiment of three-decade-long work. Both literally and figuratively jumping off the canvas, the sculpture-like, three-dimensional figures appear to dance in a synergistic halo of light, depth, color, and action. While each work conveys a unique emotional experience, they all share a feeling of wonderment and joy. Jane Waterous left Canada in 1998, moving to the Bahamas with her family.   ",61

Jorge Mendez Blake,"A Mexican mixed-media conceptual artist, Jorge Méndez Blake is best known for building walls and connecting their history to literature. In his work, literature becomes a tool that articulates situations, places and objects where each piece is full of theoretical meanings related to one another. Méndez Blake was born in 1974 in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he currently lives and works. His work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in museums such as Casa de México in Spain; Kunsthalle Mulhouse, France; MARFA Contemporary; the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver and the Museum of Latin-American Art, Los Angeles, United States; among others. Throughout his career, Méndez Blake has been exploring the possible relations between literature and fine arts, and has developed a large body of work with drawings, sound works, sculptures and videos that refer to the great masters such as William Shakespeare, Jules Verne, Franz Kafka and Jorge Luis Borges, among many others. Creating a visual dialogue with literature, he creates complex pieces that provide a specific form that occurs only in the realm of imagination and desire. His work focuses on writing as ""a kind of construction,"" using his brick sculptures to connect architecture to literature. Oscillating between reality and fiction, he merges the architecture of places with landscapes of fantastic literature. ",67

Syd Solomon,"An American abstract artist, Syd Solomon is best known for works illustrating his fascination with the climatic and overall environmental conditions of land, sea, and sky. He described himself as Abstract Impressionist, alluding to the fact that his work infused impressionism into the processes, scale and concepts of Abstract Expressionism. A successful camouflage designer during World War II, Solomon incorporated this experience into his painting. Prior to D-Day, the Royal Engineer Camouflage Corps invited him to join them in London, where he mostly performed aerial reconnaissance. Learning to see from a completely different vantage point, this experience inspired his ideas of abstract art. At the end of the War, he attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Experimenting with synthetic media in the late 1940s, he was recognized by Victor D’Amico, the first Director of Education for the Museum of Modern Art, as the first to use acrylic paint. In 1946, Solomon moved to Sarasota, Florida, a move that greatly influenced his work. Inspired by climatic factors, his canvases reveal a fascination and concern for Florida’s aquatic environment. Works produced in this period often involve nature, the beach, wind, the shoreline and more. ",69
James Walsh,"James Walsh is an American abstract painter who emerged on the New York art scene in the early 1980s and gradually earned critical attention for his reinterpretation of the modernist tradition of Abstract Expressionism, Color Field, and even Art Informel. By exploiting the properties of paint to the full extent, Walsh has developed a unique visual vocabulary that enabled him to conquer new painterly territories. The surface of his canvases is a site of peculiar swirls, swoops, and blobs that build reliefs reminiscent of complex organic structures. While some compositions feature sculptural treatment of paint, the others, are saturated with richly colored surfaces that seem as they smoothly leak out at the edges of expressive brushstrokes. These fluid paintings are apparently well though by Walsh; however, they leave the impression of spontaneity and accident, as if the paint behaves on its own without the artist’s navigation. Walsh earned his Bachelor of Arts from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, and a Master of Fine Arts from Syracuse University in New York. ",70
Dmitri Wright,"Dmitri Wright is an American contemporary artist whose both current and past work has been labeled as abstract impressionist. His method is poetic and lyrical, where all contact is direct with each piece and dedicated to revealing working in the moment of creating. The painting process embodies a representational foundational method. Exploring the traditional subject of landscape, he has integrated the impressionist and expressionist schools with his vision and his training. With a palette composed of juxtaposed colors, Wright selects his colors by evoking the experiences of working in intensity and movement of the light of France’s Provence Cote d’Azur, and in Italy’s Lazio, Tuscany and Umbria, and New England’s coastal regions.

Mira Schendel,"Mira Schendel was a Brazilian artist, considered one of the most significant Latin American artists of the 20th century. Best known for her drawings on rice paper, Schendel was a painter, a poet, and a sculptor. Drawing upon the art of language and poetry, she was driven by the ability to reinvent it. Born Myrrha Dagmar Dub in 1919 in Zurich, Switzerland, Schendel moved to Italy after her mother married Count Tommaso Gnoli. She began to study philosophy at the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, but because of racial laws introduced in Fascist Italy in 1938, she was designated as Jewish, stripped of her Italian citizenship and forced to leave university. In 1939, she decided to flee Italy. After joining a group of refugees heading to Sarajevo, she had spent a war there and returned to Italy, with her first husband Josep Hargesheimer. The couple finally settled in São Paulo, Brazil in 1949. In São Paulo, she joined a circle of emigre intellectuals from different disciplines, swiftly occupying a leading place in the country’s vibrant post-war artistic scene. Her practice spanned the realms of painting, drawing and sculpture, while deriving inspiration from a range of sources – including Concrete Poetry, semiotics, phenomenology, the epic tradition, Zen Buddhism, and aspects of Eastern and Western philosophy.

Paul Snell,"Paul Snell combines traditional and digital techniques to explore the possibilities of abstraction and minimalism in contemporary photo-media. Snell earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Tasmania in 1989, his BFA (Honors) from the University of Tasmania in 1995, and his Masters of Contemporary Arts from the University of Tasmania in 2011.  Snell creates small production runs, printing each unique work in an edition of one to three. His process begins by capturing a location or an object on film with a traditional camera. He then digitally “decodes” the visual information present in that image. After reducing and simplifying the colors and forms, he begins an intensive “re-coding” process, during which the reduced formal elements of the work evolve their own self-referential relationships within a new composition. This process blurs the boundary between “taking” and “making” a photograph. When the digital composition is complete, Snell converts it into a Chromogenic print using the Lambda printing system, which allows luminous, vibrant, colorful photographic printing onto metallic paper. The print is then mounted onto Plexiglass.  The visual lexicon Snell has developed is informed by the Modernist history of painting, especially minimalism and hard-edged abstraction. Snell has described his artistic practice as a search for “sensory understanding of the physical object.”  His images are abstract, yet also declare a certain concrete recognition of their own material substance. Snell intends to create visually arresting works that allow viewers to enter into a contemplative or even transcendent state. He achieves this through the deployment of rhythmic, harmonious visual structures such as concentric circular or linear patterns.  Color relationships and spatial realities are also of primary importance to Snell. The iconic presence of his works is due in part to the dynamism of the color relationships, in part to the architectonic-yet-open nature of his compositions, and in part to the vibrant, luminous qualities of the surfaces.  Describing his work Snell has said,   Snell has exhibited his work extensively throughout Australia and Tasmania, and selectively in the United States. His work is included in numerous public and private collections, including that of ArtBank, the Devonport Regional Gallery, the Burnie Regional Gallery, and the Justin House Museum. He lives and works in Launceston, Tasmania. ",73

Billy Ma,"An under the radar painter coming increasingly under the scope of the public eye, Billy Ma is a versatile artist whose efforts focus on the fields of directing, illustrating, designing, painting and sculpting. As you will soon find out for yourself as you read through this short biography, Ma manages to handle his unique heritage with the collective consciences, making incredible paintings and prints which increase social awareness and encourage positive change, erasing the allegorical boundaries separating people with different cultures.  Due to the fact he was born in Taiwan, spent most of his development years in Canada and is currently residing in Singapore, Billy Ma often displays a unique cross-cultural perspective that is ever present in all of his pieces. He studied Fine Arts at the University of Toronto and later expanded his education by learning fashion and media design. Whilst he was still a young artist that was yet to prove himself, Ma became a member of the winning Canadian team at the International Air France student fashion design competition held in Paris, afterwards he spent some time in the F&B industry before making a final decision to move squarely back into the traditional art world where he started off his creative journey. By connecting to his eastern heritage and taping on the experiences gathered during the western upbringing, Ma brings the audience a unique visual language that virtually builds a creative bridge between the shores of the East and West. When Billy was asked what does he hope to achieve with his artworks, the painter responded with the following: I desire to engage viewers, excite clients and encourage positive change. Undoubtedly, Ma’s art is more than capable of doing so - his paintings and prints are approachable and charming, as well as quite affordable when compared to the rest of the modern art prices. Despite his obvious combination of Western and Eastern influences, Ma actually prefers to call out Leonardo da Vinci as the main source of motivation and inspiration behind his work - this is actually quite interesting as it is not that obvious if you concentrate on the sheer visuals of Billy’s artworks. The signs of the legendary Italian artist that marked the Renesance period can be seen only when you dig deeper into compositions and the very principals of Ma’s portfolio.   Besides being an impressive artist in his own right, Billy Ma is also a founder of the now famous Singaporean Booda Brand, a project dedicated to giving something back to the community, often collaborating with the likes of Affordable Art Fair in Singapore, Starwood Hotels and Resorts and SINGVART. This alone would be praiseworthy enough, but in this particular case, it serves just as a cherry on top - Ma’s humanity and magnanimity are only rivaled by his sheer talent, unique perspective and fascinating art. Between the undeniable talent, sense for composition and coloring, as well as an incredible amount of image diversity, we can’t wait to see what Ma has in store for us next.  ",77
Peter Max,"Peter Max is a German-born American illustrator and graphic artist, known for the use of psychedelic shapes and color palettes as well as spectra in his work. In 1938, Max's parents fled Berlin, Germany, his place of birth, to escape the fomenting Nazi movement, settling in Shanghai, China, where they lived for the next ten years. In 1948, the family moved to Haifa, Israel where they lived for several years. From Israel, the family continued moving westward and stopped in Paris for several months— an experience that Max said greatly influenced his appreciation for art. Peter and his parents first settled in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn in 1953 where he attended Lafayette High School (New York City), where he was classmates with future actor Paul Sorvino. In 1956, Max began his formal art training at the Art Students League of New York inManhattan, studying anatomy, figure drawing and composition under Frank J. Reilly who had studied at the League alongside Norman Rockwell. In 1962, Max started a small Manhattan arts studio known as ""The Daly & Max Studio,"" with friend Tom Daly. Daly and Max were joined by friend and mentor Don Rubbo, and the three worked as a group on books and advertising for which they received industry recognition. Much of their work incorporated antique photographic images as elements of collage. In 1970, many of Max's products and posters were featured in the exhibition ""The World of Peter Max,"" which opened at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. Max's art work was first identified as having been a popular part of the counter culture and psychedelic movements in graphic design during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He is known for using bursts of color, often containing much or the entire visible spectrum. His work was both influenced by, as well as widely imitated by, others in the field of commercial illustration, such as Heinz Edelmann. Max's repeated claims, varying in detail, to have worked on ""Yellow Submarine"" has been denied by the production team. Max works in multiple media including painting, drawing, etchings (including aquatint), collage, print making, sculpture, video and digital imagery. He also includes ""mass media"" as being another ""canvas"" for his creative expression. Max often uses American icons and symbols in his artwork. He has created paintings of presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush in addition to his 100 Clintons—a multiple portrait installation. He often features images of celebrities, politicians, athletes and sporting events and other pop culture subjects in his artwork.[1] Max is an environmentalist, vegan and defender of human and animal rights. Max currently lives in New York City.",78
Kyle Andrew Szpyrka,"Kyle Andrew Szpyrka is an American contemporary artist whose paintings are based on the journey of self-discovery and spiritual awakening. For him, painting is a method by which he assimilates and draws correspondences between various schools of thought - spiritual concepts, traditions of faith, and philosophies from around the world - all explored through meditation. Everything mentioned above influences Kyle’s work and has a direct impact on the images he paints. By sharing his paintings, he hopes to contribute to and help perpetuate the New Age Movement in which spirituality, metaphysics, and energetic principles are making their way into our mainstream culture.

Francesca Piqueras,"Born in Italy, Francesca Piqueras is a French photographer interested in objects man makes for the purposes of economy and war. Incredibly inventive when it suits us, men build these in extreme situations and in a way that can be questionable. However, Piqueras’ purpose is not to denounce. “On the contrary, the madness of man, his paradoxes and his contradictions interest me. The culmination of the aesthetics of these objects is, it seems to me, when nature takes back its rights. Time, rust, decay reinvent these architectures in sculptures and poetically rewrite the history of man. Our history.” Growing up in a family of artists, Piqueras became a solitary and attentive observer. At thirteen, she received a camera as a gift and fell in love with it. She studied the history of art, cinema, exercised the profession of an editor, without ever abandoning her camera. The photographer took a leap of faith in 2007 and showed her pictures for the first time. These works were all black and white series centered on an urban universe. Around 2011, she moved on to color.     ",80

Mr. Brainwash,"Art cannot be criticized because every mistake is a new creation. This is the motto of Mr. Brainwash aka Thierry Guetta, one of the world’s most famous and successful contemporary artists. He’s a self-proclaimed filmmaker and urban artist. It all started with filming his cousin, the Space Invader, and evolved to making an Oscar-nominated documentary with Banksy. Mr. Brainwash knows the power of good marketing and is considered to be a very successful businessman. He doesn’t really have a physical involvement in the creation of his pieces, but rather provides the ideas for his creative team to develop. His style involves copying nearly everyone, but, in a sense, he also embodies the spirit of the streets and possesses an enigmatic character similar to graffiti writers refusing to show their real faces.   Mr. Brainwash was born in Garges-lès-Gonesse, Paris, France, but relocated to Los Angeles with his father and several siblings when he was 15, after his mother passed away. Guetta was haunted by the death of his mother since he was a young child, and as a way of preserving family and friends, he picked up a video camera. During his life in the United States, Guetta filmed absolutely everything. He had several cameras set up inside his house to document his family’s life and always carried his personal camcorder with him, logging thousands of hours of eventless footage that he kept in large plastic tubs. On one visit to France, Guetta filmed his cousin, the street artist Space Invader. The experience changed Guetta’s life. He was drawn to the immediacy, impermanence and the danger of this kind of work, and as he watched Invader install video game mosaics in Paris, he became fascinated with the role of urban art in modern culture. In his early years, Guetta was a successful businessman who recognized the power of promotion. So, today he is a Pop Artist and videographer whose Graffiti and Contemporary pieces are highly valued by collectors. According to the Banksy-directed film Exit Through the Gift Shop (2010), Guetta began as a proprietor of a clothing store and amateur videographer who was first introduced to street art by his cousin Invader, and who filmed street artists through the 2000s and ""evolved"" into an artist in his own right in a matter of weeks after an off-hand suggestion from Banksy.    After returning to the United States from France, Thierry spent another 10 months following Shepard Fairey, the legendary creator of the Andre the Giant OBEY piece. Fairey showed Guetta how to choose walls and how to avoid police detection, skills that Guetta would put to good use over the next several years. Guetta soon realized that he could create a documentary from his hundreds of hours of footage (30,000 hours of footage in 12 years). He documented the creation of pieces by Buffmonsters, Borf, Swoon, Dotmasters, and eventually, Banksy (in 2009, Mr. Brainwash met with Banksy and assisted him in launching his Los Angeles show Barely Legal, which was attended by notable celebrities and collectors).  And so, the Oscar-nominated documentary Exit through the Gift Shop debuted at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The film, directed by legendary Banksy, is a story about the sudden and almost incredible rise of Mr. Brainwash at the Street and Urban Art scene. Banksy follows Guetta and witnesses his decision to switch from filmmaker to artist, without any prior experience or training. Exit through the gift shop is presenting some of his first artworks, such as Jim Morrison portrait as well as Charlie Chaplin painting. Following the premiere, Mr. Brainwash presented his work through various exhibitions, accompanied by massive interest. The one show that was held at Opera Gallery in London sold out in only two days!  “Mr. Brainwash was invented around the early '90s. When you watch TV, when you buy clothes, when you come to a bar or a club, when you do anything, how do you get there? Everything's brainwashing and I used to take any kind of brand and twist it. I would take Nike, and I'd make the logo exactly the same, but with an arrow, and I'd write under it, ""Just did it."" Instead of Kids 'R' Us, I'd put Boys Are Nuts. I couldn't use my name when I started doing street art, so I remembered Mr. Brainwash and decided to use it.  At first, I didn't sign anything, but little by little I started signing MBW. A lot of people don't call me Mr. Brainwash, they only know MBW”, he says. A number of critics have observed that his creations strongly emulate the styles and concepts of Banksy, and have speculated that Guetta is an elaborate prank staged by Banksy, who may have created the works himself. Banksy insists on his official website, however, that Guetta is not part of a prank.   It is difficult to decide whether he is serious or a clear example of the mainstream art world’s reliance on hype and style over substance. He copies nearly everyone but, in a sense, he embodies the spirit of the streets. His personality is as much a part of his allure as his paintings and sculptures. For Banksy and other Fairey, Guetta is something of an inside joke that got out of hand, but the joke has long since faded away. Mr. Brainwash is aptly named. He is as much of an enigma as the professional graffiti creator that refuse to show their faces, and deciding whether or not he’s actually serious about his work is all part of the fun. Guetta has no involvement in the physical creation of his prints and sculptures. He offers ideas which are put into action by his creative team (mostly graphic designers) and handles the publicity and marketing of the exhibitions. Mr. Brainwash also creates commissioned pieces, including a notable work for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Chili Peppers initially denied any involvement with the piece, which promoted their single. Even Madonna seemed impressed by Mr. Brainwash’s artistic approach. She reportedly commissioned him to design the cover of her greatest hits album, “Celebration.” A press release announcing the album cover referenced Brainwash’s tendency to “throw cultural icons into a blender.”   In 2011, Mr. Brainwash held a solo exhibition at London Opera Gallery. This event was followed by pretty bombastic ongoing: the night before the opening, the street outside Opera Gallery was sprayed with paint as a sign of indignation and a statement about the false nature of Guetta’s artwork. The culprit was immediately discovered: it was  RSH - Raymond Salvatore Harmon. However, Mr. Brainwash said that he really liked the street spray painted like that and that the whole commotion really stirred reactions from the public, as well as other artists. So, in the end, he declared it a success: the whole exhibition was sold out within two days (one private collector bought as much as 14 of the 36 artworks on display).   Guetta's uniformly subversive style fuses historic pop imagery and contemporary cultural iconography to create his version of a pop–graffiti hybrid first popularized by other artists. Working primarily with layers of screen print and stenciled images, his compositions are emblematic of a graffiti wall inundated with 20th century iconography. He is both sly and playful in his juxtaposition of the cultural idols of the past (Einstein, Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe) with the icons of today (Kate Moss, Madonna). The vibrant palette and imitation of pop artists like Andy Warhol and Keith Haring add a puckish wink. To add to his intentionally derivative persona, Guetta uses a special signature and authentication on all of his artworks. All unique MBW artworks have his mantra ""Life is Beautiful"", his thumbprint, hand-signature, and assigned dollar bill number sequence.   In 2014, Mr. Brainwash made a New York piece, a 9/11 mural plastered on a downtown department store adjacent to the World Trade Center site. The giant piece was completed just in time for 13th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and was commissioned by department store Century 21: ""When Mr. Brainwash came to us with this idea we were honored,"" Century 21 co-owner Isaac Gindi said in a statement. ""We are such big fans of his work and loved the idea of showing our support and dedication for the Downtown community and NYC's bravest and finest right on our building. His piece exemplifies a tribute to the resiliency of New York City and all Americans after 9/11.""   Hijack, the son of Mr. Brainwash, is himself the subject of controversy in the art world... Jacques Guetta, born in 1992, is a prodigy in his own right and one of the most talked-about, up and coming artists in today’s contemporary scene. Hijack’s works are a revelation in street art - imaginative, brilliantly constructed and seen in cultural hot spots all over the globe, from Los Angeles to London. He targeted Los Angeles’ most heavily trafficked areas - from the hikers in Runyon Canyon to the tourists of Melrose Avenue. Whether his creation is on display for an hour or a month, Hijack creates a moment of serenity and introspection for LA’s fast-paced culture.   After all the controversies and all questions coming from everywhere, there is only one logical answer. Mr. Brainwash IS an artist and NOT a carefully designed prank. Yes, his style is a bit different from his fellow artists, in terms that he’s not actually involved in the physical creation of his artworks, but, without a doubt, he’s one the most creative individuals in the world. Putting the questions of art aside, he’s extremely successful businessman and a  very active purchaser of Los Angeles real estate. He is represented by Hang-Up Gallery, Ministry of Walls, Puccio Fine Arts in New York, Galerie Fluegel-Roncak and Puccio Fine Arts in Water Mill.  Feature image: Mr. Brainwash - portrait.

Alex Katz,"An iconic figure of the 20th century New York scene, Alex Katz is an American painter and printmaker who developed his highly stylized visual vocabulary as a reaction to the ideas of Abstract Expressionism that were blossoming in the United States during the 1950s. Katz's brightly colored, large-scale figurative and landscape paintings are rendered in a flat style that oftentimes resembles the aesthetics of the everyday visual culture commonly found in advertising and cinema - a feature that regularly linked Alex to the norms of Pop art despite the fact his work predates this movement by a relatively big margin. Throughout his career, Katz has managed to avoid any sort of deeper or psychological level within artworks, instead opting to simply portray what he loves the most in this world - his family. That way, he was able to develop his simplistic style and allow the visuals to become the core of every artwork[1], offering a Pop-like and refreshing approach to art making.  Alex Katz was born in the year of 1927 to a Jewish family living in Brooklyn, New York[2]. A year after his birth, the Katz household relocated to St. Albans, Queens, where Alex spent most of his childhood. He attended classes at the Cooper Union in New York before enrolling at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. The Skowhegan institution exposed the aspiring artist with a concept of painting from life - an idea that will prove to be pivotal when Alex develops as an author. Furthermore, Katz himself admitted that the Skowhegan's plein air practice gave him a reason to devote his life to painting. From 1954 to 1960, Alex made a number of small collages of still life compositions, local Maine landscapes and small figures[3]. Slowly but surely, he was developing his own particular style - a process that requited him to destroy over a thousand of his paintings created during the first ten years of his career. This interesting fact was admitted by the author himself and it was, as he explained, all in an effort to reach his own perfect style. In the year of 1960, Katz had his first and only son, Vincent.  Since the time of the 1950s, Katz experimented with the idea of painting faster than he can think. His artworks from this era are simple, but according to Katz they are much more reductive than any other collection of his pieces ever made. His themes were also simplistic as he was avoiding adding any psychological element to his work - Alex explained such a decision with the following: The one thing I don't want to do is things already done. As for particular subject matter, I don't like narratives, basically.[4] Although he worked for years prior to that period, Katz reached great public prominence in the 1980s when he became known for his large paintings whose striking simplicity and the heightened sense of colors are now seen as early precursors to Pop Art. His pieces are usually divided into the genres of portraiture and landscape as these are the focal points of Alex's body of work. All of these artworks are defined by their flatness of both the color and the form, sporadic use of lines and the surprisingly seductive emotional detachment. One of the few main sources of inspiration Alex told was a factor in his own art was the woodcuts produced by the Japanese artist Kitagawa Utamaro.   Beginning in the late 1950s[5], Katz developed a method of painting on cut panels, initially on wood and then later on aluminum. These kinds of artworks were simply called cutouts by Alex who adored working with them. These would occupy space like sculptures, but would still have their physicality compressed into planes as the case is with paintings. The choice to work predominantly on large scale pieces came to be during the 1960s and Alex explained such a decision as a reaction to films, television and billboard advertising. Ada Katz, whom he married during the year of 1958, has been the main subject of over 250 different portrait pieces signed by Katz. Alex would start increasingly portraying groups of figures after the year of 1964.[6] He continued painting these complex groups well into the 1970s. In 1965, Katz also embarked on a prolific career in printmaking, exploring new creative grounds.[7] He would go on to produce many editions in lithography, etching, silkscreen, woodcut and linoleum cut, producing over 400 prints made by different techniques in his lifetime. Katz started designing sets and costumes as well, primarily working with a celebrated choreographer Paul Taylor. After that period, Alex decided that landscape pieces should receive more of his attention, believing that the next step of his career should have a goal of making the impression as if the viewer was inside the very piece he of she was observing.   In the late 1980s, Alex took on a new subject a lot different from anything with what he worked earlier in his life - fashion models in designer clothing. Such a practice allowed Katz to work alongside some of the biggest names in the industry, like Kate Moss and Christy Turlington. Personally, Alex enjoyed the fashion world because of its unique ephemeral nature that appealed greatly to the painter and his own set of ideas. Due to his successful works in many fields of art making, Katz has been the recipient of numerous awards during his lifetime. Just to name a few, he received The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for Painting in 1972 and, in 1987, both the prestigious Pratt Institute's Mary Buckley Award for Achievement and The Queens Museum of Art Award for Lifetime Achievement. These are only some of the exceptional recognitions Alex was on the receiving end of during the course of his career as listing all of them would take quite a while. His art is only further underlined by the fact Alex was the inspiration behind many noteworthy artistic movements and individual authors emerging from the younger generations.  It's interesting to think about how Alex Katz's simplistic, unique and utterly different style was able to rival the Abstract Expressionism at the height of its development and at a time that most of the authors were opting to say something deep and meaningful via their work. In fact, this painter/printmaker was so sure of himself that he once famously stated the following: As artists, we compete for audiences. I'm competing with the Abstract Expressionist guys. I'll knock ‘em off the wall. If you put my work next to an aggressive A.E. painting, I'll eat most of ‘em up. Against all odds and alone with his style, Katz managed to achieve widespread critical acclaim and commercial success that only a handful of other 20th century artists have managed to obtain. Nowadays, Alex is still very active as an author[8] and plays the role of a conceptual guiding star to many younger generation artists such as Elizabeth Peyton and Julian Opie. This artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art Miami, Robert Fontaine Gallery Miami, Woodward Gallery New York, Weng Contemporary, Puccio Fine Art, Galerie Fluegel-Roncak and Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac Paris.

Marc Lagrange,"Searching for intimacy and emotion, Marc Lagrange was an artist whose photographs celebrated fantasies and desires, focusing on the beauty and dreams as the main inspiration of his creative spirit. Devoted to female sensuality and eroticism, he was creating glamorous images of nude or partly nude models in luxurious settings, pictured mostly in black and white or sepia tones. The sensual look of his models, emphasized by their smoky eyes, lace underwear, hairstyle and dim light made the cinematographic impression, bringing the femininity on a higher level. A real power of his photographs lies in the fact that they reflect clearly sexual vibe without being explicit.  Lagrange was born in Kinshasa, Congo, in 1957. This Belgian artist lived and worked in Antwerp and during his career he went through engineering to photography. Preferring analog over digital, he always avoided artificial effects, using his giant Polaroids which enabled him to commit himself to the detail and express the full power of his craft and talent. As a perfectionist, Lagrange searched for the exact mood he wishes to convey, choosing every detail, from wall colors to chair shapes. He was in a constant quest for singular subjects and unexpected stories, focusing his approach on the pure humanity.    He liked to work with one model for different projects, making some of these women his muses. His greatest inspiration was Inge Van Bruystegem, talented dancer who worked with him for more than fifteen years. Important aspect of that intimate kind of cooperation is the trust that unavoidable results with the special feeling and great sincerity of his images. Appreciating female mystery and its power, even when they were fully nude, he managed that his models keep their intimacy, not completely revealing themselves to the viewer.    From 2008, besides photography, Lagrange started to create video works, like a film for the fashion brand Supertrash’s fragrance launch. In 2012, he also filmed Liesa Van der Aa’s clip for Louisa’s Bolero. Marc Lagrange tragically lost his life in a road accident on Tenerife, on December 25, 2015, at the age of 57. His work has been exhibited in several exhibitions in Europe and the United States. Lagrange also participates in Art Miami on a regular basis, and several books have been published under his name, including Polarized by Ludion in 2009 and Marc Lagrange 20 by Lido in 2009. In 2013, Diamonds and Pearls was published by teNeues in 80 countries. The following year, in 2014, he published Hotel Maritime – Room 58, a private edition limited to 300 copies whose content was shown internationally.

Frank Wimberley,"An Abstract Expressionist painter, Frank Wimberley is celebrated for his dynamic, multi-layered, and sophisticated paintings created over a career spanning more than fifty years. Growing up in the New Jersey suburbs, Wimberley was equally drawn to art and music. After the WWII, he entered Howard University, Washington, D.C., where he studied painting with three of the most influential African-American artists of the mid-twentieth century - James Amos Porter, James Lesesne Wells, and Loïs Mailou Jones. During his college years, he also got immersed in jazz, which led to long friendships with legendary musicians like Miles Davis, Ron Carter, and Wayne Shorter. Jazz remained an important part of his life, leading to an improvisational method in painting. Wimberley described his work as a ""controlled accident"", applying his paints shade by shade, brushstroke by brushstroke to arrive at a composition of overwhelming color, endless depth, size, and palpable texture. Evoking jazz, his paintings are comprised of different planes of movement, texture and color. Often large in scale, his canvases always demand an emotional response from the viewer. ",85

Throughout his career, he has pioneered new approaches to the readymade, tested the boundaries between advanced art and mass culture, challenged the limits of industrial fabrication, and transformed the relationship of artists to the cult of celebrity and the global market. He is best known for his reproductions of banal objects—such as Balloon animals produced in stainless steel with mirror finish surfaces. His sculptures often involve smooth, glistening surfaces, while his paintings employ bright and saturated colors.  Jeff Koons was born in 1955, in York, Pennsylvania. His father Henry Koons was a furniture dealer and interior decorator; his mother Gloria, a housewife and seamstress. As a child, he went door to door after school selling gift-wrapping paper and candy to earn pocket-money. As a teenager, he revered Salvador Dalí, to the extent that he visited him at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City. After high school, he headed south to Maryland, where he attended the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. Koons enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, as well, an institution that would grant him an honorary doctorate more than 30 years later. While a visiting student at the Art Institute, Koons met the artist Ed Paschke, who became a major influence and for whom he worked as a studio assistant in the late 1970s. After college, he worked at the membership desk of the Museum of Modern Art and as a Wall Street commodities broker while establishing himself as an artist. Jeff Koons had his first solo show in 1980, and by the mid-1980s, he was making a name for himself in New York as a modern pop artist along the lines of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. Employing craftsmen and manufacturers, Koons designs sculptures that mimic crappy knickknacks and iconic objects, earning both praise and condemnation from critics. He managed to set up a factory-like studio in a Soho loft on the corner of Houston and Broadway in New York. This had over 30 staff, each assigned to a different aspect of producing his work—in a similar mode to Andy Warhol's Factory, and many Renaissance artists. A self-proclaimed ""idea man"" even claims that the hand of the artist is not the important issue: ""Art is really just communication of something and the more archetypal it is, the more communicative it is.""   Among Koons's first important projects was a series of installations which started in 1979 and continued throughout the 1980s, that made use of ordinary, store-bought Hoover vacuum cleaners, shampoo machines, and polishers exhibited alone, in pairs, and/or in quadruplicate. All were encased in Plexiglas cases together with fluorescent tube lighting placed either behind or beneath the machines. Thus, these appliances seem to be icons of popular and domestic culture and of the consumerism that characterizes the modern world, but they are also animated appliances that, isolated from their normal utilitarian contexts, take on a strangely human, physical presence as ""breathing machines.""  As Koons' early work was in the form of conceptual sculpture, one of the best-known being Two Ball Total Equilibrium Tank (Spalding Dr. J Silver Series, Spalding NBA Tip-Off), consisting of two basketballs floating in water, which half-fills a glass tank. The influence on Damien Hirst's later work The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living — a shark suspended in formaldehyde in a glass tank—is unmistakable. Koons then moved on to Statuary, the large stainless-steel blowups of toys, and then a series Banality, which culminated in 1988 with Michael Jackson and Bubbles — stated to be the world's largest ceramic—a life-size gold-leaf plated statue of the sitting singer cuddling Bubbles, his pet chimpanzee. Three years later it was sold at Sotheby's New York as Lot 7655 for $5,600,000, trebling Koons' previous sale record.   Since his emergence at that time, Jeff Koons has blended the concerns and methods of Pop, Conceptual, and appropriation art with craft-making and popular culture to create his own unique iconography, often controversial and always engaging. Some of his artworks are consisted of overtly sexual themes while others have been seen as a form of neo-kitsch, such as his balloon dogs. In 2013, one artwork from the series was auctioned in the same lot as Francis Bacon's triptych of Lucian Freud and has become the most expensive piece of art by a living artist. Jeff Koons’ 12-foot sculpture Balloon Dog has broken records to become the most expensive piece of art by a living artist sold at auction. The giant stainless steel sculpture sold for $58.4 million (£36.8m) at an auction at Christie’s in New York. Balloon Dog, which formed part of Koons’ Celebration series in 1994, is part of a series of five colored sculptures in red, magenta, blue, orange and yellow. The Ballon Dog sculptures have been exhibited throughout the world, from the Grand Canal in Venice to the roof terrace of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Speaking about the artwork, Koons told Christie’s: “When I made 'Balloon Dog', I wanted to make a piece that reflected the joy of celebrating a birthday or a party. The Balloon Dog is materialism and monumentality. In many ways, it is like the Trojan horse.”   He quickly cultivated a media persona by hiring image consultants and placing strategic advertisements in high-class art publications; his scandalous marriage to and subsequent divorce from the Hungarian-Italian porn star Cicciolina also brought much public attention.  After seeing her picture in two European magazines, he had flown to Rome, watched her perform, and gone backstage to suggest that they collaborate on what he then thought would be a movie. She agreed. A series of strenuous photographic sessions became the basis for the Made in Heaven paintings and sculptures, in various media, including works with such titles as Dirty Ejaculation and Ilonaʼs Asshole, the series of enormous grainy photographs printed on canvas, glassworks, and sculptures portrayed Koons and Staller in highly explicit sexual positions and created considerable controversy. The paintings of the series reference art from the Baroque and Rococo periods – among others, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Jean-Honoré Fragonard and François Boucher – and also draw upon the breakthroughs of early modern painters as Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. The movie never got made, but Koons and Staller fell in love. Ilona Staller married Koons in 1991. The marriage began to fall apart even before their child, Ludwig, was born. Staller wanted to keep on performing. She also offered, publicly, to have sex with Saddam Hussein in exchange for his releasing foreigners held in Iraq.  Koons reportedly destroyed much of the work when Staller took their son Ludwig with her to Italy. The issue of child abduction is personal to Koons. After he spent millions of dollars in legal fees over a five-year period pursuing parental rights to his son, the Italian Supreme Court failed to recognize the couples' US-based joint custody agreement and instead sided with Staller. Koons has been a board member of The International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) since 2002, and co-founded the Koons Family International Law and Policy Institute with ICMEC; for the purpose of combating global issues of child abduction and exploitation and to protect the world’s children.   In 1999, he commissioned a song about himself, on Momus' album Stars Forever and in 2005 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Koons received the BZ Cultural Award from the City of Berlin in 2000 and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture from the Skowhegan School of Arts, New York in 2002. Nominated by President Jacques Chirac and presented by Jean-Jacques Aillagon, President of Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, Koons was named the Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur in 2001, and was promoted by President Jacques Chirac from Chevalier to Officier of the French Legion of Honor for his ongoing strengthening of relations between France and the United States. He was given the 2008 Wollaston Award from the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton honored Koons with the State Department’s Medal of the Arts for his outstanding commitment to the Art in Embassies Program and international cultural exchange in 2012. Critics are sharply divided in their views of Koons. Some view his work as pioneering and of major art-historical importance. Others dismiss his work as kitsch: crass and based on cynical self-merchandising. Koons has stated that there are no hidden meanings in his works, nor any critiques.   Among curators and art collectors and others in the art world, Koons' work is labeled as Neo-pop or Post-Pop as part of a 1980s movement in reaction to the pared-down art of Minimalism and Conceptualism in the previous decade. Koons resists such comments: ""A viewer might at first see irony in my work... but I see none at all. Irony causes too much critical contemplation"". Koons' crucial point is to reject any hidden meaning in his artwork. The meaning is only what one perceives at first glance; there is no gap between what the work is in itself and what is perceived. In an article comparing the contemporary art scene with show business, renowned critic Robert Hughes wrote that Koons is “an extreme and self-satisfied manifestation of the sanctimony that attaches to big bucks. Koons really does think he's Michelangelo and is not shy to say so. The significant thing is that there are collectors, especially in America, who believe it. He has the slimy assurance, the gross patter about transcendence through art, of a blow-dried Baptist selling swamp acres in Florida. And the result is that you can't imagine America's singularly depraved culture without him.” But, in the end, one can say that he follows the path of Marcel Duchamp, Dada, and Pop Art: Jeff Koons has created controversial works of art that forced the spectator to reexamine the impact of consumerism and popular culture on both the individual and contemporary society.   He has influenced some younger artists such as Damien Hirst (for example, in Hirst's Hymn, an 18 ft (5.5 m) version of a 14 in (0.36 m) anatomical toy), Jack Daws, Matthieu Laurette and Mona Hatoum. In turn, his extreme enlargement of mundane objects owes a debt to Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. Much of his work also was influenced by artists working in Chicago during his study at the Art Institute, including Jim Nutt, Ed Paschke, and H. C. Westermann.

Gabriel Rico,"A Mexican contemporary artist, Gabriel Rico creates work characterized by the interrelation of seemingly disparate objects. Describing himself as an “ontologist with a heuristic methodology,” he combines found, collected, and manufactured materials to create sculptures that invite viewers to reflect on the relationship between humans and our natural environment. Rico was born in 1980 in Lagos de Moreno, Mexico and currently lives and works in Guadalajara, Mexico. He graduated from ITESO (Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Occidente), Guadalajara, Mexico, BA in Architecture. His work has been exhibited all around the world, including Perrotin in Paris, New York and Seoul, Aspen Art Museum in Apsen, Cerámica Suro in Guadalajara, Mexico; ASU Art Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, Gyeonggi Creation Center in Ansan-do, South Korea, MAZ Museo de Arte de Zapopan in Zapopan, Mexico, Gallery Cuadro22 in Chur, Switzerland and Centro de arte Tomas y Valiente in Madrid, Spain. In Rico's practice, one object crisscrosses with another in the inter-objective configuration space, achieving a precise geometry despite the organic, roughly hewn character of his materials. These object range from neon, taxidermy, ceramics, branches, and more personal pieces of his past. These unusual juxtapositions result in sculptures and installations that invite viewers to reflect on the juxtaposition of the very elements that compose them. ",90

Susan Woldman,"A sculptor at heart, Susan Woldman is an American contemporary artist who brings the sculpting sensibility into her paintings, combining thick textured impasto surfaces with landscape imagery to create depth, movement, and light. Having lived in Manhattan for most of her life, painting these abstract landscapes is a way for Woldman to leave the crowded city. She earned her BA Degree from Sarah Lawrence College. After studying sculpture in Lacoste, France through the Cleveland Institute of Art, she went on to get her MFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. For many years she created colorful three-dimensional wall sculptures and larger-than-life-sized statues, but now seems focused on painting.   ",92
Nikolaos Schizas,"Barcelona based painter Nikolaos Schizas creates dynamic abstract paintings that radiate with vibrant splashes of color, and communicate a strong sense of movement and fluidity. He is inspired by a drive to explore unconscious feelings and repressed emotions. Mixing acrylics, spray paint and resin, Schizas employs a range of methods, from spraying, pouring and dripping paint directly onto the canvas, to using a mixture of traditional brushes and untraditional tools, such as spatulas, to make sweeping, gestural marks.        A self-taught painter, he expresses through his work a natural and intuitive passion for the materiality of paint, and an instinctual appreciation for emotionally charged color relationships. His fresh and vibrant aesthetic position occupies a space between Abstract Expressionism, Surrealism and Pop, and seems to emanate from a dreamlike and mysterious realm.

John Opper,"Active as a painter for over six decades, John Opper was an early member of the New York School. Over the course of his career, he transitioned from creating abstract gestural works, in which he drew inspiration from the natural world, to a pure form of abstraction. Academically trained like many of his contemporaries, Opper came to New York in 1934, two years after his graduation from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Two years later, he became a founding member of American Abstract Artists, a group formed by New York artists to promote and exhibit a style of art that was then derided by critics and shunned by collectors. He became celebrated for his handling of color and the dramatic intensity he would create with it on a picture plane. In 1990, he recalled: “I orchestrate color, line, and shape. My whole purpose is to produce an aesthetic response.” He believed that art is its own experience - an end in itself rather than a means to communicate other concerns, bespeaking a sublime relationship between the artist and his work.

Seb Janiak,"The occupation with forces in action in the work of Seb Janiak seems to represent the foundation for further investigation of various characteristics of natural phenomena. Throughout his several decade's long art practice, Janiak is constantly devoted to the surreal atmosphere of a world after tomorrow or perhaps the world before/after the humans. The photographic series of his can be perceived as a materialization of the artist’s thoughts on the philosophical subjects of spirituality and existence. Most importantly, the very notion of perception or, in this case, observing the world through the lens becomes questioned in attempt to both demystify and epitomize the experience.  Seb Janiak is born in 1966, in Paris. He began his career in the mid-1980s as a freelance graphic designer. The artist had no ambition of professional art career, yet at the end of the eight decade, Seb Janiek developed a new photographing technique called Digital Matte Printing, which allowed him to create deceptively realistic images using discrete elements and digital technology. Through the 1990s the artist has worked on refining his techniques and focusing more on a commercial aspect as a designer and photographer. Therefore, a successful transition to filmmaking came as an effect of extending techniques he had discovered in his photographic work. Due to some serious health issues, in 2001 Janiak made a decision to make a shift from his commercial work back to fine photography.   During the years, Janiak has worked with various media which were always connected, so his whole opus is framed by constant media extension. Namely, the artist’s  early work is marked by an interplay of opposites or based in a photographic realm where it is possible for opposites to coexist. As his career moved forward, the concepts became more and more experimental and the dichotomy of coexistence of opposites became even more transparent. That is specifically visible in his later works were Janiak additionally accentuates the ambiguity of narratives behind his works.    From 1986 onwards Janiak started using a Quantel Paintbox – a computerized Japanese workstation used to create graphics for broadcast television. With the advent of digital photography, Janiak evolved his approach to creating images in order to make full use of the growing advantages offered by technology. The whole process is based on layering pictures on top of each other in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. The final result is an hyper-realistic image of refined and rather polished shapes deploying a certain quality of visionary art.   While pursuing his graphic design career back in the 90’s,  Janiak’s work the attention of pop musicians and producers. His fame grew rapidly, so he started directing music videos.  Among his clients were Daft Punk, Method Man, TLC and Janet Jackson. The specific photography and peculiar imagery made Janiak as the most wanted video makers at the time.   For cover page of the magazine Soon International in 2011, Seb Janiak photographed on of the world’s most celebrated model Naomi Campbell. The images represented Campbell almost as a deity, a creature from another dimension. She was bald and her skin was plasticized while she wore high fashion clothes. A similar approach was taken for the photographs of Letitia Caste, as well as for several other models. Despite being classified as fashion photographies, these series reflected Janiak’s surge into the digital revolution.    In keeping with the lively tradition of photography, Janiak’s technological innovations opened up the possibility of creating new types of image. It seems as if the artist was from the begging of his career determined of constituting a futuristic universe with a formal perfection that was much ahead of its time.  His latest photographs of laser beams passing through prisms, attempting to capture light in its original purity reflect the peak of his creativity guided on by a restless desire to observe the world. In addition to that is the fact that the artist uses as an inspiration a multitude of traditional oriental texts and other references from a history of Western art. Seb Janiak creates strikingly powerful ensembles in which human figures were replaced by nature and ideas and yet his imagination draws on humanity in all its boundless diversity, transcending time and place.

Erro,"Coming from Iceland, the land full of beautiful landscapes, Erró has become a multi-disciplinary artist known all around the world. His style can be defined as Pop Art and Postmodern, but he can also be considered as a painter in a traditional sense, whose techniques remind of the classical European artists. Besides paintings, he also creates collages, drawings, prints, sculptures, and films. His love for traveling has taken him to places worldwide, where he collected and reassembled numerous posters, advertisements, comics, and news images, which usually included figures from artworks by Eugène Delacroix, Fernand Léger, and Pablo Picasso. These elements serve him as an inspiration. Through his ironic, sarcastic, and critical visual art, he condemns war, autocracy, economic and cultural hegemony. He is one of the first artists to recognize the significance the consumer society and media world will have in the contemporary art.   Guðmundur Guðmundsson better known as Erró was born in 1932 in Ólafsvík, Iceland. In 1951 he graduated from the Reykjavík School of Visual Art, where he was introduced to the technique of paper cut. In 1952 the artist moves to Norway to study fresco, painting, and engraving at the Oslo Academy of Fine Art. During 1954 the author studied at the Florence Academy of Art and then moved to Ravenna. Here he got familiar with the art of the Old Masters and mastered the mosaic technique. A few years later, in 1958 Erró settled in Paris, and soon became associated with the Narrative Figuration movement, whose representatives are Gérard Fromanger, Jacques Monory, and Bernard Rancillac among others. While visiting New York on several occasions between 1962 and 1966, he had the opportunity to learn and embrace new imagery, which was, unlike the one in Europe, much more colorful and impressive. During the 1960’s he also made a number of experimental movies. The first film called Grimaces was made with the producer Claude Givaudan.      In his early tempera and ink works from the 1950’s, Erró incorporated creepy figures that intertwined in what seemed as the endless struggle. Since the beginning, he was focused on the collage technique. The piles of images comprised of reproductions, posters, leaflets, postcards, news and magazines clippings served as a basic point from which he built his masterpieces. He is known for working in series, like Chinese, political, and erotic cycles- a very long process, which takes years to make collages that are transferred to paintings and canvases. He is often compared with the earlier Pop artist like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and James Rosenquist.    The use of daily ongoings in his art is explained with the fact that he wants to reinterpret the present before it goes into oblivion. In the series like Radioactivity and Meca-Make-up this Icelandic artist makes bold pieces permeated with political messages, as a reaction to the shocking images derived from the wars in Algeria and Vietnam, as well as from the rock music. Erró applies his own type of utopia to the paintings, in which he shows the beauty of contradictions and the joy of provocations. His compositions are cleverly composed of Disney characters, movie stars, comic-book heroes, and statesmen.   In 1989 the artist donated around 2000 works to the City of Reykjavik, establishing the Erró collections within the Reykjavik Art Museum. In 2000 the Icelandic Parliament awarded him the Honorary Artists Stipend and the next year with a museum dedicated to his art. Since his first exhibition at the Galleria Santa-Trinita in Florence in 1955, he displayed his pieces around the world like at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris in 1985, at the French National Gallery in 1999 or at the Valencia Institute of Modern Art in 2006. He exhibited alongside Duchamp, Max Ernst, Botero, and Velickovic. He also published fifteen monographs. The major retrospective of collages made during 50 years was held at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2010. He is represented by the Galerie Brugier-Rigail.  ",96

Alexander Calder,"One of the most celebrated sculptors of the twentieth century Alexander Calder changed the course of modern art. His most iconic works, named ‘mobiles’ by his friend Marcel Duchamp, are kinetic sculptures in which flat pieces of painted metal objects connected by wire move delicately in the air, powered only by slight air currents or propelled by motors. He made vivid, not infrequently witty, use of natural and manmade materials, including wire, sheet metal, wood, and bronze. The American-born artist also made a large number of modern outdoor sculptures – called 'stabiles' – on a grand scale from bolted sheets of steel, many of which stand in public plazas in cities across the globe.  Alexander Calder, known to his friends as Sandy, was born into a family of artists on July 22, 1898, in Lawnton – a small census-designated place in Pennsylvania. His mother was the a professional portrait painter Nanette Calder and his father was Alexander Stirling Calder, a sculptor who created many public installations most notable George Washington as President on the Washington Square Arch in New York City, and the Swann Memorial Fountain in Philadelphia. His grandfather, Alexander Milne Calder, was also a sculptor – a Scottish-American artist best known for creating the statues around Philadelphia City Hall. Calder’s sister was instrumental in the development of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.   As a four-year-old he was the model for his father’s sculpture the Man Cub, now on display in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is hard to believe that he created his first sculpture - little clay elephant - the same year. Almost three decades later, in 1930, he made a sculpture of bronze elephant that resembled his first clay sculpture. When he was seven years old, his grandfather contracted tuberculosis so his parents moved to a ranch in Oracle, Arizona, leaving the children in the care of family friends. The family reunited in 1906 and stayed in Arizona until the end of the year when they moved to Pasadena, California. There Alexander created his first studio at the windowed cellar of the family home. He used scraps of copper wire that he found in the streets to make jewelry and beads for his sister’s dolls. In 1909, the family relocated to Philadelphia and later to Croton-on-Hudson, New York. Calder's first creations were a tiny dog and a duck made out of a bent brass sheet, which he gave to his parents as Christmas presents in 1909. The duck already showed his interest in motion as it could rock to and fro when gently tapped.   In Calder’s early years in Croton, he befriended with Everett Shinn who would later become famous realistic painter and member of the Ashcan school, an artistic movement in the United States during the early twentieth century known for portraying scenes of daily life in New York, often in the city’s poorer neighborhoods. The two of them built together a gravity powered system of mechanical trains on wooden rails held by spikes. Calders did not stay long in Croton. All throughout his youth, his family moved from state to state, leaving Pennsylvania for Arizona, California, and New York. However, one thing was steady – in each new location, Alexander reserved a cellar space as a studio of his own. Finally, the American artist stayed his last high school years with friends in California so that he could graduate from Lowell High School in San Francisco in 1915. Despite his artistic talents, Calder enrolled at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken to study engineering. He received a degree in 1919 and started working as a hydraulic and automotive engineer, logging timekeeper and ship boiler fireman. One day in 1922 while working onboard, Calder woke up when the ship was passing the coast of Guatemala. The vision of both a rising sun and a full moon on opposite sides of the boat inspired the artist within. Enthralled by the scene he saw, Alexander moved to New York and signed up to the Art Students League in 1923.  During his studies at Art Students League, he produced paintings of the Ashcan aesthetic and worked at the National Police Gazette, illustrating sporting events and the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The intricate motions and choreography of circuses inspired the artist to recreate the spectacle with his own circus models made from wire, leather, cloth and other materials. Calder’s original fascination with circus went back to his childhood years when his mother took him to the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, to watch a four-horse-chariot race. This style of the event later became the base of Calder’s wire circus shows. Now living in Paris, he visited the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and established a studio in 22 rue Daguerre in the Montparnasse Quarter. Soon after, he began to make toys, which he submitted to the Salon des Humoristes.   In Cirque Calder, the artist experimented with setting a large collection of miniature acrobats, animals, and other figures in motion using springs and pulleys, arranged in vignettes. Each vignette was designed to be operated by Calder himself while the music was playing. It is one of the earliest modern works in which the artist is equally involved as both a “maker” and a performer. The entire Circus was designed so that it could be packed up into a trunk. Calder’s assemblage pre-dated those of Rauschenberg for decades! Three films were made of Calder’s Circus performances, and the Circus itself gained so much attention that Calder was always between Paris and New York, staging renderings. On one of those Atlantic crossing, he has met his future wife, Louise James, the grand-daughter of Henry James, author of The Portrait of a Lady.  Besides the fact that he found a loving wife thanks to the Cirque, this piece also gave him an insight into the Parisian avant-garde. Calder befriended with a number of avant-garde artists including Joan Miró, Jean Arp, Fernand Leger, Piet Mondrian and Marcel Duchamp. Mondrian’s colorful abstraction inspired Calder to start experimenting with abstraction. He even tried, at first, to paint in an abstract manner, but soon realized that he was a much better sculptor. At the same time, Calder came back to a toy design creating several kinetic wooden push and pull toys for children, which were mass-produced by the Gould Manufacturing Company, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  Calder continued to create wire sculptures in three dimensions. Those were usually portraits of friends, animals, and other themes he found interesting. In 1928, he held his debut solo exhibition of wire animals and caricature portraits at the Weyhe Gallery in New York. Next year, the Galerie Billiet gave him his first solo show in Paris. The year of 1931 is considered to be a turning point for this artist. Calder began to create abstract, kinetic sculptures, initially animated by cranks or motors. It was Marcel Duchamp that christened these sculptures as 'mobile' – in French, mobile both means motive and mobile. Soon, Calder realized that if suspended in air, the cranks or motors are no longer necessary. The ambient air current would move the sculpture within its space. In the end of its evolution, Calder’s mobile could be defined as a kinetic sculpture made with delicately balanced or suspended components which move in response to motor power or air currents.   The Calders returned to States in 1933 and bought a farmhouse Roxbury, Connecticut, where they raised their two daughters. There the artist created sets for Martha Graham ballet and still holding a rendering of Cirque Calder. In 1937, Calder completed Devil Fish, his first stabile enlarged from a model. Calder’s 'stabiles' revitalized a stagnant art form, reintroduced color to outdoor works, and championed the tools and materials of the modern age. During the final decade before his death in 1976, the artist received a large number of the commissions for public sculpture both in the USA and abroad. His monumental stabiles were sufficiently 'modern' yet not so radical as to look outmoded within a couple of decades. Among his many international commissions were those for the New York Port Authority (1957), and UNESCO in Paris (1958). WTC Stabile, also known as Bent Propeller, was commissioned by the Port of New York Authority in 1969 for the World Trade Center Plaza while the buildings were still being constructed. The piece was installed in 1970 and was destroyed during the 9/11 terror attacks. The term stabiles was coined in reference to Calder’s work by Jean Arp in 1931 but later was applied to similar works by other artists.    Calder was commissioned to create what he will name a Mercury Fountain for the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris World’s Fair in 1937, as well as to make a Lobster Trap and Tail for the main stairwell of the new Museum of Modern Art building in New York in 1939. The first retrospective of his work was held in 1938 at the George Walter Vincent Smith Gallery in Springfield, Massachusetts. Calder quickly became one of the leading names behind the notion of moving sculpture. In 1943, he was honored as the youngest artist ever to have a retrospective exhibition at the art world's most prestigious venue, New York's Museum of Modern Art. Curated by James Johnson Sweeney and Marcel Duchamp, the show was so popular that it was extended into 1944.   When the war broke out in America, Calder applied for the Marine Corps but was rejected. The war had the important consequences of his work: metal was being used for the war effort, so he relied more on wood. His most famous artworks from this period are the cosmologically inspired pieces he liked to call constellations. Calder was very eager to exhibit in Europe again, so in 1946 when the war ended he had a major show at Galerie Louis Carré in Paris for which Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a seminal essay. In 1949, Calder was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited at the 3rd Sculpture International at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. His piece titled International Mobile was the centerpiece of the exhibition and Calder’s largest mobile ever. In 1952, Calder represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, winning the Grand Prize for sculpture. During a yearlong stay in Aix-en-Provence, he created the first group of large-scale outdoor works. Calder also participated in the Documenta Kasel in 1955, 1959, and 1964. Calder was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Bicentennial Artist Award from the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in 1976. He died that same year at the age of 78, having achieved worldwide renown.  Internationally recognized for his original, whimsical pieces, Calder produced a wide-ranging body of work during his lifetime, including drawings, paintings, jewelry, tapestries, illustrations, prints, and set designs. Calder changed the course of modern art by developing his innovative method of sculpting – he shifted from figurative linear sculptures in wire to abstract forms in motion by creating his “drawings in space.” Calder’s fascination with balance, the natural world, and the cosmos made him one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.

Matt Siren,"Matt Siren is an American street artist and illustrator, best known for his trademark Ghost Girl image. Siren was born in New York, in a very artistically inclined family, and he was encouraged to pursue art from the very beginning. He went to School of Visual Arts, graduating in 1997, and then again in 2007. He also received his academic training at Fashion Institute of Technology, finishing it in 1999.  Siren's art is influenced by the 80s pop culture; he draws from graffiti, cartoons he used to watch when he was little, and video games. There are also some elements of posters created in Art Nouveau, and graphic design. When it comes to artists who've had an impact on his style, Siren often cites Warhol, Alphonse Mucha and Haring. His images have entered the world of fashion as well, as they can be found on numerous clothing lines. Ghost Girl is probably his most recognizable creation. Produced in 2005, the widely recognized icon combines Matt's love for video games (more specifically Pac-Man in this case) and female form. Today, Ghost Girl is synonymous with Matt Siren.  Apart from the streets, which is his greatest and most frequented ""gallery"", Siren has displayed his works at numerous indoor venues. He participated in many group and solo exhibitions around the US, primarily in New York. Some of his more notable group exhibitions include Street Language, a 2008 collaboration with Darkcloud, held at Woodward Gallery, and Stokenphobia, a 2010 group show organized by Pandemic Gallery in Brooklyn, New York.   Matt is represented by Woodward Gallery.  All images courtesy of Woodward Gallery",101
Formento & Formento,"Known for their romantic and stylish photographs, Formento & Formento explore love, loss, uncanny and perverse, longing, and the burden of memory. They utilize conceptually playful staged scenes, while the eerie sensuality of their style reveals a fascination with fiction and reality. In 2005, BJ and Richeille met while working together in South Beach, falling in love at first sight. Three months later, they were married. The roles are clearly divided - Richeille Formento is in charge of styling and artistic direction, while BJ Formento lights and photographs. Their connection, both on the personal and professional level, allows them to display all of their abilities, absorbing the spirit of a time and place, creating cinematic photographs with a vision that references the past but remains contemporary and highly original.

Macha Poynder,"Macha Poynder is a Russian-born, Paris-based artist whose multi-disciplinary oeuvre is inspired by the philosophies and aesthetic principles of Abstract Expressionism. Poynder moved permanently from Moscow to Paris in 1982. In 1983, she studied at the Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts and in 1986 earned her degree from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs.  Though Poynder works in many mediums, including painting, drawing, photography, film, and performance, the heart of her practice has always been drawing and painting. Her method emphasizes gesture, line, color, and space. Physicality and action are key to her technique. To create her drawings and paintings she expands on the methods of the Abstract Expressionists, blending automatic drawing, performative gestures, and intuitive color choices to express the depths of her unconscious.  She works with multiple layers and colors, creating works that are defined by their complexity and depth. Her textured and painterly surfaces blend areas of apparent randomness where the paint has been splashed or dripped with areas of precision, where the paint has been applied with a deliberate, trained hand.  Poynder likens her painting process to the creation of music. She considers colors to be sounds, which can form the visual equivalent of chords when placed together in a composition. She seeks rhythm in her compositions, and strives to create a sense of structure. When she first discovered the work of the Abstract Expressionists like Cy Twombly, Joan Mitchell, and Willem de Kooning, she found a kindred spirit in herself.  She is inspired by the emotive and performative aspect of how those artists worked. She paints sometimes as if she is dancing, with her lines recording the trajectory of her body and her mind. Most importantly, she is inspired by the quest to forget what she knows, so she can become liberated from her own rules, and let intuition and instinct guide her while she paints.   Poynder has exhibited internationally. Recent solo exhibitions include Buci Gallery, Paris, T1 + 2 Gallery, London, and Modernism, San Francisco. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the New York Public Library, and the Rijksmuseum, among others.

Roberto Matta,"Providing the art scene with a unique synthesis of European, American and Latin American visual cultures, Chilean-born artist Roberto Matta was an international figure known for his work which simultaneously incorporated elements from the rather different and popular movements of Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism. He worked through the concepts of these two styles and added an unconventional social and political note uncommon for both abstract expressionists and surrealists. Relying on a fascinating aesthetic vocabulary, Roberto Matta blended abstraction, figuration and multi-dimensional spaces into complex landscapes, making some of the most recognizable series of paintings that emerged from the 20th century.  Matta had a very specific and unusual family bloodline as he was of Spanish, Basque and French descent. He was born Roberto Sebastian Antonio Matta Echaurren in the year of 1911, in Chile’s capital and largest city of the state, Santiago. After a very happy childhood, Roberto decided he would like to pursue a career in architecture as this traditional art form intrigued him for years. With such goals, he studied architecture and interior design at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in his native city of Santiago, where he graduated at the top of his class in 1935. After he received his deserved diploma, Matta wanted to take some time off and enjoy the freedom which he believed will disappear the second he found employment. He journeyed from Peru to Panama, going on a self-exploration trip - a concept popular with the South America’s youth as many of them would take such tours with goals of discovering their inner selfs. Whilst voyaging, Roberto Matta would draw sights he saw around him, trying to capture the geographical features he witnessed in a highly surreal fashion. The amateur paintings he made in this time actually served as a catalyst that burned a fire underneath him - from that point on, Matta became quite interested in the medium of painting and wanted to test himself in this expressive tool, but without disregarding architecture and the affection he still had for it. In the year of 1933, Roberto moved to Paris and started to work alongside the famed architect Le Corbusier. A year later, however, it was a time for a change of scenery, as Matta traveled to Madrid, Spain, where he was introduced to Salvador Dalí. This was a pivotal moment in young Roberto’s career as the legendary Dalí encouraged him to start painting in a complete surrealistic style, as well as providing the aspiring artist with an opportunity to present his pieces to the main figure behind the movement of Surrealism, Andre Breton. After meeting with both Dalí and Breton, Matta decided he would join their movement and become an official surrealistic painter, embracing all of their stylistic features and conceptual command. As his duty among new fellow colleagues, Roberto was in charge of producing illustrations and articles for Surrealist journals such as Minotaure. During this period, he was introduced to the work of many prominent contemporary European artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp.   During the year of 1938, Matta left Europe and traveled across Atlantic, finding a new home in New York. Right about that time, his art has shifted and evolved as he finally stopped drawing and began working in oil. For the next decade or so, Roberto lived and worked in the United States, spending most of his free time creating one of the most famous projects of his career - the Inscape series. Unfortunately, Matta went from a respected member of the surrealists to a banished artist in an instant - he was accused of having an alleged relationship with Arshile Gorky's wife, a fellow artist well respected by Breton and the rest of the surrealists. After traumatized Gorky committed suicide due to his unhappiness over the unfaithful wife, colleagues with whom Matta held company saw fit to banish Roberto from their circle, refusing to speak with him or acknowledge his work. Subsequently, Matta’s connections with the Surrealism movement were severed beyond repair. Fortunately for Roberto, his reputation as a first class modern artist was already established and the banishment he suffered did not really alter his lifestyle too much, but it did make him a lonely man with many creative insecurities. After the World War II ended, the disturbing state of world politics found reflection in Matta's work, filling his compositions with images of electrical machinery and distressed figures. This kind of style lasted all through the 1950s as Roberto was obviously not able to shake off the stresses from both the war and the banishment from previous art circles. Matta spent these years between two continents, dividing his time between South America and Europe. Politics continued to over influence his work which was still prevailing in its semi-abstract style he established over fifteen years earlier. Inspired by the old concepts of Picasso’s huge canvases, Roberto as well worked on vast surfaces, with the perfect example of the mural entitled The First Goal of the Chilean People, made for Salvador Allende, the president of Chile at the time. By this time, Matta often supplemented an aesthetic of pure abstraction with elements of figuration and precisely rendered, though fantastically conceived, three-dimensional space. Through his canvases, he managed to create new dimension by blending organic and cosmic life forms, effectively making him one of the most creative and chaotic artists of his generation. Severed from the Surrealistic painters of his time, Matta was in no position to influence the future of the style but still had a lot of characteristics that once made him a part of the movement. He continued to explore the unconsciousness through a symbolic language of abstract close forms and these visual investigations effectively turned him into an early and crucial inspiration for the Abstract Expressionists. However, Roberto never officially admitted he was a part of this movement, probably because he was still hurt by the previous ejection from an art circle. His mature years were not as active as the earlier ones in an artistic sense, as he chose to focus more on family than work. Matta died on November 23, 2002, in Civitavecchia, Italy.   Roberto Matta’s legacy is not only based on his art but it also prevails through the works of his two twin sons and a daughter, all of whom are also painters and help in keeping their father’s memory alive. This is an excellent thing, as Matta’s significance in art history has been often questioned - this is undoubtedly down to his indirect role in the death of Gorky and subsequent banishment from the Surrealistic movement, meaning that all the active and future artists of this style disregarded all of Roberto’s art and refused to acknowledge its worth. Unfortunately, questionable decisions concerning his private life took precedence over his art, effectively compromising his importance to the modern art despite his work being one of the most original ones the world has ever seen. The artist is represented by GREGG SHIENBAUM FINE ART Miami, PACE GALLERY Beijing, Puccio Fine Art and THE JANE KAHAN GALLERY New York. ",107
Matt Mullican,"An American-Venezuelan visual artist, Matt Mullican works in drawing, collage, video, sculpture, performance, and installation, dealing with systems of knowledge, meaning, and language. Born in 1951 in Santa Monica, California, Mullican received his BFA from CalArts in 1974, and rose to prominence as a member of the Pictures Generation. He has exhibited world wide, including venues such as The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Haus Der Kunst, Munich, Germany, the National Galerie, Berlin, Germany, the Stedelijk Museum, Schiedam, Netherlands, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA, and The Museum of Modern Art, NY. He has taught and lectured at Columbia University, The School of Visual Arts, New York, The Rijksakademie, Amsterdam, The London Institute, Chelsea College of Art and Design, England and Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, Germany amongst several others. Oscillating between various antagonisms — reality and fiction, subject and object, the conscious and the unconscious — the artist works on our perception, defined by the projection of subjective experiences. He often creates his artworks before an audience while under hypnosis, creating a unique hybrid of performance art and drawing. His symmetrical works can be described as part schematic, part cosmological chart.",108
Mark Kostabi,"American artist and composer Mark Kostabi is best known for his Surrealism-inspired paintings featuring faceless figures. In his work, he tackles such themes as love, isolation, conformity, and technology. The artist gained world fame in the 1980s thanks to his active participation in the East Village art scene. Besides arts, he has also designed album covers for artists such as The Ramones, Guns N' Roses, Psychotica, RK: Roman Klun, Seether, Glint, and Jimmy Scott. The artist also designed mass-produced products such as Rosenthal espresso, Swatch watch, Bloomingdale's shopping bag, Giro d'Italia pink jersey, Alessi vases, and Ritzenhoff milk glasses. Today Kostabi's work can be found in numerous permanent collections, including the Groninger Museum in Holland, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery in Washington D.C, the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome, the Guggenheim Museum, Museum of Modern Art and Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art.   Kalev Mark Kostabi was born in Los Angeles in 1960. Before moving to New York, the artist studied drawing at California State University in Fullerton. He became well known in the East Village because of his work and self-interviews he regularly published. There is a lot of controversy surrounding the artist. Throughout his career, he was accused of stealing ideas and claiming credits for his assistants' work. The practice began once the artist opened the art studio Kostabi World in Manhattan and hired assistants who did all the work for him while he concentrated on self-promotion. Some of his marketing decisions were to organize a game show called Name That Painting, where art lovers, critics, and celebrities were invited to try and guess the names of Kostabi's paintings.   The most recurring themes in Mark Kostabi's work are the contemporary production of art driven by corporate greed and political, psychological, and social issues. In the 1980s, the artist adopted Andy Warhol's business model and developed his own brand. He did extensive market research, hiring professionals who generated ideas and assistant technicians who did all the work. In his art, Kostabi examines the nature of being through various subjects, including identity, individuality, the impact of social media on a day to day life, romantic love, and artistic expression. Kostabi said:   The robotic figures without faces in the artist's paintings engage in various activities giving his work metaphoric meanings. There is an ever-present philosophical aspect in the artworks that takes a critical look at the modern world. For example, in the painting Chain of Desire (2005), an artist is working on a computer strapped on the back of the assistant. Pope Benedict XVI blessed Kostabi's bronze statue of Pope John Paul II. The artist has had three Retrospective exhibitions at Chiostro del Bramante in Rome, the Art Museum of Estonia in Tallinn, and the Mitsukoshi Museum in Tokyo. Mark Kostabi lives and works between Rome and New York. Featured image: Mark Kostabi - Simply Irresistable (detail), 1988. Oil on Canvas; 172.7 x 182.9 cm. Courtesy RoGallery",109
Jill Nathanson,"An American abstract artist, Jill Nathanson is best known for her soft color-field paintings. Rich with contradiction as they explore color energies, material versus immaterial, as well as tensions between form and color, these immersive and sensual canvases stand in a category of their own. Nathanson's practice is very much process-oriented, characterized by a systematic, multistep process. After going through a thorough practice of creating studies from torn transparent paper, she finalizes placements and hues by cutting and combining until she finds relationships that spark the visual responses she seeks. She then pours polymer gels of hand-crafted oils and acrylics into elegant, fluid paintings on panel. She must do endless tests to reach exactly the right hue, saturation, and degree of transparency for her paint applications, leaving no room for error. Nathanson describes her aim as “color desire,” a quality of being, between open-endedness and finality. This allows each viewer to seek certain color qualities that are less evident, compelling them emotionally and intellectually. Featuring pale citrusy oranges and yellows, tender greens, transparent blues, and odd mauves, Nathanson's works seem to evoke the natural world and synthetic. ",110

Daniel Gottin,"Daniel Göttin is a Swiss contemporary artist. Working in a manner of minimal art, Daniel creates site-specific wall-works and paintings. In addition, Daniel Göttin is one of the directors of Hebel_121, an experimental art exhibition space located in Basel. Daniel Göttin was born in 1959 in Basel, Switzerland. Although he was initially working as a technical draftsman for an engineering company, Göttin later enrolled into the School of Visual Art in Basel, where he got his degree in 1990.   Influenced by minimalist sculptural works, Arte Povera and the collages of Kurt Schwitters, Daniel Göttin uses common industrial materials such as paint, tape, wood, metal, polystyrene, plastic, and carpet to create his site-specific wall installations, public space art, paintings, and drawings.  Through his wall installations constructed with tape, Göttin explores subjective nature of perception and seeks to reveal architectural and spatial nuances. Reminiscent of Op Art, Daniels’s wall works are iterative, responding to changing conditions and environments, and are aimed to unite art with the surrounding environment. Each new spatial situation provides a new experience of perception. The real space becomes an integral part of the installation, in a way that the artist is always inspired and challenged by the given space. Working with clear and simple geometric forms, Daniel Göttin creates artworks that activate the interaction between space, object and viewer.   Daniel Göttin’s oeuvre includes artworks that are made using many various approaches and techniques. In one series of works, Daniel created four-unit pieces consisted of acrylic painted MDF – medium density fibreboards. Same-sized and with a position that is clearly defined by the artist, units are separated by 10 cm intervals. Playing with symmetry and asymmetry, the compositions of panels are formed based on geometric patterns, unique to a singular unit.  Another example of Daniel’s art is his compact painted block, which can rather be seen as a painted wall-object than a painting. Composed of not more than three colors separated by clear linear edges, block appear very solid and dense. The viewer’s attention is directed to simple colors and space within the object, corresponding with the reflection of light and shadow. In other works, Göttin worked with an adhesive masking tapes painted over with acrylic paint, in order to create clear edges. Although the tapes were used and considered as leftovers, the artist gathered and used them for a different artwork, in which he mounted tapes on paper as a collage, and thus created a new value to the material.   Located in Basel, in 121 Hebel Street, this art venue was founded in 1998 by Daniel Göttin and Gerda Maise, an artist whose works are focused on transitioning existing objects into new visual units. As an experimental art space, Hebel_121 venue works as a platform for many foreign artists to develop and exhibit their site-specific installations. Some of the artists exhibited by Hebel_121 include Takashi Suzuki, Atsuo Hukuda, Cécile Andrieu, Kate Shepherd, Matthew Deleget, Rossana Martinez, Jurek Wybraniec, John Nixon, Julian Dashper, Jan van der Ploeg, David Tremlett, Alan Johnston, Julia Bünnagel, and Kenzo Onoda.  Since his career as an artist began in 1990, Daniel Göttin’s works have been featured internationally in over 60 solo exhibitions throughout Europe, Japan, Australia, Netherlands, Mexico and the US, in various venues such as museums, galleries, and non-profit organizations. Daniel Göttin was artist-in-residency at many different art foundation, such as the Fremantle Art Foundation, now named Artsource, Australia in 1990, Donald Judd‘s Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas in 1993, the Shed im Eisenwerk, Switzerland in 1994, the:artist:network in New York in 2005, and Youkobo Art Space in Tokyo, in the years 2007 and 2013.

Jill Baroff,"The American artist Jill Baroff examines the ever-changing nature of perception and our place within the world. In her works, she uses a self-structuring methodology in which their visual form is determined by the process by which they are made. Born in 1954 in Summit, New Jersey, United States, Baroff currently lives and works in New York. She received her BFA from Antioch University, Yellow Springs, OH in 1976, took part in the Artist Seminars Program at the Whitney Museum of Art. New York in 1978 and received MFA from Hunter College, New York in 1981. She exhibited in a range of venues, including Pablo's Birthday, New York, NY, Bartha Contemporary, London, England, Galerie Christian Lethert, Brussels, Belgium, Bronx Museum of Art, New York, NY, Bartha Contemporary, London, England, Galerie Christian Lethert, Cologne, Germany, Gallery joe, Philadelphia, PA, Kunstraum Metropol, Munich, Germany, Galerie Christian Lethert, Cologne, Germany and Margarete Roeder Gallery, New York, NY. Baroff's work reveals the artist's urge to purify, to distill a gesture or an idea until it reaches its most concentrated form. She describes her approach to countering the ""frightening complexity of a simple task"" as starting with ""a ubiquitous form of a simple table"", resulting with ""a series of variations that are so different that they obscure their common initial form. In space and in relation to the wall and floor, the sculptures develop a life of their own."" ",115
Martin Kline,"Martin Kline is an American painter, draughtsman, and sculptor, though these three practices can sometimes blend into a single artwork. Trained in studio art and having studied Italian Renaissance painting, Kline began to explore abstract art only after he moved to New York in the 1980s. Drawing from art history, philosophy, and nature, his work references Western and Eastern cultural practices. Working in an abstracted figural style, the artist focuses on flora, organisms, and mythological and literary characters. The particular sensitivity to natural motifs developed during the time Kline spent in the Hudson Valley. He is mostly known for his work in encaustic, the mixing of pigment with bees and synthetic wax. Challenging to perfect and equally compelling to behold, the artist uses this technique to create incredibly textured surfaces where the works become a phenomenological experience for the viewer.

Stephen Pace,"An American painter, Stephen Pace is known for both his Abstract Expressionist and figurative works. His exuberant style applied Abstract Expressionist scale and directness to figurative painting. Born in Charleston, Missouri in 1918, Pace was attracted to drawing from an early age. His first formal training began when he was 17, when he studied anatomical studies and watercolor painting with WPA artist Robert Lahr in Evansville, Indiana. After serving in World War II, during which he honed his skills by painting views of local scenery, he went on to study at a school in San Miguel de Allende, where he met Milton Avery who convinced him to continue his education in New York. There, he continued his studies at the Art Students League of New York and independently with Hans Hofmann. Influenced by Hofmann, he developed the direct and vigorous Abstract Expressionist style in the 1950s, characterized by a distinctive blend of brushwork, drawing and staining. After spending time in Pennsylvania and then Maine during the 1960s, Pace returned to figuration, working in a style characterized by simplified shapes and a liberal use of color. He depicted a range of subjects that celebrated everyday life and labor. ",118

Shepard Fairey,"   When you make an appearance on The Simpsons and when Black Sabbath asks you to make a promotional poster for their final tour, you’ve already reached a level of fame and popularity that seems almost unrealistic. Shepard Fairey, an icon of the American contemporary art scene, is most famous for his Obey Giant artworks and subsequent Obey series, which have found their place on t-shirts, skateboards, posters, walls, and even clothes, spreading the name of the artist throughout the USA and world, eventually. His pieces are thought-provoking and often controversial. He’s also known for the Obama-regarding posters and copyright infringement lawsuit against Associated Press, which he lost. Nevertheless, Fairey remains one of the most famous artists in the world, whose work will likely inspire generations.  Frank Shepard Fairey was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. He graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration. Fairey became involved in Art in 1984 when he started to place his drawings on skateboards and T-shirts. His first major work was reproducing black and white images of the wrestler Andre 'The Giant' Roussimoff. Andre the Giant Has a Posse is a street art campaign based on a design by Fairey created in 1989 in Providence, Rhode Island. Distributed by the skater community, the stickers featuring an image of André the Giant began showing up in many cities across the U.S.A. At the time, Fairey declared the campaign to be ""an experiment in phenomenology"". Over time, the artwork has been reused in a number of ways and has spread worldwide. At the same time, Fairey and fellow RISD student Ryan Lesser, along with Blaize Blouin, Alfred Hawkins, and Mike Mongo created paper and vinyl stickers and posters with an image of the wrestler André the Giant and the text ""ANDRE THE GIANT HAS A POSSE 7' 4"", 520 lb"", (""7'4"", 520 lbs"", or 2.24 m, 236 kg, famously being Andre The Giant's billed height and weight) as an in-joke directed at hip hop and skater subculture, and then began clandestinely (and somewhat fanatically) propagating and posting them in Providence, Rhode Island and the rest of the Eastern United States.   Fairey altered the work stylistically and semantically into the OBEY Giant. This was also to become iconic and a decisive move in Shepard Fairey's career, particularly in subsequent works that featured the ‘Obey’ word without any associated image. In a manifesto he wrote in 1990, and since posted on his website, he links his work with Heidegger's concept of phenomenology. His ""Obey"" Campaign draws from the John Carpenter movie They Live which starred pro wrestler Roddy Piper, taking a number of its slogans, including the ""Obey"" slogan, as well as the ""This is Your God"" slogan. Fairey has also spun off the OBEY clothing line from the original sticker campaign. He also uses the slogan ""The Medium is the Message"" borrowed from Marshall McLuhan. The 'Obey' sticker campaign was an experiment in phenomenology. Shepard Fairey says, ""The 'Obey' campaign had no meaning, except to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning. The intention was to provoke people through disassociating words with images that normally have an underlying motive (i.e. to sell a product)."" Shepard Fairey was responding to the effects of subliminal commercialism on audiences, prompting them to question their own role in digesting and utilizing information and to get them to think beyond their own existence. Subsequently, the 'Obey Giant' campaign, which was posted throughout the streets of California, led to the artist's arrest on a number of occasions (as it is essentially a form of graffiti); an effect, which resonates in many of his more contemporary works as well. The OBEY campaign is rooted in the Do It Yourself counterculture of punk rock and skateboarding, but it has also taken cues from popular culture, commercial marketing and political messaging. Fairey steeps his ideology and iconography in self-empowerment. With biting sarcasm verging on reverse psychology, he goads viewers, using the imperative “obey,” to take heed of the propagandists out to bend the world to their agendas.   OBEY Clothing was formed in 2001 as an extension of Shepard’s range of work. Aligned with his populist views, the clothing became another canvas to spread his art and message to the people. The clothing is heavily inspired by classic military design, work wear basics, as well as the elements and cultural movements Shepard has based his art career on. Through designers Mike Ternosky and Erin Wignall, Shepard works to create designs that represent his influences, ideals, and philosophy. Apart from initiating his own art campaigns, Fairey does select commercial work (he helped to develop a design firm called Studio Number One for this) and he designs for album art, skateboards, film posters, and clothes (he also has his own clothing line which came about as a result of the 'Obey' sticker campaign). Examples of his commercial work include designs for the Black Eyed Peas album covers for 'Elephunk' and 'Monkey Business'; the 2009 promotional material for the Earth Hour initiative and a range of creative branding designs for Pepsi, Nike, Electronic Arts, Hasbro, and Netscape, among others.   During the 2008 presidential election, Fairey’s poster of Barack Obama - a graphic, vaguely Russian-propagandist-looking portrait of the then-candidate with the word HOPE drawn in big, bold letters underneath—achieved the rare feat of becoming a visual emblem of a moment in American history. Obama, of course, won the election. The first Obama poster produced by Fairey (produced without any connection to the official Obama Presidential Election Campaign) showed a portrait of Obama (gazing upwards in the guise of a visionary leader) with the word 'Progress' underneath. Initially, official Obama campaigners kept a distance from the poster but eventually embraced it, asking Fairey to produce two revised versions. The first replaced the word 'Progress' with 'Change' and the second used the word 'Vote'. But while the Obama poster - as well as a diverse, complex, and at times controversial body of work that stretches back two decades - helped set the stage for Fairey’s first solo museum show, titled Supply and Demand, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston last year, it also attracted a different kind of attention. Fairey became embroiled in a contentious and potentially precedent-setting lawsuit with the Associated Press over his unauthorized use of one of the news service’s photographs, which was taken by photographer Mannie Garcia in 2006, as a reference for the Obama portrait. In 2009, Fairey sued the Associated Press to show in court that his portraits of Obama were fair use of the AP photograph and avoid being sued by the AP himself for copyright infringement. However, the AP claims that the artist's use of the image is copyright infringement; Fairey believes that in making the portrait, he was just exercising his First Amendment rights and that his use of the image as a reference falls under the category of fair use. Fairey’s admission in late fall that he attempted to destroy evidence of his using the Garcia image as a reference has thrown a new wrinkle into the proceedings. Fairey realized that he was wrong and that he had indeed based his work on the photograph that the AP said he had used, so Fairey panicked and tried to cover his tracks by submitting falsified evidence and attempting to delete the actual evidence from his computer. He then went ahead and claimed for months something that he knew was false. Shepard Fairey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, two years of probation, and a $25,000 after pleading guilty to one count of criminal contempt. Government lawyers believed that Fairey could have been fined up to $3.2 million and also argued that he should spend time in prison (he could have been incarcerated for a maximum of 6 months).   Shepard Fairey, who himself is a member of the punk and skateboarding sub-culture, attributes his rebellious street art streak in part to this, as well as Soviet-era propaganda, 1960s-era psychedelic rock poster art and paintings from Works Progress Administration campaigns - all sources from which Fairey derives great inspiration. Another of his controversial works was a series of posters titled 'anti-war, anti-Bush' which he created in collaboration with artists Robbie Cond and Mear One in 2004. Images in this series include the former President, George Bush, hugging a bomb and another depicting George Bush as the devil. The Obama poster campaign, however, was a shift away from this. It did not hold that antagonistic streak reflected in these previous campaigns, but rather the Obama posters captured Fairey's own forward-looking and hopeful prospects for a new direction for the United States. “I created the Obama image with a little bit of a different intention than a lot of other stuff that I make. It’s not that I haven’t put people who I admire on pedestals before, but they were usually people like the Black Panthers or the members of Black Sabbath ..” He was asked by the heavy metal band to make promotional posters for their last tour symbolically called - The End.   Since the release of the film Exit Through The Gift Shop, there has been much speculation that the film and story of Mr. Brainwash are a hoax concocted by Banksy and Shepard Fairey themselves. It is a story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles, and his obsession with street art. The film charts Guetta's constant documenting of his every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist Invader, to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on Fairey and Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice, to Guetta's eventual fame as a street artist himself. It was thanks to Fairey that Guetta gains access to street art’s most elusive genius, Banksy, who agrees to have Guetta tag along on some of his operations, such as the kidnapping and brutal murder of a London phone booth, as long as we never see Banksy’s face. However, according to a recent interview with artist Ron English, who's perhaps best known for his portrait of a rotund Ronald McDonald, the film was entirely real. English claims that the film started as a lawsuit against Thierry Guetta, the enthusiastic street artist wannabe who follows the renowned Shepard Fairey and Banksy through the first half of the film before the doc turns the cameras on Guetta's longing to be a vapid, mass-produced, faux street artist named Mr. Brainwash. Here's what English has to say: ""Here’s what actually happened: when we first met Thierry, he was supposed to be making a movie about Shepard. He was filming Shepard all the time, wherever he went. They made a deal, 50/50, we’ll make a movie. They shot for five years doing this, Shepard in his Spiderman prime, leaping off buildings and stuff. At the end of five years, Shepard says 'Alright, let’s put the movie together,' and Thierry said 'I’m not giving you the footage.' He’s actually quite smart and can be a little devious -- he figured 'I just took away five years of your fame,' because in his heart, Thierry always wanted to be the artist. He figured he was messing up his competition, in a way, and holding onto valuable footage. Shepard didn’t quite know what to do and filed a lawsuit against Thierry. Then Banksy figured 'I’m in the same situation, he has tons of footage for me.' He had some of the only footage of Banksy where you could actually see who he was. So he calls up Thierry and said 'I’m sending you a first-class ticket to London, get on the plane, I have to talk to you.' That’s when he told Thierry that he would make a movie about him instead, in exchange for the footage, which Thierry turned over to Banksy. That’s when they realized that the footage wasn’t nearly what they thought it might be, but it turns out they did get a different sort of treasure trove, because you’ve got a portrait of this weird guy, Thierry."" So Banksy and Fairey thought Guetta was going to ruin them on film, but then Banksy turned the cameras on Guetta to create a rousing critique of modern art? It sounds like a fair trade and another intriguing twist in this already engaging story.   Simpsons’ season 23, episode 15 is titled ""Exit Through The Kwik-E-Mart,"" a play on fellow street artist Banksy's 2010 documentary, ""Exit Through the Gift Shop."" In ""Exit Through The Kwik-E-Mart,"" Bart acts as a graffiti artist, plastering Homer's image all over Springfield - that is, until Bart and Millhouse get caught... Shepard Fairey, Ron English, Kenny Scharf and Robbie Conal lent their voices to the episode. In a statement on Fairey's website, the artist writes, ""Part of being on 'The Simpsons,' is you're being honored as a reference point in culture."" He later states that ""The Simpsons"" has been one of his favorite shows for the last twenty years.   In addition to his successful graphic design career, Fairey also DJs at many clubs under the name DJ Diabetic and Emcee Insulin. Shepard Fairey’s artwork for the exhibition titled 50 Shades of Black is inspired by the 12-inch record cover format. Since 2006, Fairey, a DJ and music enthusiast has continuously created artwork with the record cover template in mind. 50 Shades of Black featured 50 Hand Painted Multiples (HPMs) and a box set with screen print editions of each of the 50 new album cover designs. A record store installation with customized vintage turntables and a portion of the artist's own record collection will also be on view. Viewers can participate in the exhibition by selecting records from Fairey’s collection and playing them on the provided record players.   Among his most notable projects, Fairey's recent collaboration with Justin Peck, one of the country’s most sought-after ballet choreographers, really stands out. Their first collaboration happened in the spring of 2015 in Miami, where Fairey's art is the backdrop for a new ballet called ""Heatscape."" Peck explains that he was inspired by Fairey's murals in Miami's Wynwood arts district, part of a permanent street art exhibit called ""Wynwood Walls."" With a collaboration between Peck, the young resident choreographer of New York City Ballet who is the hottest new talent in classical dance, and famed street artist Shepard Fairey - Heatscape is one of the most high-profile premieres in MCB’s history.    The first artist permitted to create an installation at the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Fairey unveiled Earth Crisis to time with the COP21 Climate Conference in the city. He has been promoting sustainability-oriented works since the 1990s when he first designed campaign material for influential environmental groups – the installation in Paris was a continuation of those ideas. In 2017, for Trump’s inauguration, Fairey collaborated with Ernesto Yerena and Jessica Sabogal, creating a number of posters with hopes of addressing the xenophobic rhetoric of the newly elected president. The posters depicted minority Americans – black, Latina, Muslim, and Native American women. Reminiscent of the Hope poster, these new works also spread the messages of strength and optimism. The true nature of street art lies in its unpredictability. You can’t always get explicit permission to do your thing on the walls. And for Fairey, it’s all about giving his art to the people, disregarding the obstacles. The fact they liked what they saw pushed his career. And yet, due to the lack of permissions, the artist got arrested more than a dozen times and even faced felony charges in Detroit. Still, he owns the streets, roaming them in pursuit of a new perfect place to paint. This kind of persistence has made him one of the most famous artists in the contemporary world.

James Rosenquist,"The mass-production and mass media certainly framed the work of James Rosenquist and made him as one of the most intriguing artists of the second half of 20th century. This pioneer of Pop art has constructed his authentic style by combining the skills learned from his initial art lessons with the ones absorbed from commercial jobs he did for some time. The superb concepts, immense craftsmanship and outstanding articulation of political and social issues made James Rosenquist one of the most prominent representatives of the genre.  James  Rosenquist was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota. He grew up in a family of Swedish descent, and his parents were amateur pilots. At the age of 21, the artist moved to New York City in order to pursue on scholarship to study at the Art Students League. From 1957 to 1960, he earned money for his living as a billboard painter. Rosenquist quickly applied sign-painting techniques to the large-scale paintings he began creating in 1960. Like other pop artists, Rosenquist adapted the visual language of advertising and pop culture (often funny, vulgar, and outrageous) to the context of fine art.   In order to create strong narratives, Rosenquist collaged and juxtaposed fragmentary images borrowed largely from advertisements and mass media in Surrealist fashion. The overall effect was often abstract and provocative since a majority of depicted everyday objects were combined in an odd manner.  The specific process of enlarging the objects and creating rather complex relations between them was an actually base of the artist’s critical agenda of American consumerist society during the 60’s.  The pioneering technique and appropriation of such popular references quickly made him one of the key figures in the development of Pop, but such a devotion and critical activity lasted basically till the end of his career.    In 1960 was the artist began renting a small studio in lower Manhattan popular among emerging artists at the time and his neighbors included Robert Indiana, Agnes Martin, and Ellsworth Kelly. Working in this new studio space, Rosenquist began to reconsider his approach to painting due to exhaustion of the Abstract Expressionist style. In 1962, Rosenquist had his first solo exhibition at the Green Gallery in New York which was quite of success. Very soon, Collectors and influential gallery owners like Richard Bellamy and Leo Castelli began to show interest in Rosenquist's new paintings.    In 1965, James Rosenquist's exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery his huge mural painting F-111.  The piece was  originally created to cover all  walls of the Leo Castelli gallery in New York, and included separate compositions of a mushroom cloud under a beach umbrella, some spaghetti, a piece of cake, a Firestone tire, a swimmer, light bulbs, and a little girl under a hairdryer, all set against the backdrop of an F-111 fighter jet. The constellation drew much of attention in regards to the intense relationship between military might and consumer economics.    In the 1970s, the artist began work on two murals for the State of Florida, but in 1971 the artist’s  wife and son sustained serious injuries in an automobile accident, which left Rosenquist emotionally and psychologically scarred and affected his work for the next five to six years. During the following year, major retrospectives of his work were organized at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum and the other at the Whitney Museum of American Art.  Rosenquist rented a studio in Ybor City, Florida in 1974, whose climate and scenery has greatly influenced his style. During this time, James Rosenquist also became politically involved and pledge the government for better legislation to protect artists' rights and protesting the Vietnam War.    Paintings created during the seventh decade reflect the increment of political concerns, as well as his fascination with technology, modern innovations, and their sometimes conflicting relationship with nature, so by 1980, ecological issues started overwhelming  Rosenquist. His fame continued to grow and in 1987 he was admitted to the American Academy and Institute of Art and Letters in New York. Throughout the 90’s the artist mostly released large scale print, and One of them Time Dust  is thought to be the largest print in the world.   The unstoppable and continues the activity of Pop art legend in the 00’s even brought him the reputation as one of the few pop artists who’s work is still relevant. That is related with the fact that Rosenquist moved beyond his early fascination with popular culture and mass media to articulating new issues such as the intersection of science and aesthetics. In 2003 the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum staged a full-career traveling retrospective. Sadly, in 2009, a fire swept through and burned the artist's house, studios, and warehouse; all of his paintings stored on his property were destroyed, including art for an upcoming show.    The number of solo and group exhibitions over the years has become really big, as well as the number of works in the public and private collection. Rosenquist himself was the subject of a number of documentary films and was featured in two public television series, The Shock of the New and The Empire of the Signs: American Visions. The photographic use of advertisement imagery or ad-inspired painting can be noticed in the works of various later artist like Jeff Koons. Nevertheless, the artist’s innovation, progressive methods at the times, politically and socially charged concepts were always in accordance with contemporary moment meaning that during his lifetime James Rosenquist saw the work of art as an active element of human activity.  James lived in Florida and died on the 31st of March 2017. ",121
Charlotte Park,"An American abstract artist, Charlotte Park was a natural painter and gifted colorist. Her important contribution to the Abstract Expressionist movement during its early years has only recently been acknowledged. Keeping a low profile over the course of her career, she was overshadowed by the attention given to the work of her husband, James Brooks. Born in Concord, Massachusetts, Park studied from 1935 to 1939 at the Yale School of Fine Art. After moving with her husband to New York in 1945, she studied privately with the Australian artist Wallace Harrison. The couple became part of the circle of Jackson Pollock and his wife Lee Krasner, working with them and other young artists in establishing studios on Long Island before they moved to a cottage in Springs, East Hampton, which became their full-time residence. Initially working in a monochrome palette, Park reintroduced color into her art, developing a truly lyrical style. Her canvases were characterized by complex compositions and charged relationships of colors, forming a vocabulary featuring clustered loops, black curvilinear forms that both define and liberate and tensed and sensual anatomical suggestions. Later in her career, she also explored collage, drawing passages of color from her earlier paintings. Inspired by Piet-Mondrian's Neo-plasticism, she also began creating open compositions that conveyed permanence and infinity. ",122
Ken Greenleaf,"A committed modernist, working in the minimalist tradition, Ken Greenleaf creates work embedded in a philosophical and theoretical framework. His work is characterized by geometric forms, while at the same time having a freeform aspect, forcing us to mentally organize what we’re seeing into “ideas.” Greenleaf came to prominence by creating large and strongly physical welded-steel structures with complex ground planes. Over time, his work evolved to more complex structures produced with two or more materials, which depended on the distinctions between materials for their content. Developing a syntactical vocabulary reflecting actions, he theoretically based his works on the feeling that they had a past and that random, deconstructive effects were at work on their appearance. In Greenleaf's work, there is a tension between flatness and the feeling of and desire for illusion, bringing us to a place between raw sensation and the conceptual, which is ultimately a metaphysical one. The edges of his shaped surfaces, the color of his raw canvases, and the borders of his painted areas are perceived by him as “direct essays in understanding how we apprehend what we see and how we recognize what is real.” ",123
Edward Zutrau,"An artist for whom life and art were intertwined, Edward Zutrau blended precepts of the New York School with a strong physicality, drawing the viewer into both feeling and contemplation. Born and raised in Brooklyn, Zutrau was exposed to art since the young age thanks to his grandfather Michael Gunderson, a designer for the National Can Company, who later encouraged him to enroll in art classes at the Brooklyn Academy of Fine Art. He later continued his studies at the Art Career School, and also with Victor Candell at the Brooklyn Museum and Will Barnet at the Art Students League. His early works were characterized by a dynamic realist approach, over time evolving into an increasingly simplified abstract treatment of form, as well as an exploration of space and process influenced by the New York School. His art caught the attention of Betty Parsons, who held three solo shows of his paintings at her renowned New York gallery from 1972 to 1980 and became his close friend. Throughout his career, Zutrau's work was always idea-driven, representing his constant search for clarity and concision. ",124
Deborah Bigeleisen,"Deborah Bigeleisen is an American contemporary artist widely known for her floral paintings, always using a single image of a flower as her inspiration. Her technique is rooted in the labor-intensive practices of the Dutch master painters. She exclusively paints in oils and uses mediums at different viscosities. Whether creating representational images or non-objective ones, her focus is always on the choreography of the movement, the organization of the space, the subtlety in the tonal transitions, and the intricacy of the brushwork.

Marc Chagall,"Marc Chagall was a Belorussian-born Russian-French Modernist artist whose career spanned over seventy years. He left behind him numerous works in various techniques and media, including painting, book illustrations, stained glass, ceramic, and fine art prints that have established him as one of the leading artists of the Last Century. Chagall has created his own artistic style in which he combined elements of Expressionism, Symbolism, Cubism and other Modernist art movements.  Marc Chagall was born Moishe Shagal on July 7, 1887, Liozna, near the city of Vitebsk, in the north of present-day Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire. The eldest of nine children, Moishe was raised in a financially poor but loving Jewish family. His father, Khatskl (Zachar) Shagal, was a trader of pickled herring, and his mother Feige-Ite was a housewife who ran a shop and sold groceries. His brothers also worked low-paying, unqualified jobs. As a child, Moishe attended a primary Jewish religious school where he studied Torah and Talmud in Hebrew, and then gymnasium where lessons were taught in Russian. His family name, Shagal, is a variant of the name Segal, which is according to the Book of Genesis, a member of the Hebrew tribe of Levi, descended from Levi, the third son of Jacob and Leah. Moishe Segal adopted a pseudonym Marc Chagall in the French manner when he came in Paris in 1910. At the age of 19, Marc entered the private School of drawing and painting of one of the most significant Jewish painter in the Russian Empire, Yehuda Pen, under the influence of his mother although his father did not agree with it. Pen liked Moishe's bold manner of using colors so he allowed him to attend courses without any charge.   Supported by his mother, Chagall moved to Saint Petersburg in 1907. There he continued his artistic education and studied art with Russian stage designer and artist Leon Bakst. In the same year he joined the school of the ""Society of Art Supporters"" and studied under Nikolai Roerich. From 1908-1910 Chagall studied under the Russian painter and scene- and costume designer Leon Bakst at the Zvantseva School of Drawing and Painting. Influenced by contemporary Russian painting as well as by his childhood, Chagall's distinguished, inimitable style began to emerge. One of his earliest pieces is Young Girl on a Sofa, made in 1907, presenting a portrait of his sister Mariaska. Life in the former capital of Russia was difficult for Chagall. It was a time when Jewish residents could not live in Saint Petersburg without permission and he was jailed for a short period for an infringement of this rule. Despite this, Chagall remained in Saint Petersburg until 1910.   During one of his visits to his hometown in the summer of 1909, Chagall met Bella Rosenfeld, the graceful and well-educated daughter of a Jewish local jeweler. Although she was only 14 years old at the time, the couple fall in love at first sight. The two got married on July 25, 1915 and got a daughter Ida in 1916. Marc and Bella stayed together until the moment of Bella's too early death 35 years later.  Through his career, Bella Rosenfeld would always be his first and biggest love, wife and muse, the subject of many of his paintings. One of the earlier paintings inspired by his beloved Bella is The Birthday or Anniversary as it is also known, painted in 1915 and filled with closeness, caring affection, love and warmth. The Birthday is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The pieces such as Pink Lovers (1916), The Promenade (1917-1918), Bella with White Collar (1917), and Double Portrait with a Glass of Wine (1917) are just a few in which Bella Rosenfeld appears.  In 1910 Marc Chagall moved to the capital of France, where he became an important figure within the so-called Ecole de Paris. For four years, Chagall lived on a stipend of 125 francs a month from a respected Russian-Jewish lawyer Maxim Vinaver. In Paris, he met many writers and artists, including Guillaume Apollinaire, Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes. In such artistic company, Chagall began developing the poetic and innovative tendencies that had begun to emerge in Russia at the time. At the same time, he witnessed the emerging new styles of Fauvism, Cubism and Surrealism, and was influenced by the Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Fauvist pictures he saw in Paris museums. Chagall participated in the art showings at the Salon des Indépendants and the Salon d'Automne in 1912. His first individual exhibition was held at Herwarth Walden's Der Sturm Gallery in Berlin, Germany, which established him internationally as a leading artist.  Because he missed Bella who was still in his home town, Chagall returned to Vitebsk in spring 1914. Although he planned to stay long enough to marry her, the Great War broke out and postponed their return to Europe as the Russian borders were closed indefinitely. His works from this time are executed mostly in the Cubist or Expressionist styles, like in The Smolensk Newspaper (1914), Window in the Country (1915) and Bella with White Collar (1917), but he also embraced local scenes from Vitebsk in his art, working in an outstandingly realistic style like in The Praying Jew (or The Rabbi of Vitebsk, 1914), Self-Portrait (1914) and Jew in Green (1914). Marc Chagall and Bella married in 1915, when the artist began exhibiting his work in Moscow and one year later in St. Petersburg. After he participated at a Moscow show of avant-garde artists, many well-known collectors began buying his art. The painter also began illustrating a number of Yiddish books with ink drawings including I. L. Peretz's The Magician in 1917. In 1918 Chagall was appointed Commissar for Art. The same year he founded the Vitebsk Popular Art School and directed it for the next two years. In 1920 he moved to Moscow with his wife and daughter, where Chagall actively participated in theatrical life by creating draft of sets for performances, including the stage decoration for the production of Fiddler on the Roof, based on the story by a leading Yiddish author and playwright Sholom Aleichem. He executed his first stage designs for the State Jewish Chamber Theater there.  In 1922 Marc Chagall left Russia with his family, going first to Berlin, where he spent one year and found out that a large number of the pieces he had left behind before the Great War began in 1914 had been lost. In 1923, this time with a wife and daughter, he moved once again to Paris, as did many Russian intellectuals. The painter would not come back to Russia again for more than half a century. In Paris he met a French art dealer Ambroise Vollard who commissioned the artist to draw and paint various religious scenes from the Old Testament, and similar sources. Marc Chagall made illustrations for Dead Souls a novel by Russian author Nikolai Gogol.  Marc’s first retrospective took place in 1924 at the Galerie Barbazanges-Hodebert, Paris. His fame in artistic circles brought him a financial freedom, so he could travel and explore different parts of France, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and Italy with his family. The paintings made in this period were bright and joyful. In 1933 the Kunsthalle Basel held a major retrospective of his work. Marc Chagall became a naturalized French citizen in 1937.  My Life is a Chagall's autobiography written in Moscow in 1921–1922, when the artist was thirty-five years old. It is illustrated with 50 sketches and prints also by the artist. Vibrant, optimistic and mystical, My Life contains all the important moments from the first part of the artist's life – his early age, childhood and raising in Vitebsk, studies in St Petersburg, his first contact with the art world in Paris, return to his homeland and World War I.  In 1930 Ambroise Vollard commissioned Chagall to make a series of etchings illustrating the Bible. The artist used the assignment as an excuse to spend some time in Palestine. During two months the artist discovered the land of his ancestors and perceived the center of his faith. A series of over one hundred etchings illustrating the Bible was completed in 1956. However, Vollard died in 1939 so the series was published by Edition Tériade. The series incorporates numerous elements from Jewish folklore and from religious life in Chagal’s home town Vitebsk. The other Chagall’s illustrations include works by La Fontaine, Y. L. Peretz, and his autobiographical Ma Vie (1931; My Life 1960) and Chagall by Chagall (1979).  In the beginning of World War II, Chagall Marc Chagall and his family escaped to the USA along with more than 2,000 artist and intellectuals who were smuggled out of Nazi occupied territory to the USA via forged visas provided by a group of Americans who ran a rescue operation. They arrived in New York on June 23, 1941 — just the day after Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany — and spent most of the next few years in the New York area. In the United States, Chagall continued to explore themes he had already treated in France until his wife and muse Bella passed away on September 2, 1944. Thereafter, depictions of memories of his beloved recurred in the pieces such as Around Her (1945), The Wedding Lights  (1945) and Nocturne (1947).  After a death of his loved Bella, he experienced the sadness and depression that was alleviated when he met Virginia Haggard-McNeil, interpreter from French and daughter of former consul of Great Britain. She was almost two times younger than Chagall but she resembled Bella by her appearance. Marc entered into a romance with Virginia and they had a son David (McNeil), born on June 22, 1946. Their relationship lasted until 1952 when she left him with their son. Chagall’s oeuvre made in that period is dedicated to love and the joy of life, visible in such works as Cow with Parasol (1947). He also began to work in others media, including sculpture, ceramics, and stained glass. Chagall was honoured with a large retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1946 and at the Art Institute of Chicago a few months later.  Two years before Bella died, the Ballet Theatre of New York (now the American Ballet Theatre - ABT) commissioned Chagall to design scenery and costumes for a new ballet Aleko by Léonide Massine, a Russian choreographer and ballet dancer. The ballet was based on Pushkin's romantic poem The Gypsies and accompanied by the music of Tchaikovsky's Trio in A Minor. Aleko had its world premiere on September 8, 1942 in Mexico City and was shown at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York on October 6. Both the shows were a great success. Chagall painted four backdrops which was 30 by 48 feet each, including the one that set the stage with his famous folkloric symbolic elements and expressive color. He also hand-painted the wildly inventive costumes, almost 70 in all.  Also during this period, Chagall designed the backdrops and costumes for a New York production of The Firebird (1945), with the music of a Russian composer, pianist and conductor Igor Stravinsky and choreography by one of the 20th century's most prolific choreographers George Balanchine.  In the autumn 1947 Marc Chagall returned to France that had already become so native for the artist. There he attended the opening of his solo show at the one of the most visited art museums in the world - National Museum of Modern Art (Musée National d'Art Moderne) in Paris. After his relationship with Virginia ended in 1952, Chagall met Valentina “Vava” Brodskaya who became his official wife. In 1950s Chagall and Viva went on many journeys, especially across the Mediterranean - in Greece and Italy. Inspired by the wall paintings and icons, characteristic of the Mediterranean culture, the artist created a stunning color lithograph series entitled Daphnis and Chloe. Based on the Daphnis and Chloe by ancient Greek novelist and romancer Longus, which captures the triumphs and tragedies of young love.  Between 1953 and 1956, he produced his renowned Paris series inspired by his affection for Paris. In all the pieces from the series, a sequence of fantastic scenes is set against the background of views of the capital of France.   Since 1960s Chagall expanded his creativity into monumental types of art such as mosaics, stained glass windows, tapestries, sculpture and ceramics. At the beginning of 1960s, the government of Israel commissioned Chagall to make mosaics and tapestries for the Knesset (Parliament) building. Chagall designed 12 floor mosaics, one wall mosaic and three large, colorful Gobelin tapestries for the hall which later was named after the artist - The Chagall State Hall. The tapestries are presented in the form of a triptych in which each of the parts is both part of the whole and a separate unit representing the history of the Jewish people. The Chagall Hall is used for state receptions.    After the great success with The State Hall in Jerusalem, Marc Chagall received many commissions to decorate churches and synagogues all over Europe, USA and Israel. The Chagall windows at the synagogue of Hebrew University's Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem are considered by many to be one of Chagall’s major accomplishment in stained glass. In 1960 Chagall and his assistant and friend Charles Marq began creating those windows and devoted the next two years to the task. During that time, Marc and Charles developed a new technique which allowed them to use more than three colors on a single pane of glass. The famed Chagall Windows are composed of twelve abstract stained glass windows, each about 11 feet tall and 8 feet wide, representing the 12 Tribes of Israel. Completed in 1961, the stunning windows had been on display in Paris and then the Museum of Modern Art in New York, before were installed permanently in Jerusalem in February 1962.   In 1963 André Malraux, France's Minister of Cultural Affairs, commissioned Marc Chagall to paint a new ceiling for the Grand Opera in Paris. A stunning ceiling for one of the symbol of Paris is composed of 12 canvas panels and a round central panel totalling about two hundred and forty square meters and required 440 pounds of paint. The work is signed “Chagall Marc 1964” on the central and main panels and it was inaugurated on 23 September 1964 in the presence of Malraux and more than two thousands invited guests. Although the commission had a lot of opponents, Chagall, who refused to be paid for his ceiling, gained great acclaim for the project.   Over the years Marc Chagall mastered the art of stained glass, and his making decorative windows could be find at many international locations. One of his most famous stained-glass windows, entitled Peace , is located at the United Nations building in New York. Peace was presented in 1964 as a memorial to Dag Hammarskjold, a Swedish diplomat and the second Secretary-General of the United Nations, who served from April 1953 until his death in a plane crash in September 1961. The memorial, which is about 15 feet wide and 12 feet high, contains various symbols of peace and love, including the young child in the center being kissed by an angelic face which emerges from a mass of flowers, as well as the musical symbols which evokes thoughts of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which was a favorite of Mr. Hammarskjold's.  In 1967 Chagall began working on five large stained glass windows at the Fraumünster cathedral in Zurich, Switzerland. Entitled Prophets; Jacob; Christ; Zion and Law, each of the five has an intensive color and depicts a different Christian story. In 1963 Sir Henry and Lady D'Avigdor-Goldsmid commissioned Russian-French artist to design a stained glass window for the All Saints' Church in Tudeley, Kent, England. Made in a memory of memory Sarah, the daughter of Sir Henry and Lady D'Avigdor-Goldsmid who was drowned in a sailing accident off Rye, East Sussex, it is just one church in the world whose entire stained glass was created by Chagall. Between 1978 and his death in 1985, Chagall created nine stained-glass windows for St. Stephan's church in Mainz. Unique in Germany, the figures on Chagall's choir windows depict scenes from the Old Testament, showing the similarities between Christian and Jewish traditions. The America Windows, Chagall’s remarkable stained glass tribute to America installed at The Art Institute of Chicago was presented in 1977, while his last commissioned work, located in the north side of Chichester Cathedral and created when Chagall was at the age of 90, was unveiled by the Duchess of Kent in 1978.  Chagall's pieces are in collections of leading museums and institutions around the world. Some of the major retrospectives of his oeuvre was held at The Museum of Modern Art, New York (1946), The Philadelphia Museum of Art (1985) and The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2003). In 1977, the Louvre Museum, one of the world's largest museums, exhibited 62 of his works created between the years 1967 to 1977. The show was the rare opportunity for the visitors of the museum on the Right Bank of the Seine to see the works of a living artist.  Chagall’s work also was shown in numerous exhibitions at galleries and museums worldwide including at Der Sturm Gallery, Berlin (1913); Galerie Barbazanges-Hodebert, Paris (1924); Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels (1938); Museum of Modern Art, New York (1946); National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo (1963); Musee du Grand-Palais, Paris (1970); National Museum of Modern Art, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1983); Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia (1985); Royal Academy, London (1985); Tale Art Museum, Lillestrom (2006); Louisiana Art & Science Museum (2007); Nassau County Museum of Art, NY (2012), among others. In 1977 Marc Chagall became the only living French painter to hold the highest French decoration - the Cross of the Legion of Honour.   A museum dedicated to Marc Chagall, The Musée Marc Chagall (National Museum or Chagall Biblical Message), is a French national museum, located in Nice, the French Riviera. Created during the lifetime of the artist, The Musée Marc Chagall was inaugurated in 1973 and it celebrates Chagall’s life and work, especially his pieces inspired by religion. The Marc Chagall Museum is located at the Chagall family home on Pokrovskaia street in Vitebsk, Belarus. Inaugurated in 1992, it continually organizes the exhibitions of Chagall’s graphic works including lithographs, wood cuts, etchings and aquatints.  Marc Chagall continued to work vigorously until his death on March 28, 1985 in Saint-Paul de Vence on the French Riviera, at the age of ninety-seven. He was buried at the local cemetery.  ",129
Jessica Stockholder,"Canadian American artist Jessica Stockholder is best known for sculptures and site-specific installations often described by critics as ""paintings in space."" By constructing them out of everyday objects that are mass-produced, such as plywood, carpets, furniture, containers, bags, and extension cords, the artist alludes to the aesthetic qualities of these often overlooked items. Yet the artist skillfully avoids narrative storytelling or any obvious symbolism as she challenges the boundaries between the display environment and the artwork. Often her work is displayed in such a way that it utilizes the showroom space to the maximum from ceiling, floors, walls, and sometimes even spilling outside. Today her works are part of several public collections, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago.   Stockholder (born in 1959 in Seattle) showed interest in arts at an early age. At the University of Victoria in Canada, she studied painting and received her Master's in Fine Arts degree in 1985 from the Yale School of Art. In her work, one can see the influence of such masters as Donald Judd, Rebecca Morris, Henri Matisse, and Kurt Schwitters. One of her first solo exhibitions was In-side out (1984) at Art Culture Resource Center in Toronto. In the 1990s, she caught the public's attention with her large-scale works that challenged the boundaries between physical experience and pictorial, as well as the work and the space it occupied. Her site-specific works are always constructed in relation to the display space, so moving them from one site to another completely alters their impact.   The way Jessica Stockholder utilizes the full potential of the space in which she exhibits can be best seen in her work entitled Kissing the Wall (1988). In these series, the pieces are constructed out of plaster, a film projector, and fluorescent lamps that project the light straight onto the gallery wall. About her technique, the artist has often commented how hands can ""learn to do things that you could spend a whole day trying to write about and articulate."" Critics have often described her work as a barrage of everyday objects, textures, and vibrant colors that spill out of exhibition space through doors and windows. The artist, considered a pioneer of multimedia genre-bending installations, has broadened the conversation between form and space and painting and sculpture through her work.   Stockholder has had numerous solo and group shows throughout her career, including the Stuff Matters (2019) at Centraal Museum of Агt in the Netherlands, Save оп select landscape & outdoor lighting: Song to mind uncouples (2019), and Relational Aesthetics (2018) at The Contemporary Austin in Texas. Today the artist works at the University of Chicago as a head of the visual arts. Jessica Stockholder lives and works in Chicago. ",130
Sophie Calle,"A notoriously controversial figure of the European scene and one of France’s leading conceptual artists to date, Sophie Calle dedicated her career to the creative exploration of personal relationships, investigating both psychological and emotional terrains of all of us. With such goals in mind, she utilized multimedia works and counts mostly on conceptual and performance-like projects to get her messages from and across the audience. Sophie also relies heavily on photography, film and text as these practices seem to allow her the most speedy approach and the rawest artistic punch. All of Calle's artworks are meant to provoke a strong emotional reaction in the viewer, as well as to probe the ideas of control, vulnerability, freedom, gender, intimacy and distance in human relationships. Still active to this day, Sophie continues to live and work in the City of Light, tirelessly exploring the themes of intimacy, identity and the relation between the artist and her subjects.  After she completed the schooling segment of her life, Calle traveled for the next seven years. She made a full circle and returned to Paris in the year of 1979, immediately starting a series of projects with goals of reacquainting herself all over again both with the city and the people living in it. Sophie soon discovered that secretly observing the behaviors and actions of complete strangers actually provided her with a tiny window into their most honest identities. After realizing that fact, Calle desired to construct their identities from scratch, relying on paparazzi-like made photographies to document the strangers' everyday life occurrences. Since the emphasis was on the artistic idea rather than the finished object, most critics and pundits described Sophie's activities as something heavily rooted in the tradition of conceptual art. In one of her more famed examples of such kind, Calle followed a man she met at a party in Paris all the way to Venice, where she disguised herself and followed him around the city, photographing every public move he made. These stalkerish endeavors were documented via black and white photographs which were post-produced with text. Another often cited artistic work from this period was The Sleepers (Les Dormeurs) - a project in which Calle invited accidental bypassers to occupy her bed whilst she photographed them every sixty minutes. Calle also asked her mother to hire a private eye any follow her all day long - these images were united in a series entitled The Shadow (1981) and were displayed in the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. The artist explained the project as evidence of her own existence. Although these early projects were rather notorious due to their spy-like methods, these will later prove to be nothing more than mild as Sophie's mature work will be that much more controversial in the eyes of the public[1]. These early series also show the everlasting fascination Calle had with the interface between our public lives and our private selves, establishing the focal point of her career.    After she was already well-recognized for her unique work, Calle executed her The Hotel (1981) project. She was hired as a chambermaid at a hotel in Venice where she was able to explore the writings and objects of random hotel guests. Already a famous artist at this point, Sophie was in a position to explain the idea behind the project with the following statement: I spent one year to find the hotel, I spent three months going through the text and writing it, I spent three months going through the photographs, and I spent one day deciding it would be this size and this frame...it's the last thought in the process. This explanation served as an excellent insight into seeing just how Calle' mental process looked like from her own perspective. However, her career was about to take a sudden turn towards even more controversy than the use of her stalkerish ways provided her so far.  One of Calle's first projects to generate a full-blown controversy cry from the public was The Address Book (1983). After Sophie accidentally stumbled upon an address book on the street near her home, the artist decided to call some of the telephone numbers from the book and speak with the random people she might get a hold of. Accompanying the transcripts of these often weird conversations, Calle added photographs of the arbitrary man's favorite activities, creating portraits of persons she never met by exploring the insights of their personality. The articles were published in a French newspaper, but after the release, some threats of suing the artist loomed around the completed project. The actual owner of the lost address book saw this as a valid invasion of his privacy. Although his claim was more than justified, the owner did take it a step further than necessary by threatening to publish Calle's nude photograph as a way of retaliation[2]. Another of Calle's noteworthy projects from the 1980s was titled The Blind  - for its purposes, Sophie interviewed blind people and asked them to define what they believe beauty actually is. Their responses were accompanied by her photographic interpretation of their ideas of beauty and portraits of the interviewees, as was already well-established practice of Calle's art.    As both herself and her art entered more mature phases of their existence, Calle was taking her work down new roads. During the year of 1996, Sophie asked Israelis and Palestinians native to Jerusalem to take her to public locations that became a part of their private lives, exploring how one's personal story can create an intimacy with a certain place. This time, the public was shocked not by the concept behind the project, but by the sheer bravery the artist displayed by venturing to such highly dangerous locations in order to put her work into motion. During the same year, Calle released a film titled No Sex Last Night which she produced in collaboration with the US photographer Gregory Shephard. The film documents their road trip across the United States of America, which ends in a wedding chapel in Las Vegas. Instead of following already familiar concepts established by the moviemakers, the film is designed to document the result of a man and woman who barely knew each other, embarking on an intimate journey together despite being utter strangers. In 1999, Sophie exhibited the installation called Appointment, specifically conceived for the Freud Museum in London and working with the ideas of her private desires. Similar kind of work was titled The Room with a View (2002) - in it, Calle spent the night in a bed installed at the top of the Eiffel Tower. She invited people to come to her and read her bedtime stories in order to keep her awake throughout the duration of the night. The later years of the third millennium were marked by all sorts of new ideas Calle put in motion, as well as numerous republishing and updating her previous projects.[3]  Since 2005, Sophie has been teaching as a professor of film and photography at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. This expanded her field of work even further, underlining her entire career by adding a whole new regular activity. Ultimately, it's not easy analyzing Calle's career, especially if you take a more traditional artistic standpoint. Observed from such a perspective, it becomes immediately clear that there really are not any logical parallels between Sophie and any other artists out there. One sure fact concerning her art is the everlasting fascination with the difference between one's public and private personalities - by pursuing her interests, Calle investigated numerous patterns of behavior using techniques more akin to those of a private investigator then some painter. By doing so, she also explored many dark corners of her own self. Maybe the best definition of what Sophie desired to achieve with her art was given by the Christine Macel[4] who explained that her work is a rejection of the Poststructuralist notion of the death of the author by working as a first-person artist who incorporates her life into her works and, in a way, redefines the idea of the author.

Yari Ostovany,"Known for his richly textured, layered color field paintings that explore processes of metamorphosis, Yari Ostovany is an Iranian-born American contemporary abstract artist. Interested in the crossing point of the unconscious, the personal and the collective, he absorbs and projects onto the surface of the painting the energies that come to surface from the interplay of primordial contradictory forces - those within and without. Through densely layered organic compositions made over time with layers upon layers of thick and thin washes and glazes, luminous and opaque, the artist unfolds an evolutionary process. The work isn’t complete until a sense of resonance arises - when the whole finally becomes greater than the sum of its parts, when forms and marks become metaphors for a transcendent reality.  “I approach painting as the visual evidence of, and not a report on, an experience; not a representation of spiritual energy but a translation of it into light and texture, navigating the space between stasis and movement, between emergence and disappearance. My work is process based and improvisational, straddling the nebulous realm between the mystical and the mysterious and thus, to me, the spiritual. A personal journey of exploration through the alchemy of paint, color, light, texture and the poetics of space.”[1] Ostrovany’s oil on canvas works unfold over time, with each new layer of pigment, and with the processes of washing out, covering up, scraping away, and dissolving. The composition becomes deeper and more luminous with each new phase in the process. A series of calligraphic gestural marks often marks the birth of a painting, as the artist moves on to rub and dilute the marks, allowing them to meld together with previous marks and layers, coaxing new dimensions of color and texture. The transient nature of the layers becomes embedded into the visual language of the work, evoking a sense of movement and transcendence.   Influenced by a variety of different cultures, Ostovany feels a connection to multiple separate and yet complementary mystical traditions. He seeks to unravel natural and mystical processes as he looks toward elements of Western and Eastern art, literature, spirituality, poetry and music to create an environment and a mindset conducive to his process, which is connected to Abstract Expressionism and Color Field painting. Known for working in series, each of them “has its origin in a cognitive/emotional spark, an experience used as a point of departure, where gestural outbursts, atmospheric passages and the ethereal coalesce, with a blending of intellection and intuition, to perhaps bring together unfinished inventories of fragments and detritus of states of formation – the liminal states.”[2] Chellehneshin is a compound word in Persian consisting of the words Chelleh; which describes a period of forty days; and Neshin, which literally means sitting. It refers to a seeker going into solitude for a period of forty days and forty nights to pray and meditate. In several mystical traditions, The cycle of forty is a common duration needed for the metamorphosis of the spirit and transition to another, transcendent dimension. The paintings from Fragments of Poetry and Silence series are inspired by Dream, a poem by John Berger. Numinous is inspired by the meaning of the word itself – translated from Latin, it means evincing the presence of a deity; Filled with or characterized by a sense of a spiritual presence.   Born in Iran in 1962, Ostrovany moved to the United States at the age of 16, just several months before the revolution. He first pursued his artistic interests by studying at the University of Nevada – Reno before receiving his MFA in 1995 from the San Francisco Art institute. He was based in Cologne from 2000-2004, and since 2011 has been residing in the San Francisco Bay Area again. The painter has worked, taught, traveled and exhibited extensively in the USA and internationally, and is the recipient of several grants: Sierra Arts Endowment Grant, Craig Sheppard Memorial Grant, and Sierra Nevada Arts Foundation Grant. He is represented by IdeelArt.  References:  ",132
Keith Haring,"The 1990s were a time of change for many social and cultural aspects on a global scale. Art particularly saw many artists bring tremendous change in this period, and Keith Haring was one of them. Drawing and painting murals in public locations, Haring was often philosophical about his approach to creating artwork, and was amazed and inspired by the interaction and feedback he would get from people around him. Although he was young, he had developed a very specific concept of what art should represent, and the ideology carried over through his work would leave an everlasting effect on the street culture in New York City, as well as art as a whole. Along with Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, Futura 2000 and Richard Hambleton, among others, he was part of the young, up-and-coming group of the American artists who challenged art's old perceptions.  Realizing that becoming a commercial graphic artist isn’t down his alley, Haring moved on to New York to pursue his further education in painting in 1978, and soon after his arrival, he took admission at the School of Visual Art to study semiotics. Naturally, the city offered a lot of chances for artistic expression and Haring never shied from using them to demonstrate the images that existed in the back of his mind. Empty black advertising panels were available throughout, especially in the subway area, and he felt like the white chalk belongs to the surface. Filling them with quickly drawn images, some of his signature works have been made in this manner including The Radiant Baby, figures that have televisions for heads, barking dog, and others. He was able to create as many as forty subway drawings in a single day, and people would often stop and talk to Haring while he was working.   Communication with passerby's one-sided, as Haring got a lot of feedback from these sorts of engagements with the people that used the subway. A completely new type of art-making for the young American artist, drawing in front of other people had a philosophical connotation and presented something of a sociological experiment as it resulted, without fail, in a reaction from the viewers. Whether telling him that he shouldn’t be doing what he’s doing or admiring the work, Haring saw the whole thing as a phenomenon and it’s one of the reasons he kept his practice going; the honesty of people unaffected by the opinions of the elitist establishment. The subway became, as Haring said, a “laboratory” for creative experimentation.    Even during the starting days of his career, Haring founded the art dealing business to be somewhat preposterous. Although he was represented by the Tony Shafrazi Gallery since 1982, it served him more as a means to acquire funds for further artistic expression rather than marketing his work in the classical sense of the word. He strongly believed that art isn’t something that should be owned and sold as such but should be a part of the community, stating that he’s taking it off of the pedestal and returning it to the people. Furthering this idea, he founded the Pop Shop in New York City in 1986 which sold affordable items like posters and T-shirts that held his signature sign. One thing that portrays his social awareness is the fact that he donated a lot of the funds collected through the selling of his works to various charities and institutions. Having been diagnosed with AIDS, he was highly conscious of the effects of the disease and has established the Keith Haring Foundation that provides funding and imagery to children’s programs and AIDS organizations to this day. Moreover, Haring interacted with kids in many workshops in schools, museums, and as part of his work in major cities across the globe.   The Pop Shop was like an extension of Keith Haring himself - the very walls along with the ceiling of this art store were one big mural painted by Haring during 1986 when the shop was opened. Haring cared deeply for the opinion of the wide audience and the Pop Shop was, for him, the return to the train station that he used to decorate and in return get various opinions from random people. Encouraging and seeking the same sort of interaction, the shop served the same purpose and was often a place of gathering for the collectors and Bronx kids alike. Selling affordable items like shirts, hats, and other various sorts of gift items and clothing, Haring made his oeuvre accessible and promoted a different kind of relation between the artist and the viewer, one he believed is the correct one. Due to monetary issues, the Pop Shop, unfortunately, closed in 2005 after nearly 20 years of business.   Keith Haring was well aware of his illness, and though he knew his life will end untimely, he never despaired. Thinking it through thoroughly as he did with many other aspects of both life and art, his idea of death was not quite as limiting as many of us see it to be. In an interview for the Rolling Stone magazine, the American artist explains that whether our life ends tomorrow or five decades from today, there will always be some things left undone, some unrealized ideas sitting in the back of the mind itching to be shown to the world; he never really feared facing it, as it never really mattered to him: he was doing what he wanted to do until his last day. Keith Haring died in 1990 at the age of 31, but his timeless works remain as a testament to his existence. His legacy contains more than the good he has done for the world of art, and the foundation he had established fulfills its purpose even today. The artwork he created is known today more than ever, and with it, he was able to leave a mark in history and change the way the art is perceived for generations to come. His rich body of work has been included in numerous solo and group exhibitions throughout the world. Since his death in 1990, he has been the subject of several international retrospectives including at the Whitney Museum in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia and the MAC in Lyon, France. The famous American artist is represented by Woodward Gallery, Vince Fine Arts, Tony Shafrazt Gallery, Soho Contemporary Art, Rosenbaum Contemporary, Robert Fontaine Gallery, Puccio Fine Art, Pop Fine Art, Ministry of Walls, Galerie Thalberg, Galerie Fleugel-Roncak, Artsuggest.com, Allouche Gallery, We Art Partners, Dope!

Carroll Dunham," Initially inspired by Pop Art, Abstract Expressionism, and Surrealism, at the very beginnings of his career, American artist Carroll Dunham painted abstract geometric compositions on a wooden surface. His characteristic was the using of exotic veneers, such was elm, oak, rosewood or pin. Respecting the natural pattern of the surface, he was creating vibrant compositions. Spurred on by the revival of interest in Surrealism in the 1970’s, Dunham began to make abstract, biomorphic paintings reminiscent of the works of artists Arshile Gorky and André Masson, executed with a comic twist enhanced by lurid colors and the suggestion of contemporary psychedelia. Recognizable cartoonish details from his early artistic beginnings turned into the larger formats of bodily shapes resembling lips or teeth recently became more figurative, displaying striking male and female caricatures placed in familiar, but at the same time fictional surroundings.   Towards the late 1980’s, Dunham began to work with more singular motifs. Among the recurring figures in his work are wave-like forms, hated male figures in a variety of settings, mounds, trees set in pastoral landscapes, and nude female bathers. His series of Mound, which he began in the early 1990s, resemble mounds of earth but are covered with holes in neon colors. More recently, Dunham has focused on cartoon-like figures and nudes, as well as textured trees. Exploring the relations between abstraction and figuration, the artist was able to learn and develop the conceptual approach to painting and drawing. His drawings demonstrate the artist's skill in using thin lines and delicate shadings. They celebrate his ability to manipulate simple materials and lines. Carroll Dunham has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions, including a mid-career retrospective at the New Museum in New York and an exhibition of paintings and sculptures at Millesgarden in Stockholm, and has participated in the Whitney Biennials of 1985, 1991, and 1995. His work is part of a many public collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo, Brooklyn Museum, New York, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Museum of Modern Art, New York, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Tate Gallery, London, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and Whitney Museum of Art, New York. Beginning his paintings by “following his nose”, he starts the process by drawing a shape that is usually changed during the painting. It becomes finished at the moment when it comes alive and not just being a mess of stuff on a surface. Dunham admits that he always spends a long period of time looking at the painting and trying to hear what it’s telling him. Dunham’s paintings need to be read apart from the subject matter and the content contained on the canvas. Aware of the things that he doesn't want to say, his greatest concern is its literal content. Tending to return into the past, Carroll Dunham is not nostalgic but strives to question his path and development as a painter. Returning back to the earlier works and basic methodology, he is trying to find the way and reason to go forward reconsidering what an artist of a certain age is supposed to do. This focus on a passage of time is visible in his paintings where scrawled dates becoming the component of the image. Attempting to make paintings that don’t resemble anything familiar in the world, Dunham created the trio of Big Bang works that actually represent the world itself. With the working title Blobs of Yellow Plasm, he only knew that he wishes to create something large and blown up. Seeing them as abstract paintings, he remembered the Big Bang theory and realized that his depiction possesses all the associations on this occasion.     Dunham’s representations always involved concrete figures, as man or woman, but during the time, he started to build a graphic world of “things with the name” – house, tree, gun – in the attempt to purify the subject and reduce it to its essence. For example, when he draws a tree, it is not the specific one, but just tree, actually the idea of the tree. Never having the problem to talk about artists who influenced his work, Dunham would always mention Otto Dix and his contemporaries Elizabeth Murray and Kara Walker. On his series of Bathers, strange geometries collide with organic form. The figure of a female bather is composed of outlined, shaded shapes created from the painting’s white ground. Unlike the other object, she is not filled in, which emphasizes her presence. Faceless, her body might belong to a specific woman, but without representing a real person. Writing some review on Otto Dix and late Renoir, Carroll Dunham was drawn to late 19th and early 20th-century French painting, starting to think about the theme of bathers throughout art history.  The best example of his subject vs. content concerns is Horse and Rider (My X), 2013-15, which makes the viewer considers what is the real subject – the X that splits the surface into four quadrants, marking the center of some other realm, or a horse with a woman on his back who obviously have a question for a viewer, whose figure represents the beginning of recessive planes of composition that make the impression of depth. When he started this painting, first move that he done was a chalk line X that noted the segments of the surface. Initial theme was a fantasy of woman on a horse, but he later realized that the other level is equally important (X as a generative principle) and must be a part of a title. Creating the horse that stares into the viewer, Carroll Dunham, unlike in his previous work, made a weird eye contact, giving the narrative implications that courage the people to imagine the story behind. The other major Bather painting Game, 2013-15, abounds narrative implications. With the swinging bather in the foreground, four strange birds randomly staggered around have fully occupied the space, taking over the role of main subject.   While he paints, Dunham often thinks about different theories and meaning of painting itself. Always looking for some answers, he reexamines his early thoughts about his art, comparing them to things he feels or thinks today. His idea about how to make an artwork came from the presumption about of diagram of painting or its function as the demonstration model. Still, aware of differences and progress, he can't find the source of his change, having the subjective experience of stagnation because of the same problems and characteristic approach to them through his whole career. He spends years building pieces of his universe, developing each fragment of his visual language, from hallucinatory, anatomical abstraction of biomorphic shapes from the beginning of his career to the first signs of angry faces and fat bodies, and sun, tree and a mountain as the basic elements of a usual landscape. The next step was a masculine dystopia, the world inhabited by eyeless, penis-nosed men in suits and top hats, compulsively recreated from different angles, through numerous drawings, paintings, and sculptures. Since 2010, Dunham changed the territory, moving from hell into the feminine world of heaven in his works. Blue skies, green hills, and colorful flowers are the place where lives nude woman with the long black hair and emphasized vagina and nipples. Still, for Dunham, his direct subjects, and the scenes are just a part of a construction that he skillfully uses, making the numerous arrangements that transform his abstract thought into the worldly shape.     Always striving to create the atmosphere of possibility where things seem to be in a kind of motion, the artist indicates the movement that could be going forward or backward. The viewer has a chance to see only the fragment of it. Dunham also asserts the fact that he is not kind of painter that thinks symbolically. There are no references or literary terms, but the pure truth, like any other experience in anybody’s life. The things that come up in his paintings tends to be much more an expression of an attitude about the process than of an attitude about the subject matter. Deprived of a female presence, his series Now and Around Here is prepared through 150 drawings before he achieved the final version. Feels like “femaleness needs maleness” to achieved the balance, he included the first appearance of a man in about eight years. Starting from his own body he tried to understand how to approach to his new theme. Taking the example of works by artists Mantegna and John Semmel as precedents that used to represent the body in space in that kind of way, Dunham still chose to experiment with his own train of thought. His final canvas, number 3, is the most striking, having the unexpected depiction of the dog looking out at the viewer. Like horse or birds on the previous paintings, the dog represents human’s close friend, the animal that has been there since the beginning. The falling leaves and autumnal colors leave the impression of sorrow, but also of the hope at the same time. His reclining man has seen bright skies of green and purple, but things have changed. The dog is a narrative signifier and abstract code, created of colors and lines, but with the longing gaze.    During his long career, Carroll Dunham developed a highly personal style. Some people connect Dunham’s work with cartoons. Sometimes, they find his paintings funny, although the author himself don’t think they are. He is trying to let something open up, not necessarily his personality, but his emotional side as an artist. Juxtapositions can be humorous, even when the artist has no intention to be funny. Viewer’s imagination has no limits and sometimes goes over any expectations. Creating scenes with multiple cartoonish and biomorphic subjects interact, his works often have sexually suggestive narratives. Considering painting as something that is not about individual subjectivity, but the mixture of craft and philosophy, Dunham’s only interest lies in the process and tradition of painting, instead of symbolism and metaphorical meanings. Unifying elements of Pop Art, Graffiti, Surrealism and Abstraction, his work reference artists Paul Gauguin, Arshile Gorky and Philip Guston.  ",134
Matthieu Venot,"Hailing from Brest, a city in Brittany, northwestern France, Matthieu Venot is a self-taught photographer who turns architectural details of his hometown into cleanly composed minimalist images that stand out from a deep blue sky. He plays with glazing façades, windows, bannisters, balconies, and similar elements of the urban environment, combining them with the pallid blue of the sky to create pure and original compositions. What's more appealing about his photography is the fact that his images are universal – although they portray specific place in the specific city, they could easily be images of the 1960s or 1970s buildings in any city on any golden and cloudless day.  Venot depicts neutral exteriors, devoid of human presence, filled with geometric forms and pastel colors. He has developed a distinctive minimal approach to convey a calming atmosphere where light and man-made architecture are a dominant force. In the series such as Prism, Urban Nautilus, Firework, and Who Wants Sky, Matthieu uses the blue of the sky as a background to emphasize the beauty and the thrill of modern constructions. His photographs give an optimistic view of reality. By taking points from architecture, facades, colors, and shapes, he tries to trigger the viewers’ imagination and unveil a whole new world of details that often go unnoticed by human eyes.    Matthieu Venot started taking pictures in 2009, but it was not until the early part of 2014 that he seriously began working on photography. He left his job as a sound engineer to work on photography projects in and about his hometown of Brest. Belonging to the generation of artists who have gained quite the reputation thanks to social media, Venot’s extraordinarily beautiful and stunning pictures have rapidly created a keen interest amongst the fans of online art. The popularity of his Instagram account with more than 70,000 followers has attracted many different media both in France and abroad, which transmit his photographs and contribute to its diffusion.   Attracted by a rare colour, a different shape or texture, or sometimes shade, Matthieu leaves aside functionality and emphasizes the aesthetic value of the buildings and their integral parts. The phantasmagorical quality is built by the artist's choice of bright color palettes and luminous lines that convey the calmness and steadiness. Since Venot’s start in 2009, his outstanding and geometric photographs have expanded to show other cities in France and throughout the globe. The artist is represented by Artistics Gallery.  ",135
John Goodyear,"A celebrated Op artist, John Goodyear created a substantial body of work that lends itself to both reflection on the inner self and discovery of the outside world. Throughout his career spanning over six decades, he re-contextualized the viewer’s present observation through painting, drawing, light, optics, installation, and heat. Born in Los Angeles in 1930, Goodyear won a full-tuition scholarship to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, graduating with a Bachelor in Design in 1952. While serving two years in Japan during WWII, he got acquainted with Japanese architecture and Zen Buddhism that led to the sparse ambiguity that would go on to characterize his work. “Art makes one see, what one sees makes art,” Goodyear once said. In the late 1950s, he began to paint in the three-dimension, resulting in works that fluctuate between painting and sculpture, engaging the viewer to participate. His later works were comprised of open grids behind which hangs a canvas, which would be activated by the touch of the hand or a walk-by to create optical movement, illusions of perspective, and shimmering colors.

Gerald Williams,"By developing a specific form of Pointillism, and connecting art to broader social struggles, American visual artist Gerald Williams gained prominence as a crucial figure in the Black Arts Movement and a founding member of the influential artist group AfriCOBRA. On the border of abstraction and figuration, his polyrhythmic work explores the issues of identity, culture, and place from a global perspective. Today Williams’ work is part of several major public collections, including the Brooklyn Museum, DuSable Museum of African American History, the Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago, and the DeYoung Museum.   Williams studied at the Woodrow Wilson Junior College for a year, then served in the Air Force for two years. After returning to Chicago in 1966, the artist simultaneously attended night classes at Harold Washington College and drawing and design classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. Eventually, he earned his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Chicago State University in 1969 and a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting from Howard University in 1976. Alongside his artistic practice, Williams served in the Peace Corps, acted as a teacher in the public school systems of Chicago and Washington, D.C., and served as an Arts and Crafts Center Director for the United States Air Force. Together with Jae Jarrell, Wadsworth A. Jarrell, Barbara J. Jones and Jeff Donaldson, Williams founded in 1968 AfriCOBRA art collective that became instrumental in defining and exploring the black visual aesthetic. Inspired by city life, they began incorporating different elements into their artistic expression, such as bright colors of people’s wardrobes and lettering seen on the streets.   Williams is a great admirer of the concept “mimesis at midpoint,” which he has strived to emulate in his work throughout his career. The middle ground between the abstraction and the absolute likeness is where the artist feels most comfortable expressing the essence of reality. Throughout his travels, he opened himself up to new materials and techniques. Not one to settle for comfortable, Williams constantly experiments in order to distill the visual language of place, time, language, and identity. The results are works that possess the polyrhythmic aesthetic that inspires contemplation and dialogue. Inspired by the great masters, specifically Paul Klee, the artist developed a distinctive brand of Pointillism. The technique can be best seen in his early work titled Message from a Giant—Garvey (1976), where faces and shapes pop out of the multicolored patchwork.   Williams has had numerous solo exhibitions throughout his career. He also participated in several group shows at the world’s most prestigious institutions, including the 2019 Venice Biennale Official Collateral Event and Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power at the Tate Modern. The artist celebrated the AfriCOBRA’s fiftieth birthday with an exhibition titled AFRICOBRA 50 at the Kavi Gupta Gallery in Chicago. Gerald Williams lives and works in Chicago, Illinois.",137

Jitka Hanzlova,"A Czech contemporary photographer, Jitka Hanzlová is best known for her portraiture. Shot in vertical format in distant parts of the world, each of her images has a bearing on the relationship of the individual with the context in which that person lives. Born in 1958 in Nachod, Czechoslovakia, Hanzlová claimed asylum in Germany in 1982 and settled in Essen, where she currently lives and works. She studied photography and communication technology at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen. She created her first series Rokytnik between 1990 and 1994, documenting the village inhabitants of the photographer's homeland. She is a recipient of numerous awards, including Paris Photo Prize for Contemporary Photography, France, Grand Prix Award – Project Grant 2003, Arles, France, and European Photography Award 1995, Germany. Her work is featured in numerous collections, such as Fotomuseum Winterthur, Winterthur, Switzerland, Museum of Modern Art, New York, National Galleries of Scotland and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA. Having experienced the trauma of fleeing her native home of Czechoslovakia in 1982, the artist focuses on the ways in which one’s homeland and surrounding environment shape identity. Using surprisingly varied subject matter, she photographs all of her subjects in a sensitive and meditative way. Her works are imbued with complexity, reflecting the intricacies of life. ",140

Terry Winters,"Terry Winters is an American painter and printmaker influenced by minimalism and non-narrative abstraction and his work represents various organic shapes, tangled forms and abstracted images of plants and flowers. At the same time, his painting are unique artistic references to scientific processes. Winters is interested in biology, chemistry, mineralogy and natural pigments and his art aims at exploring these areas in an unconventional and intuitive way. Winters’ work  has become more detailed over time, but his process of preparing the materials for his paintings remained intact – almost like a scientist, Winter is always doing a small research before the actual process of painting  and assembling collages of references.   Winters was born in Brooklyn, NY and studied at the prestigious Pratt Institute. He graduated in 1971, with a BFA in fine arts. Already as a student, Winters was interested in minimalism and wanted to explore for himself the reductive tendencies of the contemporary art. He was very diligent in his study and also quite secretive, because he was working silently for ten years after his graduation, not showing his work to anyone except to a small group of fellow artists. At the same time, he was collecting and reading books on pigments, biology, and mineralogy, because he wanted his art to explore the metaphoric potential of natural processes and materials. In the late 1970s, Winters already excelled in his study of pigments and his focus turned to creating spatial illusions in paintings. This time, he wanted to learn how to give a certain three-dimensionality to non-representational forms. This new interest of Winters’ is clearly visible in his paintings from the 80s, which are featuring complex and tangled paths, with the goal of creating the sense of depth.   Rich colorful patterns are common for the entire Winters' body of work. His paintings consist of many layers and intersecting or blending patterns . He often begins his artworks with the combination of interfering structures – for example, he combines wavy lines and strict grids, or helixes and grids. The transparency of his oil paints and the simplicity of his colors are some of the main characteristics of his work. Also, this limited palette of colors is allowing Winters to avoid the impression of chaos, no matter how complicated are his patterns. Winters is creating a very specific chaos – calm, controlled and constrained chaos. Almost like a mathematician Winters is carefully planning his brushstrokes and choice of colors,but at the same time, he leaves enough space for uncertainties and surprises.   Winters drawings and paintings have been shown at numerous solo and group exhibitions so far, including the important retrospective Whitney Museum of American Art,  Irish Museum of Modern Art and the prestigious show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He often works with a couple of fellow artists, like Tony Cragg and Stephen Mueller, who are having the similar interest in organic abstraction and the impact of modern technologies on artistic tendencies. Winters' work has gone through a perceptible evolution since the 90s, which can be easily spotted on his most recent artworks. Nowadays the artist tends to shift from large to small scale works, his compositions are looser and his forms more ambiguous. Along the same lines, the typical architectural grids he used the use in the past are gone or ended up completely abstracted. However, Winters’ main source of inspiration are still the natural sciences and information systems.   Winters has been creating his puzzling abstract paintings inspired by the natural processes for longer than 30 years now and his easily recognizable bio-forms, such as cellular structures, molecules, plants and shellfish became his trademark motifs. What is even more interesting is the fact that Winters never stopped growing as an artist and after he achieved a worldwide success, he continued to explore the abstract minimalism and turned away from the tangible even more, guided by the digital technology advances. Winters’ interest in exploring space and challenging himself in unconventional ways has extended to installation nowadays, offering even more exciting material for his audience.  ",143
Bruno Munari,"Italian artist Bruno Munari was foremost an inventor whose contributions were instrumental in further developments of visual arts, such as sculpture, film, painting, architecture, and graphic design. The artist had exceptional creativity in the fields of creativity, games, tactile learning, kinesthetic learning, and games. He was an author of numerous children's books and a passionate poet. During his versatile career spanning seven decades, Munari was a recipient of numerous awards, including the Gold Medal from the Milan Triennale for Libri Illeggibili, Lego award, four ADI Compasso d'Oro, and was named by Picasso the “new Leonardo Da Vinci”.   The 1920’s in Italy were a time when the Futurist movement was slowly embracing the ideology of Surrealism and leaving behind Constructivism. Bruno Munari (born 1907, Milan) quickly became friends with prominent artists of the movement, including Prampolini, Depero, and Lescovich, with whom he participated in several group shows in Europe. In 1929 he began collaborating with the fellow artist Riccardo Castagnedi (Ricas), with whom he co-owned the publishing and graphic studio. Most works from this period were signed R + M. Munari worked for many magazines designing photo montages and covers and was an art director for Grazia and Tempo Magazine. During the trip to Paris, he became friends with artists André Breton and Louis Aragon. During this busy and productive period of the artist's career, he published Le Macchine di Munari (Munari’s Machines), his first book.   Bruno Munari created the Macchina area (Aerial machine), the first-ever Mobile art. The artworks he named the Macchine Inutili (Useless Machines), the artist exhibited in numerous Futurist group exhibitions. These abstract moving creations brought him recognition in the artistic circles. Unlike static painting, the artworks were light, evoking movement and interacting in space. With these truly revolutionary pieces, Munari shifted towards Constructivism, aiming to transform the environment in which they operated. The artist slowly separated himself from Italian Futurism because of their close connections with Fascism and together with artists Atanasio Soldati, Gillo Dorfles, and Gianni Monnet founded the Movimento Arte Concreta (M.A.C.) in 1948. This was a very productive period for Munari, for he began creating objects for industry, such as ashtrays, toys, televisions, light fixtures, and espresso machines.     The multidisciplinary artist was also a successful painter, whose works were shown in countless galleries throughout Italy and Europe, including Palazzo Reale (the Royal Palace), and the 17th Venice Biennale. With the MAC Bruno Munari began work on the series of paintings titled Negativo-Positivo. These two-dimensional works evoked the feeling of movement, which he achieved by blurring the lines between the background and the subject. The artist constantly experimented with photocopier machines and cinema, such as his short film titled Tempo nel tempo. Munari kept working until his death in 1998. In later years he dedicated all his time to children's workshops, creating toys, sculptures, paintings, and writing children books that featured the new technique of kinesthetic learning.

He teaches in the Department of Painting and Drawing at OCADU. In his practice, Rucklidge combines traditional romanticism and the 21st century industrial design, inscribing his grand sublime landscapes with graphic diagrams and architectural skeins. Characterized by a cold, hard and calculating undertone, his painting seem almost apocalyptic. ",145
Jacquelyn Thunfors,"Jacquelyn Thunfors is a Swedish-American journalist, artist, and educator, who began painting upon realizing at midlife that words have their limit. The possibility of drawing an idea or making it out of clay nudged her towards an art career. These ideas arrive from outer space, and if they refuse to go away and demand visibility, she will begin working on them, making all the necessary parts as she goes along. Thunfors is always trying to invent an innovative ride worth the time of her viewers. The color choices are instinctive, without any influence from the conscious. Her goal is not to produce a painting – rather it’s reaching the viewer. At that moment, both the artist and her audience are able to share the joy of existence itself from a mutual point of view.

Stefana McClure,"An Irish visual artist, Stefana McClure focuses on discrepancies in translation, fascinated by the gray area that exists between languages and cultures. Her process of translation involves transforming text and printed materials into sculptural objects, often through laborious processes like knitting, cutting, wrapping, and tracing. Born in 1959 in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Stefana McClure grew up in Belfast during ""the Troubles"", an ethno-nationalist period of conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted about 30 years from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. This has much influenced her work. She graduated in 1984 with a BA in Sculpture from Hornsey College of Art in London before moving to Japan for twelve years. There she completed post-graduate studies in paper making at Kyoto Seika University having won the Monbusho Scholarship. From there, she moved to New York.

Daniel Arsham,"The elusive point where sculpture, architecture, and performance meet, the place American artist Daniel Arsham calls home, is capable of great inspiration and impression. Always at the edge of art and architecture, experimenting with various approaches and practice, this young colorblind artist has earned the praise of both ordinary museum-goers as well as extravagant show-business stars. His numerable collaborations include projects done with James Franco, Merce Cunningham, Heidi Slimane and Pharrell Williams. He has also received commissions from luxury fashion brands such as Calvin Klein and Louis Viton.  Daniel Arsham was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in Miami. He graduated from the Cooper Union in New York. Interestingly, what first drew him to the subject of architecture was an incident of violent weather in his childhood. Witnessing his childhood home become the wreckage of a hurricane and seeing “what’s inside the walls” impressed upon him a fluid understanding of architecture. His installations play with the boundaries of space and time as the walls themselves become pieces of art, warping and disappearing, oozing over, under and hiding objects and bodies, as staircases lead nowhere and nature overpowers structures. Arsham seems to enjoy a paradoxical, sometimes dystopian, view of the past, present and future, placing us in the proverbial shoes of our ancestors as he encases everyday objects in volcanic ash, seemingly found at a future archeological excavation site. Another staple of his work is the play with negative space, objects seemingly there under a bed sheet or inside the wall, but actually hollow, only their resemblance painted by the solid sculpture of what is usually a soft and flowing fabric.   The trait that sets this quirky artist apart is his color blindness. He can see approximately twenty percent of what a person can normally distinguish. Reflecting this is his art, nearly always lacking color, monochromatic at the most. A recurring symbol is the moon and her black-and-white dance. “In space, there is a lot of black.” – Arsham says. Looking at all of Arsham’s works, a distinct preference for white and gray tones can be noticed. Is he trying to relate his condition through his work? What is certain is that Daniel perceives the world differently than we do, a thing every artist aspires to, even if he wasn’t much aware of it in his early years. He considered his color-blindness a mere fact of life, a small nuisance, or not even a change at all, seeing as his parents never treated him very differently or put much emphasis on his condition. Even so, as an adult, he acknowledges the vast difference in perspectives of people, especially in the case of conditions such as these. He has experimented with correcting his vision through special optical lenses that refract light and allow colorblind people to see more differences between colors, inspiring him to use color for the first time in his 2016 solo exhibition at Galerie Perrotin in New York, titled Circa 2345. Using calcite crystal, a substance richly blue in color, Arsham cast today’s sports items into intensely colored sculptures, including an explorable cavern made entirely of sports balls. Even so, the exhibition hints at the author’s life without color, as no other colors are used but shades of blue and purple.   Daniel got propelled into the world of jet-set when legendary American dance choreographer Merce Cunningham invited him to design the stage for the piece titled eyeSpace at the Miami Performing Arts Center, 2004. Cunningham had previously collaborated with the likes of Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol, and Arsham was to be the youngest artist to collaborate with the choreographer. Even with no training or experience in stage design, he accepted the offer and went on to repeatedly design sets for Cunningham, including her last show before her death in 2009. With news of the collaboration reached other artists, they too began to seek out Daniel's arts and design. What makes Arsham particularly popular among high-profile celebrities is the monochrome palette he uses, attributed to his colorblindness, and the sense of disembodied futurism his works entail. That aesthetic resonates with luxury streetwear aficionados, like Pharell Williams. He met Arsham at a dinner in Miami hosted by Galerie Perrotin, and the two became friends because of a shared fascination with each other’s art. Arsham has cast Williams’s first instrument, a Casio MT-500 keyboard, in volcanic ash, crystal, and steel. “Daniel is the master of illusion and science,” Mr. Williams said in an email. “The metaphors in his work read true to humans. It’s not based upon languages. It’s based upon human reaction and response to his work.”[1] Arsham himself modestly puts what he does as “taking everyday things and playing with expectations”.   Architecture is an ever-present subject throughout his work, an area Arsham likes to explore, bend the rules of and play with. Getting inspiration from everyday scenes, he makes architecture go places it is not supposed to go, confusing our expectations of space and form. Together with artist Alex Mustonen, Arsham established Snarkitecture – a collaboration and experimental practice creating works somewhere in-between art and architecture, trying to answer architecture’s unasked questions and investigate the unknown, resulting in spectacular effects as existing materials, programs and structures are manipulated and reinterpreted. By transforming the everyday into the extraordinary, Snarkitecture offers memorable moments of interaction to their audience. Exploring the boundaries of disciplines, the studio designs permanent, architectural scale projects and functional objects with new and imaginative purposes. The name Snarkitecture is drawn from Lewis Carroll’s The Hunting of The Snark, a poem describing an “impossible voyage of an improbable crew to find an inconceivable creature.”[2] In Daniel Arsham's work, sculpture, architecture and performance blend, creating the surreal. Nothing is what it seems. Through sculpture, drawing, and performance, Arsham challenges our perceptions of physical space, as walls melt or stretch like a piece of fabric in front of our very eyes. Fascinated by the relationship between modern architecture and the natural environment, he looks for inspiration to create the impossible. Daniel Arsham is represented by the Galerie Perrotin in Paris, Hong Kong and New York, as well as Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art Miami and OHWOW from Los Angeles.  References:  ",154
Alan Johnston,"A British contemporary artist, Alan Johnston explores spatial contexts and relations through drawing and architectural construction. As he explained himself, his work reflects ""on the spatial and tactual implications in architecture where perceptual notions are rendered as common factors in sight and touch."" Johnston was born in 1945 in Edinburgh, where he still lives and works. He graduated from Edinburgh College of Art, Royal College of Art, London and Kunstakadamie Dusseldorf. Johnston’s work has been exhibited in a range of venues, including The Von der Heydt Museum, Wuppertal, Bei Konrad Fischer, Düsseldorf, Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, Pier Arts Centre, Stromness, The Fruitmarket, Edinburgh, Jack Tilton Gallery, NYC, Shimada Gallery, Tokyo, Transmission Gallery, Glasgow, Haus Wittgenstein, Vienna, Inverleith House, Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, The National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, The Lisson Gallery, London, The Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, The Whitney Museum, NYC, Galerie Stadtpark, Krems, Tate Gallery, London, Safn Museum, Reykjavik, Centre for Contemporary Art, Osaka, The Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, CT, Slewe Gallery, Amsterdam and The Henry Moore Institute, Leeds. Johnson finds inspiration in the work of Patrick Geddes, Philosophical Generalism, and Gesamtkunstwerk, which serves as a comparative context which has its roots in the practice of art, architecture and visual thinking in the West and the East.

JeeYoung Lee,"JeeYoung Lee (also known as Jee Young Lee or Jee-Young Lee), a South Korean multi-disciplinary artist. Blowing life into her immense need for expression and interrogation, she adds plastic creativity and theatrical performance to the photographic medium. Her inner world is turned into staged photography with the involvement of painting, sculpture, and installation, blurring the boundaries of mediums. Motivated by her quest for personal identity, in each of Lee’s works, the artist is the protagonist. Sometimes facing away from the viewer, sometimes showing only part of her body or reclining, she always quietly and mysteriously inhabits her dream-like realms. Lee’s work is known for its bold patterns and materials, dramatic colors, and intriguing narratives. All of this originates from her 3 x 6 m studio, where she spends weeks and months turning the fabric of the universe born from her mind into a tangible visual experience. To exclude any ulterior photographic alteration, Lee works with infinite minutiae and extraordinary patience. She has created installations in major institutions all around the world, and her photographs can be found in international public collections such as the Kiyosato Museum of Photographic Arts as well as in private collections around the world.

Adrienn Krahl,"Adrienn Krahl’s paintings express a profound sense of drama and emotional weight. Krahl works in a range of mediums, including acrylics, charcoal and ink, blending painterly spontaneity with an architectural approach to structure. The mastery with which she allows each medium to express its unique properties creates the impression of different psychological forces at work within the composition. Though her compositions are completely abstract, the complex, angst- filled tangles of lines, color fields and forms suggest a story is being told. Careful attention to detail yields to an embrace of chaos as different mediums advance and recede, paint casually drips across the surface, and asymmetry gives way to balance. Born in Budapest, Hungary, Krahl studied Art and Design History in London, and currently lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan.     Featured image: Adrienn Krahl - portait. Photo courtesy IdeelArt",159
Sarah J. & Sally A. Edwards,"Sarah J. & Sally A. Edwards are British twin sisters who work as Photographer and Art Director, respectively.

David Hockney,"Watching the paintings of David Hockney is a unique experience of witnessing a whole new creative dimension designed by a man that never followed popular standards and patterns but rather chose to set his own norms and leave the following to others. Hockney is an English painter, printmaker, photographer and stage designer who was an important contributor to the Pop art movement in Britain and remained a crucial figure of modern art scene to this day. He is famed for his stylistic versatility, but unlike most of the fellow artists out there, David never forsake the previous concepts as he was discovering new preferable styles - he would instead build on the previous concepts and expand his impressive creative arsenal. Shortly put, Hockney is undoubtedly one of the most influential British painters of the 20th century.  David Hockney was born in Bradford, England, on the 9th of July of 1937. His parents Laura and Kenneth Hockney eventually had a large family of five kids, with David being the fourth one in a row. Setting the hardships of World War II that were ripping Europe limb from limb on the other side of the La Manche, Hockney had a very happy childhood in his small hometown tucked away in West Yorkshire. He began showing small flashes of artistic brilliance ever since he was a toddler and it didn't take too long for his parents to figure out he should be supported and encouraged to go down the path of artistic creation. Hockney received an immense education at Bradford College of Art and the Royal College of Art in London which in return to his efforts gave him a masterful command over understanding and expressing himself in all matters concerning art. David's spent his college days in London tirelessly making a name for himself and meeting similar minded fellow artists, some of whom will prove to be very crucial for the art scene as well, like the R.B. Kitaj. Nearing the end of his collegiate endeavors at the Royal College of Art, Hockney featured in the exhibition Young Contemporaries alongside Peter Blake - this show is often regarded as the one that announced the arrival of British Pop art, an exhibition which allowed visitors to see what the likes of Hockney and his friends had in store for the future of UK's art. Interestingly enough, David's initial pieces actually revealed flashes of expressionist elements above all, very comparable in nature to the works of Francis Bacon and not too correlated with the concepts of the early Pop art. Nevertheless, David Hockney became a blindingly bright star on the rise and his reputation grew overnight. At one point it seemed as he even became more influential than the actual Royal College of Art, like the time David refused to write an essay required for the final examination, insisting he should be assessed solely on his artworks - the RCA actually changed its regulations and awarded the diploma despite the strict rules.   Even before he became an era-defining artist, Hockney found ways to reintegrate a personal subject-matter into his compositions. The first recognizable sign of such concepts appearing in his work came to be just after he graduated when David started experimenting by copying fragments of poems and placing them on canvas. This not only created a specific individual identity through the alliance of word and image but also encouraged a close scrutiny of the painting surface. These concepts eventually led Hockney to the famed series of paintings produced in 1960/61 that focused on the themes of homosexual love. The next creative step of Hockney's career occurred after a visit to California where he subsequently lived for many years - it motivated and inspired him to make a series of paintings depicting swimming pools in a highly realistic style focusing on the usage of vibrant colors. This radical alteration of David's style was one of the rare instances of changing the very roots of one's art, as he suddenly concentrated on acrylic depictions of athletic young men, swimming pools, palm trees and perpetual sunshine. Hockney spent the 60s and 70s exploring stylistic boundaries and traveling between London and Los Angeles, as well as the beloved Paris which served as a calming retreat. As the early 1980s were passing along, David began to produce photo collages - or joiners as he preferred to call them - which will eventually prove to be an important milestone of his career. Initially using Polaroid prints and subsequently turning to the 35mm commercially-processed color prints, Hockney stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique and see if it allowed more expressive freedom. However, David soon became frustrated with the one-eyed limitations rooted in the very ideas of photography and eventually returned to painting - nevertheless, the joiners were a massive expansion on the creative front and they served him much good in the long run.   Besides doing what every artist does and that is creating for his own imaginative soul, Hockney also worked on many commissions over the years. As he had the commodity to freely choose on what he desired to work, David often accepted the jobs of designing stages and this became one of his trademarks. He worked for the likes of Royal Court Theatre, Glyndebourne, La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, leaving permanent marks in all these prestigious ballet and opera locations and adjusting synesthetic colors in response to musical stimuli - this feat does not appear in his painting or photography artworks, but is a common underlying principle in his designs for stage sets. As the 90s were passing by, David worked extensively with landscapes, depicting different sights with a strong and unnatural coloration - these pieces are considered to be some of the greatest landscape paintings of the 20th century. They are vivid, incredibly composed, imaginative and one hundred percent unique - all of which makes them instantly recognizable. In the year of 2001, Hockney launched a book titled as Secret Knowledge that proved to be a great commercial and critical success. In it, David presented a theory that the Old Masters relied on what he called camera obscura technique - a projection of the image onto the surface of the painting. He stated that this technique migrated gradually from Italy and is the main reason for the revered photo-realistic style of painting we see in the Renaissance and later periods of art. In more recent years, David has been expanding his concepts of colorful depictions, continuing to paint fabulous landscape pieces full of bright and unnatural colors. He also continued to paint realistically, finding a perfect balance between his old photorealistic collage pieces and the younger affinity to landscapes and colors.   While the legendary Andy Warhol was setting the Pop standards on the other side of Atlantic, David Hockney played the exact same role in the British Pop art scene, dictating the very course that served as a guiding star for most English contemporary artists. David was celebrated in the United States as well but fell short in popularity behind the aforementioned Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns as the American trio was simply too successful to be rivaled with. Nevertheless, Hockney was the go-to-guy when it came to British Pop art and undoubtedly made his mark on the European modern art, influencing generations upon generations for decades.

Wolf Kahn,"Although the genre of landscape seems to be underestimated in recent years, the work of Wolf Kahn is a constant reminder of how gentleness and tranquility in hand with peculiar coloring can easily transform the very notion of representations of nature. The narratives Kahn is eager of depicting are suffocated with intense compositional and formal relations which are in service of keeping a fragment of memory to certain place and moment. The final result should be appealing for the observer or rather inviting due to immense contemplative potential his works reflect.    Wolf Kahn was born in 1927, in Stuttgart. He was born in the well-educated family and his father was a musician. Shortly after the Nazi’s reign power in 1933, Kahn's father lost his appointment with the Stuttgart Philharmonic Orchestra due to increasing anti-Semitism. The whole family fled to the US, yet Kahn was sent to live with his grandmother in Frankfurt. The first artistic beginnings of Wolf Kahn can be traced to 1937 when his grandmother signed him up for private art lessons at the age of eleven. He was largely inspired by military pageantry which was an echo of the times. Two years later, his grandmother arranged for him to leave Germany for England to live with a host family, and in 1940 Kahn was able to reunite with his family in New York city.    Young Kahn graduated from the High School of Music and Art in New York in 1945, and later started studied with the renowned teacher and Abstract Expressionist painter  Hans Hofmann. At the  University of Chicago the artist graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950, and was rather determined to become a professional artist. The former Hofmann students including himself established the Hansa Gallery, a cooperative gallery where Wolf Kahn  had his first solo exhibition. In 1956, he joined the Grace Borgenicht Gallery, where he exhibited regularly until 1995.   While in a search for a perfect expression, Kahn embodied various stylistic characteristics spanning from modern abstract of his teacher Hans Hofman, over Matisse’s coloring, to the atmospheric qualities of Impressionism. Wolf Kahn was largely inspired by Edwardian furniture, books, and bronzes of Schiller and Goethe, while at the University of Chicago, he became interested in philosophy, particularly the writings of Immanuel Kant. His plunge into landscape is rooted with the artist’s inner quest for contemplation and tranquil. The astonishing contrasts are usually expressed with oil and pastel, while his convergence of light and color has been described as combination of pictorial landscapes and painterly abstraction.    The depictions of barns, rivers, meadows, and woods appear to be of Kahn’s particular interest. Though representational, the works are abstract and exactly this ambiguity provides them additional layer of meaning. Within his signature palette alizarin crimson, thalo green, and dioxazine purple prevail. Nevertheless, black, white, and yellow have found a bigger presence since Wolf Kahn uses them to accentuate density and specifically texture. The mixing of colors is done optically, so the whole process of preparation, as it is the finalization,  quiet intuitive and largely unconscious.   Throughout the decades, Wolf Kahn has received a number of awards including a Fulbright Scholarship a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, and an Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Wolf Kahn became a member of the National Academy of Design in 1980, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1984. Interestingly, in 2005 the Smithsonian Art Collectors Program commissioned him to produce a print to benefit the cultural and educational programs of the Smithsonian Associates. His works are part of many collections starting from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, to  The Museum of Modern Art, just to mention the most important ones. The fusion of color, spontaneity, and representation which Wolf Kahn employed the best have contributed to the production of an important and expressive body of work.

Donald Sultan,"Great artists always seemingly strive towards perfection, while at the same time hoping they’ll never reach it. Donald Sultan is no different. But, to be perfectly honest, there is no such thing as perfection in the world of art. If it were, that would mean the artworks are devoid of any kind of human qualities, lacking the most imperfect and the most significant part that indeed makes us humans – the emotions. Because, if an art piece is truly perfect, then it wouldn’t stir up feelings within its observers, and thus, it wouldn’t be art. Sultan has an amazing ability to annihilate the indifference in his audience, making them either thoroughly enjoy or dislike his work, with one thing common for all of them – once they’ve seen one of his artworks, they’re going to want to see them all.  Born in an artistic family, Sultan originally shared his mother’s interest in theater, something that she had actively pursued. He learned how to create theatrical sets and also how to paint them while he acted. However, he decided to devote himself to art – a domain where his father was present. Due to fear of not being able to support himself or his family, Sultan senior chose business and owned a tire company, spending his free time painting in Abstract Expressionist mode. After spending his high school years at the Wilbraham Academy in Massachusetts, Sultan enrolled at the University of North Carolina with the intention of studying the theater. And yet, reluctant to take a direction that would set him on the path of becoming an actor, he changed his interests and transferred to the art department, where he earned his BFA in 1973. Two years later, he completed his MFA from the School of Art Institute of Chicago. The artist has received two honorary doctorate degrees – in 2000, from the Corcoran School of Art, Washington D.C., and in 2002, from the New York Academy of Art. His pieces are included in many prestigious public and private collections throughout the world, e.g. Whitney Museum of American Art, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Museum of Modern Art in New York, Tate Gallery in London, The Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, Ludwig Museum Budapest – Museum of Contemporary Art, and many more. Sultan moved to New York in 1975 with the goal of becoming a successful artist, and he supported himself at first by helping other artists in constructing lofts. He would often spend all day doing physical work, which left the nights for his artistic endeavors. After winning the Creative Artists Public Service Grant from the New York State Council on the Arts in 1979, he was finally able to focus all of his time on art.   The artist holds mastery over physical density and is one of the first to use the industrial materials such as tar, spackling plaster, and vinyl tile in his creations. “Anything can be used as a material for making art”. The tar was used particularly often, something that stayed with Sultan since his early years when he watched his father’s tire business. This interest was crystallized during his years in Chicago. With a unique approach to his unusual materials, he applied them as they were tubes of paint, making his work direct, and more importantly – always fresh. The paintings seem to follow a specific formula, where the images are cut, gouged, and burned out of surfaces made of squares of ordinary linoleum tile. Instead on canvas, he works on masonite covered with 12-inch floor tiles. The artist cut the desired shapes into the vinyl, fills in the cutout space with tar and/or plaster, before painting over it, which gives the entire thing an extraordinarily rich texture. When these two filler materials abut, the plaster is sometimes tinged with a hint of the tar, creating an instantaneous chiaroscuro effect. The train wrecks, silhouetted factories, forest fires, and harbor scenes are emphasized when the artist wipes thin billows of tar across expanses of uncut linoleum, resulting in a toxic smokiness. A lot of his early works were about the juxtaposition between rigidity and gesture, with all of that dark imagery being really about the architecture in the paintings. The pieces seem very strong and massive, with the element of permanence, but nothing is permanent as the artist hid the meaning of everything that his paintings contained in the extremely fragile image in the front.   Still-life is one the most familiar subjects in the history of art, but Sultan makes a good case that it’s still a fertile ground for further exploration. His choice of the subject matter certainly isn’t radical, but a still-life piece can surprise and open new possibilities when it’s approached with a striking technique. Similarly, Sultan’s before-mentioned chiaroscuro effect creates elegant images where his selected forms are flattened on the pictorial plane. Speaking of forms, he constantly returns to the pears, apples, and lemons, but not literally. His still-life projects are exclusively about putting the imagery back into the abstract, and while the pieces possess an undeniable element of realism, it is far from his original intention. The arrangement of domestic objects means that they can be held in hand, moved without limitations in order to become a composition. Some features of the great masters from the past can be noticed in the Sultan’s work – as the 16th-century Dutch still-life was an emblematic art of material plenty, meticulous and triumphal, but always in an assertion of time’s scythe. The dark note present in this era originates even further into the past, when Greek’s and Roman’s mosaic art first snared the familiar domesticated things, laying them out in a flattened space. Peter Aertsen, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hans Memling, Caravaggio (with his revolt against the lavishness of the Roman Church which is seen in the simplicity of his Basket of Fruit), Zurbaran, Rubens, Chardin, and many later artists that occupied the realm of still-life have inspired Sultan, but there is something unique in his work. It doesn’t necessary implies that difference in technique and materials is responsible for this uniqueness; it is probably based on the intention of going into abstraction, but as the artist explains, some of the pieces that look most abstract are indeed those who are the most realistic.   Floral imagery has been a part of Sultans’s oeuvre for over 40 years. Back in the 1970s, he began to see the urban environment as a source for new growth. The fact that no one in his generation was painting flowers helped in making it one of his most recognizable features. He is most famous for the paintings of tulips and for some massive poppy works that extend far beyond the familiar address of similar subjects that preceded them. Remaining faithful to his process, Sultan covers the vinyl-tile surfaces with the tar on which he draws his celebrated poppy images. These floral forms are then excavated and filled with a drywall mud, that, when cured, is painted with vividly hued enamels. A black rayon flocking is introduced next, with the texture reminiscent of the pollen on the anthers at a poppy’s heart. The abstract ground is created in the torching the surrounding areas of tile, gouging and scraping in order to produce rhythmically obsessive vertical striations into their surfaces. Sultan’s gargantuan semi-abstract paintings of fruits and flowers are results of the merging between the Western traditions of still-life painting and the process art, which is, by far, his strongest quality and the basis for the majority of the pieces.    While extremely successful and famous as a painter, Sultan also works in drawing, printmaking, and sculpture. The lithography, wood cut, linocut, etching, serigraphy are in his printmaking scope, with aquatint etchings large in scale being technically extremely complex. He belongs to a small group of American artists who have frequently collaborated with none other than Aldo Crommelynck, who was Picasso’s master printer. Sultan’s etchings emulate soft-edge charcoal drawings, and to make them, he had to work out a method of blowing and brushing the resin powder on printing plate before heating it. For his immensely popular black lemons, he blew through long tubes and used delicate Japanese brushes to blur the edges of shapes. In his drawings, the artist remains in the realm of nature, where the themes and forms of flowers and fruits are explored through silhouetted charcoal drawings on paper and his compositions in color conte crayon and flock. The results are monochromatic and prominent images. The combination of various industrial materials appears in the process of sculpting as well. Other than the familiar and unorthodox materials he uses in his paintings, Sultan tackles the challenges of sculpture by using the usual stuff like wood, iron, lead, and painted aluminum. He is also quite active in the world of written word. Even before graduation, he wanted to start a publication of artists writing about their own work. It was intended to be a trade publication where every year or two years artist from around the USA would write about their recent work so everyone could read it and be acquainted with their thoughts and artworks. The first book was named the Namebook one, and it featured some extremely talented people such as Richard Artschwager, Barbara Kruger, and Ron Gorchov. Sadly, the second one never came out. Nevertheless, Sultan didn’t turn his back on the writing, and his collaborations with David Mamet resulted in the books titled Warm and Colder in 1989, and Bar Mitzvah in 1999, for which he created a series of drawings.    Image after image, Sultan inevitably circles back to his formal technical abilities to craft lovely and beautiful paintings, drawings, prints, and sculptures, by using unusual materials and their combinations. While it’s not so rare to find an artist who has discarded canvases and paint for enamel, tar, and tiles, it is rare to find one that pushes and explores further than many before him. With no signs of stopping, Sultan has reached the age of artistic maturity which, in combination with his talent and clear vision, provides almost endless possibilities for expression. He is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art in Miami, Puccio Fine Art in New York, Weng Contemporary in Zug, Puccio Fine Art in Water Mill, Kunzt Gallery and Galerie Fluegel-Roncak in Nuremberg.

Theo Tobiasse,"Théo Tobiasse was born in Israel in 1927. Originally from Lithuania, his family hoped to find the promised land there. The work of this artist is pervaded with the themes of exile, of the woman as a mother and a lover and of reminiscences of his childhood in Lithuania, as his parents had to move back there. ",167
Chen Fei,"A Chinese contemporary artist, Chen Fei is widely known and appreciated for his narrative paintings, fantasized, often perverted, constructs transposing elements from his personal life into either surrealistic or hyperrealistic pastiches. Born in 1983 in Hong Tong, Shanxi Province, China, Fei was trained at the Beijing Film Academy, and in 2005, he graduated from Fine Arts Department. His extensive knowledge of movies has influenced his choice of subjects and compositional style in his paintings. His overall aesthetics is also influenced by mainstream culture, most notably manga and anime.  Fei’s works are intelligent and mischievous. Characterized by a remarkably sharp sense of black humor informs his vibrant, ego-centered visions divert the age-old tradition of self-portraiture, revisiting Eastern and Western art-historical canons. His works are envisioned as film stills, imbued with a highly graphic quality and detail-oriented style. His pastel-colored universe accordingly mixes the old and new, as well as the hip and traditional painting tropes such as nudes, still lives, portraits and interiors proliferate. At the same time, his work questions and challenges China's collective taste and societal evolution amidst its rapid economic growth.  ",168
Joannis Avramidis,"Joannis Avramidis was a contemporary Greek-Austrian sculptor whose career was marked by the search for the ""absolute figure"". He was inspired by the classical antiquity and the Italian Renaissance, allowing the borders between abstraction and figurative depiction to merge in his sculptures. His works were characterized by softly rounded curves which only suggested the human body without defining it. One of the most important protagonists of Austrian sculpture, Avramidis mainly worked with bronze according to plaster models, later applying the synthetic resin, or massive aluminum as well as copper and other materials. Even in its maximum state of abstraction, his works maintain a reference to human shape and posture, with physical features assigned through a stylized, horizontal segmentation. However, he focused not on the silhouette, but the “inner space of the body“ – a strongly compressed and condensed body which produces a compact form. In the 1960s, he increasingly began depicting bodies in movement, examining its dynamics. Avramidis studied in Batumi and later at Fritz Wotruba in Vienna, as a student of Robin Christian Andersen and Fritz Wotruba. He became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and from 1966 in Hamburg. In 1962, he represented Austria at the Venice Biennale. ",169
Arvid Boecker,"Arvid Boecker is a German abstract painter whose work mobilizes the tensions and harmonies that exist between color relationships, textures, and the processes of time. Boecker studied art history at the University of Trier from 1987-89, and studied at the University of Fine Arts Saar, Saarbrücken, from 1989-94. He has completed residencies at ACME Studios London, Katwijk aan Zee, NL, and Kilmuir, Isle of Skye, GB.  Boecker begins each new work by penciling in his composition. But the work ultimately is about the colors and layers that will evolve on the surface over time.  He builds his paint up in a slow process, adding layers of color then partially removing them, allowing the echoes of erosion to remain visible in the final work. The screen printing squeegees he employs add their unique impressions to the surface, mixing the visual language of painting with that of printing. The gradual accumulation of pigment conveys a visual sense of depth, while also communicating a bittersweet emotional feeling that time is passing. The longer one stares at the surface, the further inward the mind may wander towards the underlying landscapes of color and light.  Boecker derives inspiration from opposing forces he perceives in the visual world. He brings out harmonies and tensions between light and dark hues, and between fields of unbroken color and worn down layers. He finds guidance for the next painting from the final state of his previous painting. The idea that his progressions unfolding in a series lets creative momentum build from one composition to the next. Through the comparisons he makes between each work and the last he comes to understand what makes each painting unique. He is also interested in cycles, gradual forces, and the pressures they exert. While constructing his images he is not frivolous, but rather thoughtful and repetitious, building and layering. This method is born of an appreciation for natural rhythms, and a desire to emulate the elemental aspects of nature.  Professor Hans Gercke of the Academy of Fine Arts, Saarbrucken, Germany wrote about Boecker's work:  Boecker has exhibited extensively in solo and group exhibitions, including at White Cube Gallery, New York, Gallery p13, Heidelberg, ART Cologne, Factory 49, Sydney, NIAD Art Center, Richmond, CA, and Factory 49, Sydney.

Robert Rauschenberg,"Having the great impact on late 20th century visual culture, Robert Rauschenberg was one of the central figures in the development of post-war American art. His works bridge the gap from Abstract Expressionism to later modern movements. As a part of Neo-Dada movement, his innovative approach expanded the former boundaries opening the possibilities of experimentation for further artists. Although considered as a renegade of the 50’s, his predecessors and contemporaries showed a great respect for him. Unlike them, Rauschenberg decided to move forward with the new idea of art that repeated the earlier Dada postulates. His innovative theories and new approach to the definition of a work of art and the artist’s role have moved from a conceptual perspective that considered mark of the brushstroke as a reflection of the artist’s inner world toward employment of both traditional media and found objects, following his belief that painting is related to “both art and life”. His pieces are between these two realms and in constant and indispensable dialogue with the viewers.   Born as Milton Rauschenberg in 1925, in Port Arthur, Texas, he grew up in the family of Fundamentalist Christians and it was quite normal that he planned to become a minister. As an avid and skilled dancer, he gave up this idea when he realized that the church considers dancing for a sin. He also drew a lot, copying images from comics, but nobody took seriously his talent. In accordance with the wish of his parents, he attended the University of Texas at Austin where he studied pharmacology. After refusing to dissect the frog, he was expelled and the letter that arrived at the same time calling him to join army actually saved him from the announcement about an early end of his student days. Rejecting the idea of killing people on the battlefield, he served as a medical technician in the Navy Hospital where they cared for the survivors in San Diego.  After the war, he started his painting studies at the Kansas City Art Institute and at the Academie Julian in Paris where he met his future wife, Susan Weil. He changed his name from Milton to Robert, because he thought it sounded more artistic. From 1949 to 1950 he attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina, under one of the Bauhaus artists, Josef Albers whose courses were based on strict discipline deprived of experiments. Great artist was a harsh critic of his student’s work, but his course on materials where he taught them to explore the line, texture, and color of common materials left a mark on Rauschenberg’s assemblages. Later, Rauschenberg described his teacher as a respectful man influencing him to do exactly the reverse as his departure point in the world painting.   During the first two years of the 50’s, spending his academic years at the Art Students League in New York and summers at the Black Mountain College his ambition has increased so much that provide him a prestigious solo show at the betty Parsons Gallery in New York where he showed his series of White Paintings (1953). Robert Rauschenberg started to use the roller for the application of the white house paint onto his canvases that were under deliberate influence of their surroundings, reflecting every change of shadows. At the same time, Rauschenberg was explored the black as the total opposite and his Black Paintings (1951) were painted with the thick layers of paint, but with the implementation of newspaper scraps. Some of the major influences occurred during his stay at the Black Mountain College, referring to his encounter with minimalist composer John Cage and the choreographer Merce Cunningham who were the teachers there. They both have been the supporters of the use of chance methods, found objects and common experiences within high art. His early works relied on Pop Art and from the late 50’s he used the newspaper and magazine photographs in his paintings inventing the method of transferring images directly onto the canvas with solvent. Using the silk-screen stencil technique that would later be adopted by Andy Warhol, he created refined compositions inspired by the themes from modern American History and popular culture.  In fall 1952, Rauschenberg was divorced and after the Weil took their son and left to live with her parents, the artist decided to travel Europe and North Africa with Cy Twombly, his colleague from the Art Students League and intimate partner. That was the time when he made his first assemblage from the junk he found in the Italian countryside. His return to the United states was followed by further experiments in painting, with the red color this time. Resembling the Black paintings, the Red series (1953) also had the various surface textures with the implemented newspaper’s sheets. Improving and upgrading his experiments, he started to include new objects, from parasols to parts of a man’s undershirts. Rauschenberg coined the name of his innovative works, calling them combines because they represent the mixture of paint and practically sculpture on the canvas. His field of action also included photography, printmaking, and performance. Gathering garbage from the streets of New York, Rauschenberg implemented those found object into his work, giving them a new meaning. Combines refer to his work from 1954 to 1962, but he combined both painting and different objects throughout his career. At the end of 1953, Rauschenberg met the young painter Jasper Johns and two years later they started to live together, becoming romantic and artistic partners. Compared to the relationship that Pablo Picasso had with Georges Braque, two artists spent their time exchanging ideas and encouraging their mutual exploration that moved the boundaries of the known in art. They shared the same philosophy that shaped Neo-Dada style, adopting the accidental beauty in everyday life instead of the coded psychology of Abstract Expressionism. An increasing popularity of Jasper Johns, his face on the cover of Art News magazine and MoMA’s purchase of his paintings caused the jealousy and tension between the pair that resulted in final ending of their relationship in 1961.    Always interested in new technologies, Rauschenberg co-founded Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.) in 1966, with the aim of encouraging the collaboration between the scientists and artists. By this time, his name already became respected within the art world. His American fame was followed by the European, after the exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery in London and Venice Biennale in 1964 when he won the first prize for painting, the first one assigned to an American. In 1965 he created one of his most famous pieces A Modern Inferno designed for Life Magazine in the occasion of the celebration of Dante’s seven-hundredth birthday. The 70’s represented a comeback of assemblages that used same techniques and imagery as earlier but now in the combination with more color and on a larger scale. During the 80’s Rauschenberg was engaged in traveling and spreading the idea that art could change the society, founding the Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (R.O.C.I.) for that purpose. He visited primarily Communist countries, in spite of current American Cold War policies organizing exhibitions of his work inspired by the host country.    Engaged in a reassessment of the definition of the artwork and role of the artist, making the turn from a conceptual outlook where artistic authenticity lied in the artist’s inner world towards interaction with popular media and mass-products that reflected artistic vision, his work ranges somewhere between the art and life, his pieces questioned the relation of artistic and everyday objects. In 1996 Rauschenberg went on a rehabilitation from alcoholism which deteriorated his health. A few years later he broke his hip which led to a stroke and the paralyzing of his right side. Still, he learned to use his left hand which enabled him to work until his death on May 12, 2008, from heart failure. Later modern movements were directly influenced by the Robert Rauschenberg’s work of the 50’s and 60’s. His combines and silkscreen printing experiments led to the further development of the same techniques by the hand of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. His Dada-based theories about the definition of art helped the foundation of Conceptual art, later performances had a source in his collaboration with John Cage and his tendency to borrowing images from popular media and fine art influenced postmodern aesthetic of appropriation. In 1990, he initiated the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation (RRF) with the aim of promoting humanitarian issues. Today, his Foundation possess his works from every period. Robert Rauschenberg's work is represented by Galerie Thalberg, Zurich, Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art, Miami, Pace Gallery, Bejing, Pace Gallery, Hong Kong, Pace Gallery, London, Pace Gallery, Menlo Park and Woodward Gallery, New York.

Peter Doig,"A leader of his generation, Peter Doig is a Scottish artist who was able to propose a new set of questions and alter the way we understand art. In a time when new techniques were dominating and when painters and painting, in general, were considered quaintly anachronistic, he forged a new painterly language: an ironic mix of Romanticism and post-impressionism to create haunting landscape vistas. Well known for the exotic atmospheres and dreamy narratives that appear in his work, executed in an uncommonly rich color palette and with a unique material sensibility, Doig has created some of the most resonant and evocative images in contemporary painting, placing him among the most inventive painters working today. But he’s more than ‘just’ a creator - he is also a sophisticated visual thinker, endlessly preoccupied with the process and history of painting.  On 17 April 1959, Peter Doig, one of the most renowned living figurative painters, was born in Edinburgh. In 1962, he relocated to Trinidad with his family, and four years later, to Canada. At 17, he dropped out of school to work on oil rigs in the prairies, a chastening experience during which he began drawing seriously for the first time. Having decided to get himself educated in art, he chose London, home of his favorite punk bands, moving there in 1979. He attended a foundation course at Wimbledon School of Art and studied at St Martin’s School of Art, where the prevailing lyrical abstraction caused him to react and rebel against it. The painter received his MA from the Chelsea School of Art in 1990. In the mid-1980s, he lived in Montreal and had a studio in London. He worked as a dresser (a part-time job) at the English National Opera in 1989. As an artist, he achieved wide acclaim and recognition in the mid-1990s, both nationally and internationally. In 2000, Doig was invited to return to Trinidad, to take up artist’s residency. He permanently moved to the island in 2002 and set up a studio at the Caribbean Contemporary Arts Center near Port of Spain. He also became a professor at the Fine Arts Academy in Düsseldorf, Germany. A year later, he started a weekly film club, StudioFilmClub with a Trinidadian artist Che Lovelace. His part in the studio is, besides choosing and screening the films, painting posters advertising the week’s film.[1]   Speaking quietly, Doig appears at once shy and commanding, expressing himself through flurries of words and ideas, exuding a sense of inner sureness about the value of what he does. He also seems equally interested in both figure and landscape. Some of the landscapes are abstract while others are influenced by the snowy scenes of his childhood in Canada. Most often, however, his work originates in some sort of cinematic of photographic sources. His uncanny ability to pour his emotions and intuition in these allows him to end somewhere else. The result is an artwork with an incredible amount of painterly energy and an enormous depth. “You try to create scenarios and atmospheres in your paintings. I don’t set out to be deliberately sinister, but I always wanted to make paintings that told stories and suggested things.”[2] As mentioned above, in a time when painting appeared increasingly irrelevant compared to other contemporary artistic trends, Doig stubbornly rose as a painter whose enigmatic images of abandoned houses, frozen forests and lone figures in canoes seemed to champion traditional painterly values – colour, texture, space – while bringing to them a sense of unease that feels very much of our time. And indeed, looking at his quintessential work The Architect’s Home in the Ravine, with its lattice of foliage breaking up the surface of the artwork, one might feel unsure whether what he/she’s looking at is figurative or ultimately abstract. Plainly in view but physically inaccessible, the work is half obliterated with an underbrush as dense as a half-finished Pollock and the scene becomes foreboding: something out of an Edward Hopper or an Andrew Wyeth artwork. In short, Peter Doig reinvented the way a picture is meant to be looked at. In our visual culture, we’re used to reading pictures – we read the information. Whether they’re on the Internet, on Television, or in the papers, we only read information – but in the case of Doig’s pieces, we sympathize with them. Coming to an ordinary exhibition, people will simply walk by the works, giving them all a fragment of their attention. At Doig’s exhibitions, the spectators don’t walk through it. They sit in front of the pieces, immersing themselves in them. And it is this immersion – the idea of the picture focusing on our existence because it is out of focus that makes his paintings so utterly fascinating.  [caption id=""attachment_313246"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""850""]  Peter Doig - Cabin Essence, 1993-4 - image via artnews.com[/caption]  Apart from personal experiences, his inspiration comes from movie scenes, record album covers, newspaper clippings, and works of artists like Edvard Munch, Claude Monet, and Gustav Klimt. While his works are based on photographs (sometimes found, sometimes his own) his style can’t be categorized as and is not photorealism. His series of paintings, created in the late 1990s, allude from where his inspiration is coming from. Country-Rock (Wing-Mirror) (1999), a piece that depicts a tunnel, on which an unknown artist, for more than two decades has painted a rainbow, which authorities were constantly trying to remove, is a familiar landmark in Toronto, which confirms the influence that Canadian scenery left on him. To this also points his use of canoes in his practice, which are freight symbol of Canada. His use of unusual color combinations, and presenting scenes from unexpected angles, contribute to magic realistic feel that his art leaves to the viewer. To enter Doig’s imagery is to enter a dream world, a dream-like universe. The images, according to the artist himself, come to him in the state between being awake and falling asleep. His paintings deal in reflections, and it’s a recurrent feature. There are things between depth and the viewers that look like a dirt on the lens, or we have an impression that something is in our eyes – only to realize that it is delicately painted snow or branches. In many ways, the painting is a medium that requires time for its observers to move through it. Looking at Doig’s works is like traveling – and many of them reflect travels. Pretty much all of them deal with what the viewers perform in front of them. They look at the pieces to find out if it is a reflection of them. Doig has a very distinctive style, as he creates images so intense that they possess the power to suck the observers in, expanding their world, what they have experienced and what they know.    Doig had many exhibitions over the years. His major solo exhibitions would include exhibitions at Tate Britain (2008), Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, Dallas Museum of Art (2005), Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich (2004), Bonnefanten Museum, Maastricht (2003), and Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1998). His first solo exhibition since 2008, was in 2012 when he inaugurated Michael Werner Gallery’s new location in London’s Mayfair. Until 2013, he didn’t had major exhibitions in his home country. First major one was titled No Foreign Lands and took place at Scottish National Gallery, in Edinburgh, from 3 August to 3 November 2013. There he showed works he created in the past decade, much of which the artist spent in Trinidad. Often tropical in their subject matter, these are paintings of intense color on a monumental scale.[3]  Doig received Whitechapel Artist Prize in 1991, shortly after his graduation from the Chelsea School of Art. In 1993, he won the first prize at the John Moores exhibition with his painting Blotter. In 1994, he was nominated for the Turner Prize. The winner was the popular sculptor Antony Gormley, while other nominees were video artist Northern Irish-born Willie Doherty, whose work The Only Good One Is A Dead One was the first video piece to be nominated for the prize and multi-media Shirazeh Houshiary. From 1995 to 2000, he was a trustee of the Tate Gallery. He was honored with amfAR’s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS in 2009. The painter had some formidable auction results in the past. His painting, titled White Canoe, was sold at Sotheby’s for $11.3 million in 2007, which was a record at the time for a living European artist. Night Playground (1997–98), sold in 2009 by Joel Mallin, a New York collector, went for $5 million at a Christie’s auction in London (the estimate was $3 million). The Architect’s Home in the Ravine (1991) also at Christie’s London, was auctioned at £7.66 million. Jetty, a 1994 canvas of a lone figure on a dock at sunset, was sold by a César Reyes (a psychiatrist who is one of the artist’s biggest collectors) for $11.3 million. In 2014, his Gasthof reached $17,038,276 at the Christie’s auction. A year later, his painting Swamped, depicting a canoe in a moonlit lagoon, has fetched nearly $26m (£16.6m) at a record-breaking auction in the US.[4]   Recently, Peter Doig has been a subject of an extremely bizarre lawsuit that was followed by a film-like and even more bizarre trial. Former Canadian prison official Robert Fletcher claimed that he had bought a certain painting from the artist forty years ago. He insisted that the painting was bought from Doig for $100 in 1976 when the artist was serving a sentence for LSD possession at Thunder Bay Correctional Centre in Ontario, where Fletcher worked at the time. Yet, the painting was signed “Pete Doige 76”. After Fletcher tried to sell the work, Doig disavowed of it claiming he had never painted it. Fletcher and the art dealer filed a lawsuit against him for interfering with the sales and plummeting the painting’s worth. What followed was a weird trial where artist’s claims and former whereabouts were put to question.  Doig claimed he had never been in prison and that he had been attending high school in Ontario at the time, but Fletcher insisted that the records of the prison sentence were erased not to jeopardize the artist’s career. Additionally, the artist stated the signature was not his, that he hasn’t been painting on canvas at the time and that he has never painted a single painting in acrylic, as this one was. After an agonizing cross-examining, the judge ruled that it was a case of mistaken identity.[5] There was a certain Peter Edward Doige who has spent time in Thunder Bay during the 1970s who have died in 2012, and his sister confirmed it was, in fact, the work of her late brother. This was certainly a quite unique and bizarre case, as this was the first time that the living artist had to fight such accusations, as it is widely accepted that their word concerning the authenticity of a work is final. The justice finally prevailed for Peter Doig.   Doig’s works are being sold for record-breaking amounts at auctions. And while sometimes the market makes mistakes, overpricing certain creators and their pieces, there isn’t such a mistake present in the case of Peter Doig. People who buy his creations are assured they will survive the test of time and are willing to invest in sheer quality. Why wouldn’t they be? Peter Doig is ""a jewel of genuine imagination, sincere work, and humble creativity"".[6] Not only an immensely talented artist, he is also a profound thinker and a scholar, ready to transfer his knowledge to his students at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. His paintings take the mind to new places, far-off places, forgotten places. Even though he paints landscapes, it would make no sense to call him a landscape artist. Rather, he creates spooky fictional places inhabited by bizarre outcasts.  He is represented by Weng Contemporary, Kunzt Gallery and Galerie Fluegel-Roncak.  References:  ",172
Antoni Tapies,"Antoni Tàpies was a Spanish painter, sculptor and art theorist, who became one of the most famous European artists of his generation. He was born in Barcelona in 1923 into a cultured, middle-class, Catalan nationalist family who, since the 19th century, had been part of a publishing and book-selling tradition that awoke in him an early love of books and reading. That inclination was strengthened over a long convalescence from a lung disease, during which he began his first experiments with art. He spent an increasing amount of time on drawing and painting and ended up abandoning his law studies to devote himself to them fully. By the forties he was already exhibiting his works, which were outstanding on the art scene of the time. Tàpies shared a general sensibility which affected artists on both sides of the Atlantic after the Second World War and the dropping of the atomic bomb, and soon expressed an interest in matter - earth, dust, atoms and particles - which took the shape of the use of materials foreign to academic artistic expression and experiments with new techniques. The matter paintings make up a substantial part of his work and are a project he is still engaged in today. He believes that the notion of matter must also be understood from the point of view of Mediaeval mysticism as magic, mimesis and alchemy. That is how we must see his wish for his works to have the power to transform our inner selves. In the fifties and sixties Tàpies created a series of images, usually taken from his immediate environment, which would appear in the different stages of his evolution. Often, as well as being represented in different ways, a single image will have a series of differentiated meanings superimposed on one another. His message focuses on the revaluation of what is regarded as low, repulsive material (it is not by chance that he often chooses subjects traditionally held to be disagreeable or fetishist, such as a defecating anus, a discarded shoe, an armpit or a foot). Moreover, Tàpies’ work has always absorbed the political and social events of the time. In the late sixties and early seventies his political commitment in opposition to the dictatorship deepened and the works from that period have a marked character of denunciation and protest. Coinciding with the flowering of arte povera in Europe and post-minimalism in the United States, he worked more with objects, not showing them as they are but stamping them with his own seal and incorporating them into his language. In the early eighties, once democracy had returned to Spain, his interest in canvas as a support took on renewed strength. At that time he produced works with foam rubber or the spray technique, he used varnishes and created objects and sculptures in refractory clay or bronze, while remaining active in the field of graphic art. In the later years of the decade he seems to have a heightened interest in Eastern culture, a concern which had been incubating since the post-war years and which increasingly became a fundamental philosophical influence on his work because of its emphasis on what is material, the identity between man and nature and a rejection of the dualism of our society. He was also drawn by a new generation of scientists, who helped to provide a vision of the universe which understands matter as a whole in constant change and formation. The works of the last years are, most of all, a reflection on pain - both physical and spiritual - understood as an integral part of life. Influenced by Buddhist thought, Tàpies believes that a better knowledge of pain allows us to soften its effects and therefore improve our quality of life. The passage of time, which has always been a constant in his work, now takes on fresh nuances when lived as a personal experience which brings greater self-knowledge and a clearer understanding of the world around him. In recent years he has consolidated an artistic language which visually conveys both his conception of art and certain philosophical concerns which have been renewed over the years. His artistic practice is still open to the brutality of the present while offering a form which, despite its ductility, remains faithful to its origins. And so the works of the last few years are not only fully contemporary, they are also a record of his own past. Alongside his production of pictures and objects, since 1947 Tàpies has been active in the field of graphic work. He has produced a large number of collector’s books and dossiers in close association with poets and writers such as Alberti, Bonnefoy, Du Bouchet, Brodsky, Brossa, Daive, Dupin, Foix, Frémon, Gimferrer, Guillén, Jabès, Mestres Quadreny, Mitscherlich, Paz, Saramago, Takiguchi, Ullán, Valente and Zambrano. Moreover, he has written essays which have been collected in a series of publications, some translated into different languages: La pràctica de l’art (1970), L’art contra l’estètica, (1974), Memòria personal (1978), La realitat com a art (1982), Per un art modern i progressista (1985),Valor de l’art (1993) and L’art i els seus llocs (1999). He died in Barcelona, in 2012.",173
Dana Gordon,"American artist Dana Gordon is a renowned abstract painter known for exploring vibrant colors and playful shapes. Kaleidoscope-like compositions possess a strong visual conversation between lines, colors, and shapes. Besides painting, this multidisciplinary artist has also, in his long career, created Avant-garde films, written essays about art, and designed sets for dance performances and operas. Today Gordon’s artworks is part of numerous private and public collections, including CGNA Museum, Philadelphia; The Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY; Royal Film Archive of Belgium, Brussels; Adelphi University, Garden City, NY.   Dana Gordon, who was born in Boston in 1946, grew up in Chicago. After graduating from Brown University, Providence, with a bachelor's degree in writing and painting, he went to Hunter College in New York City, where he received a MA in painting. The artist went to work as an assistant to artists George Sugarman, a renowned sculptor, and Tony Smith. Sugarman's unique use of color was a big influence on Gordon’s artistic expression. Furthermore, the artist enrolled at the Institute of Design in Chicago, where he studied movies and photography with artist Aaron Siskind. Early on, Gordon began creating experimental films which were well received by critics and were on view at MoMA and various institutions internationally. His writing on art was published in Commentary, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Sun, and the Jerusalem Post.   Early on, Gordon was creating three-dimensional canvases however, after ten years, he began anew, reinventing his artistic expression by going back to the basics: lines and colors. By 2011, the artist concentrated more on the expression of colors and used lines only to create distinct edges of shapes. Much of his paintings were influenced by artist Camille Pissarro about whom he wrote several essays. Another major influence that helped the artist fully understand the creativity was music by such masters as John Coltrane and Miles Davis. Throughout his career, the artist has experimented and pushed the possibility of lines into liquid calligraphy. Gordon said: The artist’s artworks has been included in many solo and group exhibitions around the world, including Janet Kurnatowski Gallery, NYC; Gallery Camino Real, Boca Raton; Andre Zarre Gallery, New York; as well as the major retrospective of his artworks at the Westbeth Gallery, New York in 2019 titled Dana Gordon: Painting 1968-2018.   Dana Gordon has made several Avant-garde films, such as You Can't Alter Facts by Filming Them Over with Dead Romances, made in 1974. This experimental film about film premiered at a festival EXPRMNTL5, Belgium, and was exhibited in numerous venues, including Berlin Arsenal Kino and San Francisco Cinematheque. Artist also made films titled Elemental, Boston_Transference, and Perugia Ambulamatograph, which was shown at the Walker Art Center, Royal Belgian Film Archive/Cinematek, and Anthology Film Archive. Dana Gordon lives and works in New York City.  ",174
Olivier Valsecchi,"Olivier Valsecchi is a French photographer, born in 1979. He studied photography at ETPA Photography School in Toulouse, France. As a teenager, he used to produce music. His interest in photography began when he started taking photos in order to illustrate his record sleeves. Before his decision to enroll at ETPA Photography school and hone his technique, Valsecchi did only self-portraits for ten years. His working process is based entirely on his personal intuition, from planning to capturing the image. His works center around the themes of death, birth, rebirth and maternity.   Klecksography is the photographer's series which presents organic sculptures consisting of symmetrical bodies. The artist found the inspiration for his works in the tests by Swiss psychiatrist Rorschach. The doctor's tests used imagery created by ink stains on a piece of paper, which was folded into two, and the patients were asked for their interpretations of ambiguous ink blots. Rorschach used it to diagnose schizophrenia and dementia, but Valsecchi uses it to create complex artistic symmetries of naked bodies, intertwined in each other.   With the project entitled I Am Dust, Valsecchi focuses on the essence of creation and the urge to live. It consists of two series (so far) Dust and Time of War. Both series show human figures frozen in dynamic moves, with ashes covering their bodies and erupting around them. The only thematic difference is that Dust centers around Ovid's definition of Chaos and the concept of the Big Bang theory, whereas Time of War deals with the notion of time. The photographer tried to present the rebirth by using a smoke machine but eventually gave up on the idea, as he discovered that real ashes from a chimney were the best choice, despite three-hour cleaning in the end of each shooting. The process of his artistic creation would begin with Valsecchi explaining the models that ashes symbolize death and that they want to get rid of it. Then, he would start showering the undressed model with ashes, trying to capture the ashes in the air, before they fall to the ground.  The series titled Dust capture in the same image two opposites. Endings and beginnings, death and life, water and dust, so that the viewer is left confused and wondering where is the end and where is the start. The series depict the phoenix rising from the ashes. It is about creation and incarnation. Frozen bodies with closed eyes symbolize pure energy, and ashes are symbols of death, something that is about to return to the earth.   The recurring theme in Valsecchi's works is incarnation. The second part of his I Am Dust project is set in a former arms factory and named after the exhibition GOYA in Times of War, which was hosted by the Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain in 2008, to commemorate the War of Independence. The photographer's Time of War series is centered around survival and Valsecchi's fascination with Time.  Just like the Dust series, Time of War depicts frozen bodies of naked dancers, covered in ashes which are erupting all around them, as if thrown by an invisible threat. The tense bodies and contracted muscles covered in primeval ash portray survival and the urge to live. Beautiful shapes and movements of nude bodies guide us through the cycles of life and death. Time is circular, but human beings always seem to be fighting against it and the series is about a struggle to survive and go forward. Ash symbolizes death and models are pushing against it, trying to get rid of it, twisting and turning against this mysterious darkness of mortality.   The series entitled Drifting present a journey through art history, where nudes fuse with still life paintings. The Drifting series is somewhere between his two other projects – the dynamic I Am Dust and sculptural Klecksography. Drifting's eerie atmosphere, pale bodies, chiaroscuro approach of light, muted color schemes, the aura of surreal and figures which seem like they are dripping off the table, either falling apart or withstanding paralysis, relate to the notion of transitioning, the moment of disorientation when bodies are recovering from trauma or vertigo. It resembles both Bouguereau’s nudes and Dali's surreal paintings.   The photographer won the prestigious Hasselblad Masters Award in 2012 in Fine Art category for his Dust series. He was the Grand Jury Member of Hasselblad Masters Award in 2013. It is an annual award, organized by the company Hasselblad, a Swedish manufacturer of medium-format cameras and photographic equipment, and given to selected photographers each year. Olivier Valsecchi has exhibited his work in solo and group exhibitions around the world. In addition to that, he has participated in several art fairs, such as Lille Art Fair in France, Affordable Art Fair in England, Context Art Miami in the United States, and Raw Art Fair in the Netherlands. His first solo exhibition took place in Graz, Austria, at Galerie Fokus in 2010. The other venues where he exhibited include Galerie du Quartz in Brest, France; Galerie Le Carré d'Art  in Rennes, France; Opiom Gallery in France and Galerie Maubert in Paris.  Valsecchi's work has gained interest of the international press, and it has been featured in numerous printed and web publications, such as Le Monde from France, Orlando Weekly from the United States, Réponses Photo from France, Profifoto from Germany, Eyemazing from the Netherlands, Le Figaro Beaux-Arts from France, Zoom from Italy, Rooms from the United Kingsom, Arte Fotografico from Spain, Image in Progress from Italy, Blink from Korea, Empty from Australia and many more. Valsecchi is represented by Opiom Gallery in Opio.  ",175
Perle Fine,"An American Abstract Expressionist painter, Perle Fine is best known for her combination of the fluid and brushy rendering of the materials and her use of biomorphic forms encased and intertwined with irregular geometric shapes. Being one of the first women to be admitted to the Artist's Club, she developed a distinct visual language to explore the depths of human emotion and vitality. Fine's education began in her native Boston before she enrolled at the Art Students League in 1935 and fell under the influence of Piet Mondrian. In 1939, she began working with Hans Hofmann, both in New York and at his summer school in Provincetown, MA. Breaking with Hofmann's theories, she sought to find her own, more calm and contemplative mode of expression. Investigating the possibilities of nonobjective art, she was insistent on the dynamism of color and line, inspired by music, dance, and the natural world. While primarily a painter, she also experimented with collage, at various times using paper, foil, and even wood. A tireless innovator, she experimented with new styles on her own terms, always attempting to push color and line to their most expressive. ",176
Albert Llobet Portell,"Albert Llobet Portell is a contemporary artist whose abstract paintings explore the richness of colors, textures, lines, and compositions. Born in Figueres (the same city as Dalí), his strong connection with both Cataluña and Dalí was the inspiration behind his decision to study the arts and make art his vocation. He traveled south to Barcelona, where he studied at ELISAVA (School of design and engineering). His studies, the general artistic atmosphere in Barcelona, and meeting people from various fields of art and design have influenced Albert greatly, making him grow as an artist. This growth only continued when he participated in an exchange program at Rhode Island School of Design, United States, and graduated from the University of Southampton, London. He is now an experienced artist, known for his strong and powerful artwork.   ",177
Alain Laboile,"The emotional and stunning oeuvre of the French photographer Alain Laboile has captured the heart of the art world. The artist accidentally discovered his passion and eye for photography when he bought a camera to take shots of his sculptures. However, he soon discovered the tantalizing world of macro photography, which came from his interest in entomology. Laboile takes emotionally complex photographs of his family, particularly children playing. The artist has exhibited his work all over the world, including in Tokyo, Paris, Amsterdam, and Sao Paulo.   Born in 1968 in Bordeaux, France, Alain Laboile did not have any previous experience with the camera, and the need for a sculpture portfolio prompted him to acquire one in 2004. Even though he began taking macro photography, he quickly turned the camera toward his six children. Completely self-thought, the artist posted those first shots online and learned from people's critiques. Later, in 2012, he met the renowned American photographer Jock Sturges who became ""a kind of spiritual father who accompanies me in my artistic route."" Laboile does not have one artist that he admires or who inspires him. Instead, he makes an effort never to find one, for he sees his work as deeply personal. However, he can not avoid being compared to the likes of Sally Mann or that his work has a lot of similarities with street photography, a comparison he greatly appreciates. About his technique, Laboile said:   In his work, Laboile explores themes of nudity, freedom, having, and being. The emotionally vibrant photographs of children playing in and around the house perfectly capture their interaction with each other and the world. The artist possesses a unique natural talent that can recognize the psychologically defining moment, which can be best seen in the series La Famille. For a long time, Laboile used a Canon 5 D Mark III camera, but recently he switched to a Leica M monochrom with a 35mm f1,4 Leica lens. In 2016 he was included in the Top 100 LensCulture Street Photography Awards, and in 2019 he won the Alfred Fried Awards (Global Peace Awards) and the Hamdan International Photography Award.   In 2021 Laboile had a solo show entitled La Famille at Echo Fine Arts in Valbonne; in 2020, the exhibition In Situ at the Vieille Eglise in Mérignac, and Quotidian (2019) at Leica Gallery in Washington DC. The artist has also published several books, including Aurores (BeSpoke Collection) and Summer of the Fawn in 2018,  Under the Monochrome Rainbow (2015), and At the Edge of the World, published by Kehrer Verlag in 2015. Alain Laboile lives and works in Bordeaux, France. ",178

Manuela Karin Knaut,"Manuela Karin Knaut is a German contemporary artist best known for her paintings and installations. She builds her abstract compositions slowly, adding layers of colors and materials, then scraping them away, working them over and over. There is a subtle dance between gestural markings and bits of images taken from life, which are then rubbed away, transformed, abstracted and layered again. Knaut mixes traditional paints with everyday materials like glue, fabric, scraps of photos, and bits of discarded paper, lending her paintings to some physical and visual qualities as the modern environments that inspire her. The intuitive, layered approach that the artist brings to her paintings echoes her desire to break out of her comfort zone, both mentally and physically. Her search for a polyrhythmic visual language, in which a multitude of colors, textures, and materials intermingle, is informed by her extensive world travels. Though her central studio and print workshop are located in Braunschweig, Manuela Karin Knaut also keeps a studio in Johannesburg. Featured image: Manuela Karin Knaut - Dashing into the day 3, 2020 (detail). Acrylics, ink and oil on paper. 40 1/5 × 28 3/10 in. 102 × 72 × 0.1 cm. This is a unique work.

Tony Tasset,"Tony Tasset is an American multimedia artist best known for his large scale public sculptures that aim to articulate our reality in a satirical manner. Starting from the reconsideration of the ways our history was formed through display and narration, he developed a particular visual language profoundly influenced by the legacy of modernism, advertising, mass marketing, and popular culture. By using universal symbols and familiar techniques, Tasset constructs works that tackle universal human emotions. Besides sculpture, he also works with other media such as video, photography, film, and even taxidermy. The artist earned his BFA from The Art Academy of Cincinnati, and his MFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship and The Louis Comfort Tiffany Award. Alongside his artistic practice, Tasset holds the position of emeritus professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ",183
Scott Reeder,"American multidisciplinary artist Scott Reeder is known for creating paintings, installations, and sculptures of simple forms that explore and address complex ideas to deploy cultural critique. The artist works with non-conventional materials to create absurd, humorous and almost childish compositions in his paintings. The artworks made by pieces of pasta and paint have, over the years, received recognition for Reeder's subversive activity. The artist has had solo exhibitions at Retrospective in Hudson, Lisa Cooley in New York, Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art, Kavi Gupta in Chicago and Berlin and 356 Mission in Los Angeles. He also participated in numerous group exhibitions, including Saatchi Gallery, Detroit's Museum of Contemporary Art and the 2003 Venice Biennale.   Today Scott Reeder, born in 1970 in Battle Creek, Michigan, works at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago as a professor of drawing and painting. In the last decade, the artist has developed a practice and style so unique that it is impossible to summarise it. Reeder has succeeded in infusing art history's most traditional subjects, such as portrait and still life, with humour and lightheartedness. It is a clever technique that lowers viewers' guard and allows them to gaze upon his artworks with a sense of aesthetic freedom and optimism. One of the artist's most renowned works is a series titled Pasta Paintings. The saccharine work made with a mix of uncooked and cooked pasta and spaghetti looks like a background for a readymade of Abstract Expressionism.   In the series Cute Communists (2007), one can best see the cartoon-like style that the artist is best known for. The work consisting of bright colours and expressive lines features images of prominent communist leaders that possess a doll-like cuteness. In other works, such as Cops Ascending a Staircase (2009), Reeder painted anthropomorphic objects with humorous allusions to some of the greatest works in art history. His artwork has been reviewed in several art publications, including Artpapers, Art in America, ArtForum, the New York Times, and Flash Art. With his brother Tyson Reeder, Scott opened in 2002 the General Store, a gallery in Milwaukee. They also founded the Dark Fair at the Swiss Institute Contemporary Art New York in 2008, held in a dark room lit only by candlelight. In 1999 the brothers and filmmaker Chris Smith created an online platform ZeroTV.com.   After shooting for seven years, in 2014, Reeder premiered his first film titled Moon Dust. It has been shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Anthology Film Archives, NY, Chicago and Kunsthall Stavanger, Norway and The Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2020 at Canada in New York, the artist had a solo exhibition titled Didactic Sunsets. At the John Michael Kohler Art Center in Sheboygan, WI, Reeder had an exhibition B-Side of the Moon (2019). Scott Reeder lives and works in Chicago.  ",184
Lakshmi Mohanbabu,"Lakshmi Mohanbabu may not yet be a household name in the Singapore arts scene but, in all honesty, we like her chances of breaking into the elite of her country in near future. The way she is able to create art of varied type and form shows that this artist is extremely talented and not restricted to any one medium. When Mohanbabu was asked what her interests were in an interview with New Art United, the artist replayed a simple and effective statement: My interests revolve around art and design. I love books, travel, dance and music. Such a short reply best sums up Mohanbabu's art despite her being active in so many fields of art making: jewelry and fashion design, architecture, illustrating, painting in various techniques, etc.   Since she spent her childhood in Afghanistan during the late 70’s and 80’s, Lakshmi Mohanbabu witnessed all the destruction and chaos this unfortunate nation has been a victim too in recent history. All the horrors cultivated a keen desire to create art within Lakshmi Mohanbabu's mindset as the young artist saw such a practice as a perfect opposite to the devastation she saw all around herself. With such goals and concepts in mind, she joined up to study architecture at the Manipal Institute of Technology. After she completed the studies, Mohanbabu joined prominent architects Benjamin and Benjamin. At first, she desired to implement her counter-destruction ideas to designing structures. However, Lakshmi soon found out that making pieces of architecture was still too constrained by the realms of the society and that the community was simply not ready to shed its traditional molds. Since then, Mohanbabu added another goal that will serve as fuel to her future art-making - using her talent to spread messages for the betterment of the society. She furthered her studies by attending classes at the universities and workshops around Europe, acquiring an ability to incorporate cross-cultural elements in her artworks. Her paintings are a great example of how she is able to manipulate with everything she learned over the years, showing incredible skill in many different techniques - pen and ink, pencil color, charcoal, acrylic oil and watercolors.   Many of her paintings, especially those from the successful Interactions series, are composed with a single line that divides the painting into two distinct halves. By the painter's own acclaim, these represent the void and what is there, the Yin and Yang. This kind of pictorial solution can be attributed to Mohanbabu's history with architecture, as well as her appreciation of the pieces made by MC Escher and its ability to make a division of spaces and tessellations. It should also be noted that a lot of Lakshmi Mohanbabu's efforts go into conveying the messages on various social aspects through illustration which she does for numerous noteworthy organizations. Some of the most prominent names on this list are World Health Organization, Voluntary Health Association of India, World Wildlife Fund and National AIDS Control Organisation. All of her illustrations for such institutions are surprisingly simple yet tremendously effective and easy to interpret - something that can also be stated for the majority of her paintings. Besides all the aforementioned art practices, Lakshmi Mohanbabu also commits a lot of her time to fashion design - this artist was actually teaching fashion at NIFT in New Delhi, India. Over the years, she has now seen many of her students win International Awards. After arriving in Singapore, she continued teaching at Lasalle School of the Arts. Today, Lakshmi has design studios in both Singapore and India.    If she continues to create her amazing pieces, it's only a matter of time before Lakshmi Mohanbabu becomes the household name of her nation's scene. As of this moment in 2016, her plethora of work consists of over 300 paintings in various mediums, as well as an incredible number of design works from everything between furniture and large structures. Such impressive numbers only become more astonishing when combined with the fact that not only is Lakshmi's output becoming more diverse but that this artist is also getting better with every single artwork she creates.

Anthea Missy,"Anthea Missy is a French-born self-taught street artist currently living in Brussels who started exploring painting full time in 2014 after she obtained a masters’ degree in business administration. Since then, she has been combining her two greatest passions, traveling and creating, allowing the two to blend and recharge each other. Missy's art is underlined by her personal motto of Come as you are, a simple spiritual approach to life that heavily reflects itself on both her personal style and the way she treats her work upon its completion. Keeping that in mind, Anthea sets to create street art atmospheres rather than send explicit and direct messages, aiming to portray the character of a certain location.  Ever since Anthea Missy was a child, she was interested in drawing and collage, so these practices quickly became her hobby. When she got a little bit older, she studied business and administration instead but still had painting classes in her private time. Missy's father was an artist himself, so he was a constant source of inspiration and encouragement to his daughter. During her student days, her communication teacher bought his young pupil some paintings and encouraged her to embrace a career driven by self-expression. Soon, Anthea Missy graduated and started working in marketing and business consulting. Although this job sat relatively well with her, Missy needed to discover the world and travel, hoping that such experiences would help place herself outside the box creatively. Soon, her travels were followed by her art expressions and Anthea has been developing her unique brand of work ever since . Nowadays, her pieces have evolved into a celebration of bold strokes that form round shapes and create asymmetric and dynamic lace patterns, often emphasizing contrasts. Her work is fluid and smooth, proudly embracing elongated lines and patterns. Anthea also searches for clarity and density with spray paint, liquid acrylics and paint markers.  Anthea Missy finds inspiration in many different things, such as clothing and random people in the streets, but what constantly influences her art are the pure concepts of love and freedom. The latter also plays a big part in her creative process - Missy enjoys spontaneous painting, inspired by the ideas of automatic writing that were initially developed by Andre Breton in the early phases of the avant-garde art. Of course, every piece she makes is planned out before hand - Anthea just allows the moment to spontaneously change some aspects of the original plan. Inspired by the Japanese rules of art and many minimalistic concepts, the art of Anthea is all about motion and it exploits the tension of diagonals and circular patterns. As it was said earlier, her visual language owns a strong metaphysical dimension as well, one that allows the evolution towards a more tactile set of sensations.    Influenced by the community engagement and numerous personal artistic endeavors, Anthea Missy spreads her art where she feels it can make a positive difference. This is evidenced by the following statement made by the artist herself: If I am able to engage the community in my endeavors, the picture becomes more than a visual, it becomes a human story. If I can inspire others to do the same, take part, support, and connect together I have met my human objective as an artist. Additionally, one should not overlook the feminine contributions Missy provides to the urban art scene. Painting with heels and shorts, scrapping dirty walls, splashing paint over herself in her adventurous urban takes, Anthea Missy seems to convey a strong feministic message about women's role in street art.

Richard Caldicott,"Richard Caldicott is a British artist who explores mainly photography by creating abstract compositions.  Caldicott was born in 1962 in Leicester, England. In 1987 he earned a master degree from the Royal College of Art. Later on, Richard Caldicott perfected his art education at Middlesex Polytechnic, BA and Loughborough College of Art & Design. Caldicott’s abstract compositions of colors and geometric forms are widely known as a completely new and fresh use of mundane consumer products such as Tupperware, for example. Even though his exquisite photographic images could be considered ironic, Caldicott dictates to beholders’ eye one pretty much refined aesthetics. His photographs have been compared to the Color Field paintings of the Abstract Expressionists Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. Richard Caldicott is an interdisciplinary artist that experiments with different materials and techniques, including drawing, photography and sculpture. This artist’s work on paper is made with ballpoint pen or inkjet printing, and bears an austere elegance through minimal drawings (with one or two lines) or buoyant and colorful forms and floating shapes; but all of them are inextricably linked through their minimal aesthetic and focus. Repetition is one of many often used elements in Caldicott’s work - it echoes the art making of the Minimalism period. Caldicott use of camera to record collages and constructions has created a unique aesthetic niche that manages to reference iconic modernism without reverting to familiar forms. In 1986 he was awarded the Paris Studio Award of the Cité Internationale des Arts, RCA. Sir Elton John, very passionate art collector who owns one of the largest photography collections in the world, said about Caldicott: ""Richard has the unique ability to transform the medium of photography, creating something new, but still using the most traditional technique. Richard is one of those artists who elevate photography to an important and recognized form of contemporary expression.""  At the end of the 1990s, Caldicott created a series of Tupperware containers as large scale semi-abstract still lives - cheeky and humorous as they were obviously creative transformations of something that was very cheap. Piling vibrantly colored plastic cups and bowls, he created abstract formations that were like eye-popping op-art paintings. After that, he explored collage, taking source material derived from various modernist tropes and situations, until a strange new geometry emerged from the mix.  In 2008, his exhibition titled Untitled 2008, opened London's Hamiltons gallery. With this series, once again Caldicott placed unusual objects at the centre of the frame. His concern is very often simply the metamorphosis of the everyday, which for him has something almost alchemical about it. Regarding this metamorphosis and photography, he went even further by chemically transforming his constructions into two-dimensional pictures at the touch of a button - aiming for a kind of transmutation of the functionality of everyday objects as done in his Constructions series. The curiosity of this collection was that the artist himself has been making the object photographed – Cadicott created collages and assemblages, and then photographed them multiple times.  Richard Caldicott's work has a relationship with architectural and musical structures, formalism and geometry. In 2014, he collaborated with Darius Ciuta, a Lithuanian artist from a quiet music field that deals with micro sound, where focus is on the tiny, elusive note. Ciuta recorded snowflakes falling on paper and sent it to Caldicott who used that paper to produce a graphic image. After that, Darius used Richard's work as the graphic notation to compose a digital album titled S-P, from a recording of snowflakes falling. The album was published by Very Quiet Records, a small independent label with a simple idea: they release recordings of quiet places or situations from sound artists and field recordists from around the world.  In 2015, Caldicott presented his new works at the collective exhibition which explores contemporary abstract art-making practices. The show is held at 886 Geary Gallery in San Francisco. Titled Shapeshifters & Sharpshooters, this exhibition features 15 international artists and is guest-curated by Sven Davis, independent curator and art critic from the UK. Shapeshifters & Sharpshooters is a sort of celebration of contemporary mark making, while embracing traditional art movements such as Futurism, Abstract Expressionism and Precisionism amongst others. A common thing for the whole group is their use of Hard-Edge painting; where abrupt transitions are found between color areas. This kind of painting style is related to Geometric abstraction, Op Art, Post-painterly Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Richard Caldicott’s work has been acquired in several significant public and private collections, including the Peter C. Ruppert Collection; Museum im Kulturspeicher, Germany; Goss-Michael Foundation, Dallas, TX; Goldman Sachs International, London; Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany; Sir Elton John Collection, Los Angeles / London; Gert Elfering Collection, Miami; Karl Blossfeldt / Albert Renger-Patzch Collection / Ann and Jürgen Wilde, Köln; and Fidelity Worldwide Investment, London, among others. His work has been exhibited extensively in solo and group shows, as well as several art fairs, including Art Basel, Photo Miami, Paris Photo, FIAC, The AIPAD Photography Show, and the Venice Biennale. Since March 2015, he has been represented by IdeelArt. Richard Caldicott lives and works in London, UK. Interview with Richard Caldicott on Saturationpoint",187
Paola Pivi,"An Italian contemporary artist, Paola Pivi is best known for her series of whimsical, feather-covered bears. Working in a wide range of media, such as photography, sculpture, site-specific installations and performance, Paola creates extraordinary, surreal and bizarre settings that resonate with the audience. Born 1971 in Milan, Italy, Pivi currently lives and works in Anchorage, Alaska. Between 2013 and 2016 was based in Delhi, India – together with her husband, the composer Karma Lama / Culture Brothers – because of the adoption of their adoptive son. In 1999, she received the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Biennale. Pivi is best known for her series of whimsical, feather-covered bears, seeking to reveal the power of imagination and freedom. Her works often feature animals in bizarre or surreal contexts, making references to the human condition. She explained these works were inspired by Duchamp's readymade and that her thinking comes from the abstract process we all have, the subconscious. Preferring not to read too much into her art, but to simply create amazing works that resonate with the audience, she once explained: ""It is the art that is the interesting thing, and to elaborate on it just doesn’t serve any purpose for me.""

Joanne Freeman,"Joanne Freeman liked art since an early age, had painted and took courses at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, but when time for college came, she chose to major in writing and sociology. Definitive transition came around her Junior year in college, when she had her first ‘wow’ moments inspired by art. Influences like architecture, design and symbols which she found in New York led to very reductive formality of her artworks, rooted in modern aesthetics and ideology. This reductive formality is the core, as the artworks are austere in their means, but yet manage to successfully communicate with the viewers. Boundaries and limitations of choice that Freeman decided to apply to her paintings give her the opportunity to emphasize the represented quality.   She received her BS in Fine Arts from University of Wisconsin in 1976 and her MA in Studio Art from New York University in 1981. Generations of student had the privilege of learning from her while she taught Painting and Drawing at The New School for Social Research, and during her time as a visiting lecturer at The New York Studio School and the Massachusetts College of Art.  Freeman thinks that formal education in art is important as it provides an entry point to a world of art, galleries, and other artists’ work. It also gives students a specific vocabulary, which allows them to better express themselves. Creating artworks is a solitary act, and that presence in the artistic courses gives young people the first taste of belonging in the artistic community.   Recent line of work is largely influenced by the artist’s trip to Otranto in Italy. The shadows and light on the white facades of the buildings were mesmerizing. Adriatic light which makes darkness of shadows turn into color can be seen in the work. The artwork titled Otranto is a beautiful example of creativity Freeman possesses. Depth of the ultramarine gave it almost a transparent look. Then cobalt and turquoise emerged. Calligraphic shapes painted with a flat brush were put together and they eventually formed a beautiful piece.   There is no sketching, the artist just jumps right in. Painting is a very physical process which involves making a lot of mistakes. Sketch can’t be transposed into painting, at least that’s how the artist feels. Working is a spontaneous act for Freeman, and any kind of preparation takes away that feeling. She wants the lines, colors and forms to coalesce, and for her painting to be read as a whole. Circular lines in her pieces are made from the sweep of her arm, and there the physicality of her work really stands out, as the proportions of these lines are dependent on the proportions of the artist.   Freeman works in series and on several pieces at once. So, every painting is inspired by the once previously painted, but also by the ones which are in the process of creation. Of course she sometimes hits a blockade, and admits she is able to paint bad paintings in series. The artist knows that taking a break may be a good solution, but she just keeps working until she finds the right path. Gouache on Khadi, a handmade Indian paper and oil on canvas are the mediums Freeman works in. Shapes and the hard edges that make her artworks recognizable come from the idea that the painting is read as the 2-dimensional surface but also the 3-diminsional object. The circular ones are the good example of that.   A perfectionist in a way, Freeman considers a painting finished when it’ not bothering her anymore, when everything is in its place and the message is clear. As someone whose identity was formed through art-making, Joanne Freeman knows how important is to do something you enjoy in life. Like listening to music when you’re a kid, it just forms your early identity, and everything else is building on top of that. It gave the artist inspiration and energy (especially rock n’ roll). The painting also had a huge part of her identity, and still is. Her paintings are her memories, her experience and her spirit. They speak for her in a way words never could. She is represented by IdeelArt gallery in London, UK.  Featured image courtesy of IdeelArt. Images copyright © Joanne Freeman and IdeelArt.",189
Debra Ramsay,"Harmony and balance, as well as rhythm and order in nature, have been a source of inspiration for artists over centuries. Debra Ramsay, an American contemporary painter, found it in the earth realm when she witnessed the changing seasons. Rather than creating pieces that would allude to underlying meanings, emotions, or narratives, she focuses on some of the basic elements of an artwork - line, form, tone, pattern and color making the nature-inspired pieces of art that recall color field paintings, especially the stripe works made by Gene Davis in the 1960s.   In the spring of 2013, Ramsay began an ambitious project entitled Landscape as Time. The project had roots in photographs shot during nature walks the artist took while on a residency in the town of New Berlin in upstate New York. Away from chaos and crowds and toward a place where she could witness the wisdom and grace of nature the artist documented the shifting colors of landscapes, fruit, leaves, and trees through the seasons of a calendar year. She photographed the chosen landscape eighteen times at intervals of one hundred paces on at least four occasions throughout the year. Back in the studio, she translated the collected colors from the photographs into the pigments she wanted via a computer application. The resulting output presents an abstraction of nature’s cycles, informed by mathematics and explored through geometry and color. Her vertical clusters and horizontal stacks show how the landscape changes from spring through winter.   Educated at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn College, and Oregon State University, Debra Ramsay has created thoughtful, meditative and abstract body of work engaged with rule-based systems and mathematics. She was awarded a fellowship at BAU Institute in Otranto, Italy in 2012, a residency at the Golden Foundation in New Berlin, NY in 2013 and a residency at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation in 2016. Her work has been included in numerous collective shows in such galleries as Pentimenti Gallery, Philadelphia, and Pocket Utopia Gallery, New York. Her debut solo show Desire Lines was held at Blank Space Art in New York in 2012. In September 2016, Ramsay will open solo exhibition at ODETTA gallery in Brooklyn.  The parallels between geometry and art can be seen in many of Ramsay’s pieces. Using mathematics as a tool in her practice, she often creates serially related works such as paintings from Measuring Parallels series. She applies geometry and rule-based systems to the abstract interpretation of color, space, and time. The shape and the placement of color in her pieces evoke meditative and transcendent feelings of sublimity but also leave the viewers to create their own stories. The artist is represented by IdeelArt since March 2016.  ",190
Bernhard Lang,"Since the year of 2010, German photographer Bernhard Lang has been developing an amazing and unique style in the field of aerial photography. His incredible shots from above have a strong illusion of abstraction that Lang tends to indicate and all of them strive to conciliate a pleasing aesthetic while also emphasising an environmental awareness. As his subjects, Lang chooses to shoot things we see every day, the things that surround us and are often taken for granted - but this artist manages to pull his photos of in a way that makes us feel unfamiliar with everything that appears inside his frame. Shortly put, Lang's fascinating aerial photos are some of the most impressive shots we've seen in a long time.   Bernhard Lang hails from Munich, Germany, and has been a successful commercial photographer for over twenty years prior to the radical change of style. As was said before, the sudden commitment to aerial photography came during the year of 2010. He started creating these kinds of photos after he got inspired during a flight over Siberia, in a plane that was bound for Tokyo. Looking through a small window by his seat, Lang became fascinated with the nature of the white landscape below. Soon after that, he wanted to return to the skies and try to capture such sights with his trusty camera. As a result of that decision came a number of extensive projects that featured aerial views of various elements associated with tourism, industry and different means of transport. His award-winning images are taken at a 90-degree angle to the earth’s surface. In order to take that kind of imagery, Lang leans out into the open air from a helicopter or a light aircraft to press the shutter on his camera – at heights of up to 1,000 meters! Such bravery and determination are impressive on their own, but the results by far outweigh the daredevil nature of the making process - Bernhard's work is so fascinating that it's simply too hard to put it into words. This brave approach makes the entire outlook on photography different, turning it into some sort of an adventure without compromising the artistic side of the medium's identity. It's incredible how even his shots of docks and industry somehow manage to capture the hidden beauty of such places, although you would not expect to find such grace in those circumstances.    It's not easy to grasp the full extent of Lang's photos at the first moment you view them - it takes some time for your eyes to deal with all the details and figure out what they are watching. So many details can be found in his frames that it often feels overwhelming. It is this tension between the two-dimensional, almost painterly abstraction and the attention to detail that produces the unique aesthetic appeal of Lang’s photographs. Another aspect that proved to be troublesome to viewers comes if the audience dares to try and guess at which distance the camera is from the ground - you can't actually tell if the photographer is 300 feet above or perhaps 3,000 feet. Lang says he's obsessed with finding what he calls the ideal distance - the point where humans and nature could live together in a perfect match. This leads us to a thing we clued at before - much of Bernhard Lang's work is connected with the impact of the industrialisation and human beings on the natural environment. That subtle note of criticism leaves the viewers with a feeling of how some changes must be brought in order to improve out societies. The relationship between man and the natural world is a recurring theme throughout Lang's projects, highlighting the extent to which mankind has appropriated his environment. All of the aerial projects Lang ever worked on had him really emphasizing the structural aesthetic inside the photos. It's interesting how Lang manages to achieve strong notes of abstraction by simply shooting images from a bird's perspective - what's even more impressive is the way Bernhard simultaneously succeeded to make many of his photos seem organized and ordered despite the illusion of abstraction. The photographer finds excellent angles and by doing so arranges the elements of his images in geometric patterns. That way Bernhard creates an illusion that his work is a sort of a puzzle that demands to be unriddled.    Some artists dare to risk more in order to create the best pieces of art they are capable of. This statement is a hand in glove fit with Bernhard Lang - for him, no risk is too great when it comes to his efforts to capture breathtaking shots he does. The most interesting part of his portfolio is that Lang literally shoots things we all have seen thousands of times beforehand - he only shows us how they look from a different perspective that would otherwise be unavailable to all of us. Grand in every sense of the word, Bernhard's large format photos are a perfect illustration of how mankind functions inside a chaos we call our world.

Ulla Pedersen,"Ulla Pedersen is a Danish abstract artist whose work is a minimal and concrete exploration of color, materiality, form and balance. Pedersen studied from 2003 through 2005 with Ingela and Thomas Skytte at the Spektrum Art School in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 2004 she received an honorary grant from the Aage and Yelva Nimbs Foundation.  Pedersen works with acrylic paint on many different surfaces, including canvas, wood, paper, cardboard and plastic. Her process is reductive. When painting a composition, she tends toward a limited color palette, often reducing the composition to minimal, hard-edged shapes on solid-colored fields. When making her assembled pieces, she cuts shapes away then re-combines them into new configurations, using both the positive elements (the shape she has cut out) and the negative elements (the part that was left behind). She uses everything, juxtaposing notions of “form and non-form,” and always leaving room for discovery and surprise.  Pedersen is inspired by the potential she sees in formal aesthetic elements. She is particularly fascinated with the circle. Her work can be seen as an investigation into the way relationships emerge and evolve when elements like color, form, shape, angle, and pattern are blended, shifted and layered. The harmonies and tensions in the work arise from different relationships: those between the colors, the patterns, and the geometric and organic shapes. She is also interested in art materials. As she experiments with different surfaces, mediums, and techniques, the artistic process itself becomes the basis of her discovery.    Pedersen has exhibited throughout Denmark primarily in curated Group exhibitions and solo exhibitions in companies in the capital area. Her work is included in the collections of the Danish Foreign Ministry Art Association, the Danish Ministry of Integration Art Association, the Copenhagen City Art Foundation, and the Municipal Art Collection of the City of Aarhus. The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",193
Rae Johnson,"Rae Johnson was a Canadian painter whose work dealt with dreams and imagination. Her work features enough detail to recognize figures and spaces but encourages the viewer to contemplate endings, meanings and loss. Born in 1953 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Johnson studied at the New School of Art in Toronto from 1975 to 1976 and at the Ontario College of Art from 1977 to 1980. In 1981, she co-founded the ChromaZone gallery, an artist collective dedicated to reintroducing figurative painting to Toronto. After moving to Flesherton in northern Ontario in 1987, she began producing landscapes reminiscent of the work of the Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven, whose work she had seen at the National Gallery of Canada when she was still a student. From 2009-2011, she acted as guest curator for the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art, and National Gallery @ MOCCA. In 2012, she curated and organized an exhibition of 32 artists from Canada titled TORONTO/BERLIN 1982-2012, hosted by the Zweigstelle Berlin Gallery in Berlin. Throughout her career, she has painted the highs and lows of life in her metaphorical paintings. Tapping into the sacred and the profane, she painted everything from demons to winged creatures in the snow, angel-like figures, orgies, bathtub lovers, lowlifes, drunks, saint-like figures and lush Garden of Eden-like greenery.

Mary Dill Henry,"Mary Dill Henry, also known as Mary Henry, was an American artist whose bold geometric abstractions are known for their formal gymnastics, breathtaking scale and audacious color. Born in 1913, Sonoma, California, United States, she studied at the California College of the Arts (then called the California School of Arts and Crafts) in Oakland, California. After winning a prize in a printmaking contest sponsored by Iowa State University (Ames, Iowa), she was invited there to teach applied art in their home economics department. After attending a lecture by Bauhaus artist László Moholy-Nagy, she continued her studies with him at the Institute of Design in Chicago, studying drawing, architectural drawing, photography, texture, and sculpture. After her divorce, she began her career as a mature artist. Henry's work is in the collections of the Seattle Art Museum, Tacoma Art Museum, Portland Art Museum, Institute of Design IIT, Microsoft, Safeco, Hewlett-Packard, and Amgen, among others. A modernist of great vision and integrity, Henry created art that resembles, variously, Op art, Constructivism, or even Psychedelic art. She often worked in diptychs and triptychs. Exploring depth, her works are characterized by crisp, clean lines and an unemotional use of color, highlighting an extraordinary intellectual clarity. ",196

Albert Stadler,"An American painter, Albert Stadler was a leading figure in the rise of color abstraction in the mid-1960s. Addressing the nature of optical experience, he saw his canvases as an invitation for the viewer to participate in events, in the activity of color and the relativity of space. Born in New York, Stadler attended the University of Pennsylvania and received his BFA from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 1950. After his first solo exhibition held in 1962 at Bennington College, Vermont, the Bennington Banner reported that it provided “visual pleasure [and] sensuous stimulation . . . if one can let the eye enjoy what it sees.” In his work, Stadler created what he described as ""deliberate variations"", aimed at illuminating and elucidating all parts of painting. Uniting directions in Color Field and Minimalist art, he often bridged the gap between the intellectual and sensual and the conceptual and spiritual. In 1967, Kermit Champa, then assistant professor of art history at Yale University, praised the artist for his uncanny ability to maintain individual components of color while creating a final effect that was one of absolute visual unity, constituted a breakthrough. ",199
Edward Avedisian,"An American abstract painter, Edward Avedisian combined the hot colors of Pop Art with the cool, more analytical qualities of Color Field painting. His work was initially associated with Color field painting and in the late 1960s with Lyrical Abstraction. Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, Avedisian studied art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. By the late 1950s he moved to New York City, where he joined the dynamic art scene in Greenwich Village, frequenting the Cedar Tavern on Tenth Street, associating with the critic Clement Greenberg, and joining a new generation of abstract artists who were exploring the limits and possibilities of art by experimenting with new techniques and ways of organizing pictorial space. Avedisian was instrumental in the exploration of new abstract methods to explore the primacy of optical experience. In the 1960s, he produced large canvases characterized by a verticalized emphasis in paintings consisting of overlapping, irregular swaths of rich color. In the mid-1970s, Avedisian abruptly left New York City and moved upstate to Hudson, New York, where he began painting representational scenes from his immediate environment, such as men at work, billboards, and couples in repose.

Ray Mead,"Ray Mead was a Canadian abstract expressionist painter and a founding member of the artists group Painters Eleven. In both his drawings and paintings, his imagery was sourced his own internal meanderings, memories transcribed into line and blocks of color. He often used a high horizon line as a structural element. Born in Watford, United Kingdom, Mead studied under John Nash and Randolph Schwab at the Slade School of Art in London, graduating in 1939. During the World War II, in 1943, he moved to New York where he first encountered American abstraction in the work of Stuart Davis. In 1946, he moved to Hamilton, Ontario where he co-founded Painters Eleven with Hortense Gordon. At their start in the 1950s, these artists abandoned all literal representation for a purely abstract expression. His work is included in numerous collections including the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario. Mead himself described his drawings as striving toward simple childhood marks, but these were executed with a great deal of sophistication. Resulting from fluid investigations, his works employ similar marks transformed by incredible color sensitivity. Although minimal in composition, works are not pure Minimalism as the artist always sought to preserve to evidence of his human hand in the completed paintings. ",201
Jean-Philippe Delhomme,"A Paris based fashion illustrator, painter and cultural writer, Jean-Philippe Delhomme is best known for painting scenes devoid of any human presence, based on direct observation of the urban landscapes of the big city, whether New York, Paris, or Los Angeles.

Arman,"I specialize very much in… everything. I have never been — how do you say it? A dilettante. This is the quote from the 1960s, an era that has left us with many small — and not so small —  revolutions: Jean-Luc Godard and the New Wave, The Beatles, Andy Warhol, and, of course, the Nouveau réalisme movement, co-founded and led by Arman, a French artist known for his bold and visionary projects. His origins are not an easy thing to explain: he described himself as the Algerian-Spanish, with the ancestors from Malta, Tunisia, and Algeria. His grandfather was Sephardi and his grandmother was Spanish. For a man with so many origins, he managed just fine to transmit the universal message to the entire humankind.  During the late 80s, a new art style emerged with a goal to give a new life to the discarded products of mass consumption. This, pretty much visionary style, was named Scatter Art. It was a direct successor of the infusions from the early '70s Process Art. Arman was one of scatter art’s early proponent. Disgusted by what the world had become – this artist developed his recognizable style, a strategy of accumulating different images and objects, creating the assemblages or collages, without any glue. Armand Pierre Fernandez was born in Nice, France in 1928. His father was an amateur artist, photographer, cellist, and an antique dealer. No wonder young Armand was initialized as a boy into the world of art, learning oil painting and photography when the most of his coevals were still passionately interested only in playing. Armand began hyper-producing his early drawings and paintings signing them only with his first name, just like one of the artists who had a great influence on him - Vincent van Gogh - used to do. Arman would stay consistent to this practice for the rest of his career, with one anecdote surrounding a missing ""D"" in his name. Due to the printer’s mistake on a catalog cover in 1958, when his name Armand was misspelled as Arman, this artist decided to keep his new name signing all of his work with Arman, until the rest of his life.   The artist received a Philosophy and Mathematics bachelor's degree in 1946. Additionally, he decided to make a serious attempt at life as an artist, and enrolled the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs in Nice, just to move on to the field of history at the École du Louvre, completing his studies in the archaeology and oriental art in 1949. During all that time, Arman was fascinated by the work of Jackson Pollock and Nicolas de Staël, and he was passionately dedicated to judo, as well! While training at the police school back in his native Nice, he befriended with French artist Yves Klein and French composer Claude Pascal. Three friends frequently took road trips, the adventures hitch-hiking tours all around Europe. After graduation, Arman worked as a teacher at the Bushido Kai Judo Club in Madrid and served in the French army as a medical orderly, participating actively in the Indo-China War, ended in 1954. For all that time, he never lost interest in art – Arman based his artistic expression in a certain insurgency against Abstract Expressionists and Tachistes and their gestural techniques. He was on the quest for different sources and different means in creating a new kind of art, grounded in the idea of itself. Arman began to work on paintings that only resembled gestural abstractions, while he was actually producing concrete artistic forms, using an already existing object, the products of the modern time and its society.   One of Arman’s first projects was so called Cachets, a neo-dadaist stamp prints done during the mid-50s. He later moved on to the Allures, an object impressions, and then to cut-up objects that he entitled Coupés. In the beginning of the '60s, Arman was still under a tremendous impression by the exhibition German Dadaist Kurt Schwitters held in 1954. He began accumulating old materials and discarded objects that slowly started their metamorphosis into a series named Cachets, 2D accumulations, which were actually his first serious artistic commitment. Arman’s career simply took off after his third solo exhibition held in Paris' Galerie Iris Clert where he presented the Cachets. His original concept of the accumulation of same objects’ vast quantities, simply launched the young artist to the very top of the artistic world at the time. Following Cachets, Arman also created his famous Poubelles or trash bins - a collection of strewn garbage objects in Plexiglas cases. For example, he once put 2000 wrist watches into one such box.   During the '60s, Arman co-founded the Nouveau réalisme movement, a French reaction to the Pop art movement. The fascination was mutual, Andy Warhol had in his collection two of Arman’s Poubelles, and Arman appeared in the Warhol’s 1964 film Dinner at Daley’s. Arman participated actively in the creation of Nouveau réalisme along with art critic Pierre Restany, his friends Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely, and Jacques Villeglé. The exact moment of the New Realism’s birth was at its first group exhibitions at the Apollinaire Gallery in Milan. A movement’s manifesto, titled Constitutive Declaration of New Realism, was written in April of 1960. Through the extensive use of collage, assemblage, and painting, the members were in a constant search for a new approach to the concept of reality.   Arman’s next stop was a destruction phase. He intended to channel his anger towards mass production and mass consumption, so he got to think of a way to create something completely new, but using old products. Coleres is a series that included a complete destruction of the subject. After slicing, burning, wading or smashing different objects (from violin to car), he would find a way to mount on canvas the leftovers. Seems as if the main impeller of his work was his contempt towards a mass production. By expressing such an irrational rage like he did in Colers, Arman was actually trying to revive human nous and point out on a disaster waiting to happen – everyday life threatened by a global domination of the materialism. Boy, was he right! His somehow chilling rejection of modernization, shown through the destruction and re-composition of objects or the endlessly repeating forms, was still surprisingly compatible with the work of the American Minimalists and Pop artists of the same period. Also, Duchamp's idea that contemporary sculpture had to confront the commodity was joyfully accepted by Arman, so he is considered a pioneer in the efforts to create a European comeback of Marcel’s readymade. Craft skills and imagination were no longer essential in creating a sculpture, but responding to the characteristics of mass-production and industrial expansion was.  One of Arman's accumulations that really brought on a lot of attention is definitely the largest of them all: Long Term Parking, on a French Château de Montcel in Jouy-en-Josas’ permanent display. It was finished and inaugurated in 1982, presenting to the public 60 cars embedded in over 18,000 kg of concrete, in an 18-meter high installation. Another of his ambitious pieces was created in 1995. The work was commissioned by the Lebanese government in order to celebrate 50 years of the Lebanese military's service. The piece was exposed in Beirut, a city that suffered great destruction during the war. The sculpture is 32-meter high and contains 83 tanks and other army vehicles!    Arman's almost obsessive use of trash and other discarded objects serve today more than ever as a constant reminder of the wreckage of human history, but the future as well. One might say that he tried to stop us from digging our graves, burying us in our own personal and unnecessary waste.  The artist, who died in New York City on October 22, 2005, exhibited his oeuvre in galleries and museums internationally. His work can be found in some of the world's most notable institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Tate Gallery in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and many other public and private collections.

Ray Parker,"Best known as an Abstract expressionist painter, Raymond Parker was also associated with Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction. Parker was an influential art teacher, an important Color Field painter, and an instrumental figure in the movement coined by Clement Greenberg called Post-Painterly Abstraction. Born in 1922 in Beresford, South Dakota, Parker attended the University of Iowa where he earned his MFA. From 1948 to 1951 he taught painting at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. His early works were influenced by Cubism, but after meeting the leading Abstract Expressionists of the day, including Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning, he began to simplify and refine his works through abstraction and color. Combining his appreciation for jazz, Henri Matisse, and Color Field painting, Parker produced unique works in an improvised painting style that reflected various emotional states. Over the years, he developed a singular style characterized by intense color and simple geometric shapes. Among his most famous bodies of work are the Simple Paintings from the late 1950s early 1960s, where he used the method of stacked, clearly colored floating forms that are straightforward and geometric in shape. Parker died in 1990. ",208
Luuk de Haan,"Dutch artist Luuk de Haan makes photographs derived from a unique method that combines contemporary technologies like digital graphics software with historic photographic techniques. Such a method results in pieces with strong shapes and an obvious visual note that pays homage to Minimalism. Luuk de Haan's work offers a glimpse into an unfamiliar and obscure area, a persuasive and clear parallel universe otherwise unavailable to us. Make no mistake - a quiet and personal world, deep and as sober as colorful, the creative universe of Luuk de Haan is truly one of a kind.  Luuk de Haan was born in Vlaardingen, South Holland, Netherlands. He studied at the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht (Hoge School voor de Kunsten HKU), in Utrecht, Netherlands, an institution which allowed the aspiring artist to develop both his skill and the overall understanding of art. Ever since his student days, Luuk's inspiration could be traced to a same source - he was and still is influenced mainly by minimalist aesthetics, something that is fairly obvious to anyone observing his mature work. He is also inspired by music and a sense of poetic openness. Luuk de Haan likes comparing this artistic mix of concrete and abstract influences to architecture - in other words, he likes to view his work as a kind that is defined as much by solid forms as by the space and silence within it.   As it was clued at earlier in this text, Luuk de Haan's visual art relies on the mediums of photography, drawing and digital tools in order to create organic, geometric abstract compositions. The creative process begins when Luuk uses digital software to generate a geometric composition of some sort. He then photographs that composition directly from the screen. By adjusting the conditions under which the photograph is taken, the artist allows the analog photographic process to interact with the digital image in ways that are often unpredictable, introducing an element of surprise to the final result. Sometimes De Haan will perform various gestures with his hands while exposing the photograph, giving an active quality to the image and adding another conceptual level to his work. The resulting images can simultaneously be read as naturally expressive as well as graphic and stern explorations of shape, color, geometry and line.   Luuk de Haan has exhibited extensively in a variety of galleries and museums throughout the Netherlands and Germany so far, as well as appearing at international fairs like Art New York, EXPO Chicago and Art Miami. And, to put it bluntly, we are not surprised by the amount of interest people display towards this man's work - Luuk de Haan uses an intriguing combination of contemporary tools and human processes that attracts attention due to both its uniqueness and visual experience. In other words, he provides something original and exciting, a combination that will never let you down in the art world. This artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",209
Elizabeth Gourlay,"Elizabeth Gourlay is an American contemporary artist who explores the possibilities of color, form and architectural space in her abstract paintings, works on paper, and prints. She uses a wide range of media including oil, acrylic, ink and graphite to produce her unique pieces.   Gourlay works through an intuitive process of layering color and forms to infuse the act of painting with her thoughts, emotions, and observations of the nature. The elements taken from music, architecture and the world around the artist, drive her compositions and colour combinations.  The colours in her artworks are sharply and fully chosen ranging from almost monochromatic to highly polychromatic. The artist permanently examines ways to broaden the scale of color interaction and expression. Repetitions of shape, color and line create pieces that are playful and serious, but also mysterious, meditative and stimulating.  Born in 1961, Elizabeth Gourlay earned her BA (First Class Honors) from Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1983 and her MFA in Painting from Yale University School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut in 1985. She is the recipient of several grants and fellowships, including two Individual Artist State Grants from the DECD/Connecticut Office of the Arts.  Her work has been included in numerous individual and collective shows at galleries and museums throughout the United States and beyond including Fox Gallery NYC, New York; ArtHelix, Brooklyn, New York; 500X Gallery, Dallas, Texas; The National Academy Museum & School, New York, New York; The Mattatuck Museum, Waterbury, Connecticut; DNA Gallery, Provincetown, Massachusetts; and The Hecksher Museum, Huntington, New York, among others. Her work is held in many collections including the Marriott Family; the LeWitt Collection; Agnes and William Peelle, West Hartford, CT; Alliance Capital Management; The Vermont Studio Center, Johnson, VT; and Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh, Scotland.

Holly Miller,"Holly Miller is an American artist, known for fusing optical and tactile in her abstract paintings. The artist was born in 1958 in Buffalo, New York, and raised in Rome, Italy. She attended the School of Visual Arts in New York, where she obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1984. Miller's paintings combine colored geometric shapes and threaded lines, inviting the viewer to look closer. The works reveal numerous dichotomies, such as absence and presence, warm and cool, masculine and feminine, illusion and material. In addition to paintings, the artist's body of work also includes drawings and installations.  Her life in Italy had an influence on her artistic career. She combines the sensibilities of both American and Italian cultures using painting, her personal way of communication. The tactility of her works is influenced by body language and communication through touch. She is also inspired by Italian industrial design of the 1960s and 1970s, Ellsworth Kelly's vivid colors and shapes, Lucio Fontana's psychical approach, and the way Alberto Burri manipulates the painting's surface. Her works are featured in the collections of Weatherspoon Art Museum in Greensboro, North Carolina; Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock, Arkansas; and University of Kentucky Art Museum in Lexington, Kentucky.  Holly Miller's works have been exhibited both in the United States and abroad, in Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom. She had solo exhibitions at the galleries such as Elizabeth Harris Gallery in New York City, Clementine Gallery in New York City, and Galleria STUDIO E in Rome, Italy. In 1999, the painter's artwork was featured in DICA 33, the book of poems by Antonella Villa.  She is represented by Elizabeth Harris Gallery in New York City, US and IdeelArt gallery in London, UK, since October 2015.  All images copyright © the artist",211
Tracey Adams,"Tracey Adams is a contemporary artist that's known for creating artworks at the intersection of ""art, math, and music.""1 Being a former musician herself, Tracey Adams often uses rhythm to explore relationships between people and objects. The influence of music is visible in the artist's highly rhythmical artworks that often include visual intervals, patterns, and similar references. Mathematics, on the other hand, is employed to pre-determine a number of colors that will be used when creating an artwork, the number of times they will appear and the way they will be aligned in the compositions.  Tracey Adams is an American artist born in 1954. She studied painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Ever since she was three years old the artist felt a strong urge to create. Regardless whether she makes collages, paintings or monotypes all of her artworks share a common thread that separates them from works of other artists. Tracy Adams grew up in the house full of Japanese prints that she often uses in her adult life as inspiration for her works. Her acclaimed Folded series, for instance, is reminiscent of the ancient Japanese art of origami, as the artist used folded paper to represent time spent in the studio. Every paper was folded a number of times that corresponds with the date in the month - once for the first day of the month, two times for the second, etc.     In a way, Tracy Adams is a creator of her own world. Deeply personal, her work represents a unique type of visual diary as the artist externalizes her internal thoughts and emotions trough her abstract paintings and prints that will be exhibited in the gallery. Tracy Adams is inspired by contradictions, like the tension between organic and the geometric that's often visible in the artist best works. In 2014 around the same time that her folded series, was born she also begun to experiment with the technique of creating monotypes. She was attracted by the possibility of creating beautiful new works momentarily by pressing one surface against the other and produced hundreds of monotypes by employing the same technique.   In her interviews, Tracy Adams often states that her neighboring coasts of California are one of her main influences as she often depicts wonders of the sea in her images. Her new project about medicines from the sea was inspired by scientific researchers of micro-organisms collected during ocean dives. These organisms are being researched for medical purposes as scientists believe that they can make a big break-trough in curing some of the hardest medical lines of young and adult population such as cancer, malaria, AIDS, and similar diseases. The artist was awarded Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant for this particular project. Tracey Adams is represented by IdeelArt gallery.

Stephen Maine,"A notable member of the American Abstract Artists, Stephen Maine is an abstract painter, writer, curator and teacher. Among all of his cultural activities, the way his paintings engage and extend contemporary ideas about color, composition, surface and process makes them the definite highlight of Maine's creative career. Besides the aforementioned experimentations with the medium of painting, Stephen also investigates the potentials and limitations of both the surface of the piece and the process of making it.   In order to achieve such an impressive control over abstract art that he possesses today, Stephen Maine attended numerous schools and faculties. He attended classes at Rhode Island School of Design, Hartford Art School, the University of Connecticut School of Fine Arts and the Yale Summer School of Music and Art. His BFA of Painting was achieved at Indiana University, Bloomington, in the year of 1982, whilst Stephen's 2014 MFA is from the Vermont College of Fine Arts. During the course of all those years studying, Maine was developing his incredible visual vocabulary. His paintings are akin to relief printmaking as far as their making process goes. Stephen uses textured surfaces to apply fluid acrylic paint indirectly to a prepared long canvas. Besides the colors, his other common materials are plywood, extruded foam, plastic and glue. Maine has a practice of rolling and brushing wet paint over the plate before pressing it into the canvas using custom-built contraptions to ensure alignment of successive applications. What is integral to his creative process is the idea that the entire surface is treated with paint at the same moment. This sort of technique not only allows a strong visual result but it also prevents the author from interfering too much and compromising the artworks' character. In most cases, however, multiple layers and more complex interactions of hues are called for in order to complete an image. Paint itself, both as color and material, is the primary subject of Stephen’s studio activity. He also finds motivation in the aleatoric elements of his process, which allows his materials and surfaces to collude in the artistic act rather than be scrutinized and dominated by him.   As it was said earlier, Stephen Maine dedicates a lot of his time to various cultural activities. Besides painting and writing, he is also a teacher, currently working at the Parsons School of Design and at the State University of New York at Purchase. It is incredible how Maine is capable of dedicating so much attention to various fields which all require commitment and are time-consuming. Yet, Maine is more than competent of not only balancing his cultural and creative activities but also to be a remarkable asset to all of his chosen professions.

Laura Newman,"Expressing observations and emotions throughout the abstraction in the practice of Laura Newman is a task she carries on with almost architectural precision. The way she juxtaposes the elements and manages brushwork suggests a strong dedication to the very process which is based on the idea of constant refurbishment and the factor of surprise. Newman’s is essentially interested in both introducing new forms and examining the specter of possibilities of transferring various space planes on canvas. Therefore, it can be said that the artist is searching for the new meaning of two-dimensional surface by creating illusionary environments subjected to insertion of spectators thoughts, aspirations or desires.  Laura Newman was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1956. At the Cooper Union School of Art, she received BFA and studied at the California Institute of the Arts and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design Graduate Program, as well. Her academic development was additionally polished after receiving awards and fellowships from The John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, The American Academy in Rome, The New York Foundation for the Arts, Yaddo, The MacDowell Colony, and The American Academy of Arts and Letters. In between 1993 – 1997 she was and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Art in New Haven, and then in 1998, she became an Associate Professor in the Art Department at Vassar College where she is teaching at present.   Apparently, Newman is captivated within the modernist canon of the everlasting reduction and purification of the image, yet her gestures and the way she accesses the material suggests a more open and tame approach. Her large-scale canvases are created primarily with oils and acrylics and smaller works on paper created with ink, watercolors and other mediums. By applying staining, pouring, and a combination of gestural and meticulous mark making, she imprints a certain performative potential to the process by letting go to unexpected results. The selection of ephemeral colors, dynamic forms and various optical effects contribute to the atmosphere of evocative images she produces.   The harmonious and hard-edge geometric spatial arrangements of Laura Newman have rooted in with fine examples of Abstract Expressionism respectively Color Field painting. However, what departs her practice from those influences and makes it upgraded and contemporary is the rather conceptual aspect. The notable motif of the window, as a symbol of entrance or gap to another reality, is dominant in her work for sometimes and reveals the artist’s need to articulate her personal position in space and time. The freedom of open spaces suggests distance and exploration, contemplation and new horizons. As a matter of fact, it seems as if Newman enjoys in the interplay between representation and abstraction in order to obtain harmony and simplicity.[1]   Both academic and artistic achievements of Laura Newman show the continuum of her activity in the past few decades. She has exhibited in multiple solos and group exhibitions in galleries and museums along the US East Coast and in Canada. The University of Arizona or IBM Corporation and several others included the works of Newman in their permanent collections and several important reviews of her exhibitions were published in Artforum and The New York Times. Her outstanding and distinct focus on making calm and contemplative images position her oeuvre as a fine example of contemporary easel painting. The artist is represented by Ideel Art.

Kiki Kogelnik,"Kiki Kogelnik was an Austrian painter, sculptor and printmaker widely considered to be her nation’s most important Pop-related artist despite the fact she has been known to take issue with being considered a part of the Pop art movement. This was primarily because she withheld from relying on the movement’s traditionally commercial subject matter, instead making work that concentrated on emerging technologies such as space travel and missiles. Nevertheless, Kiki Kogelnik did draw her palette and materials from Pop art, so linking her to the last great modern movement is far from a mistake.  Kogelnik began her artistic career at the Galerie Nächst St. Stephan in Vienna in 1961 where she started showing her early abstract works. At the time she was influenced by Serge Poliakoff of the École de Paris. However, Kiki quickly found her own unique genre while surrounded by the Pop art movement's representatives in the Big Apple. During her stay in New York City, Kogelnik was close to Sam Francis, an abstract expressionist who offered another source of inspiration to Kiki, as well as influencing her away from Pop art. Despite the fact she did not agree with many aspects of Pop art, Kiki Kogelnik still spent a lot of time with the movement's representatives, becoming a big part of their group in the process. This close-knit group of artists included the likes of Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Tom Wesselmann, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, among other big names. Her work during that time was strongly influenced by the Pop art colors and materials, resulting in numerous brightly colored, euphoric space-themed paintings.   Unlike the pop artists she considered close friends and colleagues, Kiki Kogelnik avoided the celebration of commerce and quotidian objects. In the 1970s, her focus shifted to what later became known as her Women works, paintings that were specifically addressing the female role portrayed in commercial advertising. Approaching feminist issues with a strong use of irony, humor and a cool pop-art aesthetic, the art of Kiki Kogelnik was so unique that her name quickly became the hot topic on the international scene of art. In the year of 1974, she also began to work occasionally with ceramics, employing sculptural form as an extension of her painterly concepts. During the next decade, fragmented people, signs and symbols begin to fill Kogelnik’s portfolio and she also directed a short 16mm B&W film CBGB that featured Jim Carroll. The 1990s were a time Kiki would depict highly abstracted yet expressive faces. She also dedicated a lot of time to developing her sculptures - Kogelnik created a series of glass sculptures through which she sought to comment on decorative and commercial themes in art-making. Kiki Kogelnik died of cancer on the 1st of February in the year of 1997, in Vienna.    Observing the world from a critical feminist perspective, Kogelnik made works that offer a timeless commentary on the portrayal of women in promotional media. A long and rich career that started with expressive roots of Art Informal and finished with Pop-like pieces, the work of Kiki Kogelnik is a true hallmark of Austrian art and a feministic milestone that heavily influenced the roles women had in the world of art. However, it also put art historians in a bit of a predicament as this artist’s name deserves to be mentioned along the lines of Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, but doing so would be going against the wishes of the great Kiki Kogelnik.

Elena Monzo,"The ephemeral society and the feminine figures are the most recurrent topics in the research work of Elena Monzo. They are described in each side of their obsession: the out-fit to comply with the mass culture standards and the maniacal attention to details. This new series of works is discovering the maturity and evolution of the artist in the research work about the female figure in nowadays society. The artist undergoes a profound analysis of commonly accepted patterns of this society, challenging them with the same tools: glitters, make-up, shocking colors, textiles and fashion images. The result is a collage work creating new and unconventional individuals I would say, both sex-symbols (singers, actress, models from gossip magazines and fashion world) and odd individuals (drag queens, transgender, circus contortionists) of our society.  The clash between what is accepted and not-accepted explodes with its huge power on the works on paper. The development of the collage technique is remarkable: the artist takes confidence with new materials and tools that merge perfectly with her unique drawing ability. The line on the white surface emerges sharp and clean, no hesitation is showed. Seems like she translates clearly the female idea in her mind onto the surface. ",216
Peterson Kamwathi,"Peterson Kamwathi is an established Kenyan artist known for his painterly-based practice saturated with social, political or environmental references. By exploring and employing various archives, layering them in a specific order, Kamwathi constructs strong figurative narratives which tackle both the personal and collective experience. With his symbolic, yet conceptual works often produced in series, the artist tends to explore the local historical burden of colonialism and its effects and the global contemporary issues. Kamwathi was part of various residencies, exhibited in other African and European countries and the US, and was part of the Nairobi Art Trusts’ Amnesia Project and the Jet-Lag experiment project in 2008 and 2009.

Artur Lescher,"A Brazilian visual artist, Artur Lescher has been making austere, poetic sculptures, objects, and installations since the 1980s, exploring the mechanics of form and movement, balance and tension, and architectural spaces. Transcending their sculptural character, his pieces crossbreed the boundaries of installations and objects to modify the understanding of these categories. Lescher was born in 1962 in São Paulo, where he currently lives and works. He participated in the 1987 and 2002 editions of the Bienal de São Paulo and in the 2005 Mercosul Biennial.

Reflecting direct influences from Constructivism, Suprematism, the Brazilian Neo-Concrete movement, Performance Art and Minimalism, Lescher has been playing with the perception of materials and spaces. His works juxtapose solid geometrical structures and materials with changeable elements such as water, olive oil, and salt. Focusing on perceived boundaries and continuously breaking them down, he created artworks that transform the space creating new planes and engaging the viewer into different perspective. ",225

He received his Masters from The Chelsea College of Art at the University of the Arts, London. He has participated in many prestigious international group exhibitions from London, to Berlin, Dubai and throughout Asia. In late 2010 and early 2011, he had works displayed in the 12th Cairo Biennale. His work is in many notable international collections.  Carver explained his art seems to engage with what Slavoj Žižek has described as ""an awareness that we live in an insulated artificial universe"", at a place and time where perhaps something is ""out of joint"". He often explores painted, fictional interior spaces, referring to them as ""liminal places, often loaded, detailed compositions, complete with paintings within the paintings."" Exquisite and arresting works, Carver's paintings evoke otherworldly narratives. ",227
Gabriele Huesgen,"In her informal, process-oriented style of painting and crafting, Gabriele Huesgen (Gabriele Hüsgen) is a German artist who draws from her emotional fundus. “This personal touch defines both color design and direction and is the basis for expressive works with different levels, fractures and zones. Using my own creational process, I aim to melt these elements so that they grow together and build an overall whole.” After her studied in humanities and arts, Huesgen worked as a teacher, also completing further artistic education in painting as a master student. She has been in a long-standing cooperation with the artist group eigenART and initiated as well as participated in various other art projects. Besides her never-ending love for painting, she always had a passion for object art, which lead her to join a master goldsmith and learn his trade. She is based in Essen and is a member of the producer gallery dieserART in Essen’s liveliest neighborhood. Her paintings, sculptures, and jewelry have been exhibited internationally.

Desiree Patterson,"Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Desirée Patterson is a Canadian photographic artist known for her unique aesthetic approach. She creates compositional works that highlight the fundamental, humanistic connection to the natural world, in attempts to foster awareness for the importance of environmental preservation. Through her work, the artist strives to present an insightful allegory of our relationship with nature, contrasted with the realization of human consumption and the impact we have on the planet. Patterson’s process consists of digital image and meticulous, post manipulation of form, shape, and orientation, turning disparate layers of imagery into unified compositions laced with conceptual narratives.

Janise Yntema,"Janise Yntema is an American abstract painter who works with the ancient technique of encaustic wax, a combination of beeswax, resin, and pigments in which heat serves as the active solvent. After studying at the Art Students League in New York, Yntema earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree from Parsons School of Design/The New York School in New York City in 1984.  Yntema applies natural beeswax and resin to wooden panels, using a blowtorch to seamlessly blend her brush strokes. With close attention to process itself, she creates her images through slow and deliberate accumulations of semi-transparent layers of colour. Light permeates these layers and becomes compositionally present. Heat invisibly dilutes, mixes, and binds each layer into a translucent luminous tone. The application and removal of material, in an additive/reductive process, allows unexpected moments to emerge in an alchemical dance between what is directed and what is uncontrolled. There is a sublime quality in her work as she creates an environment of diffused light that remains minimal and abstract. The element of time is evident.  Yntema’s visual language is inspired by how light, perceived through pigment, creates space in combination with how perceptions of time can be retained through colour. Her work references Postmodern Tonalism. Her paintings bring to question the line between figuration and abstraction as within the visual language of the horizontal, a sense of place is suggested. Her paintings are concerned with what is perceived as real comparative to the ideal, an examination into the larger reality of nature and life.   Yntema extensive exhibition history includes solo and group shows in London, New York City, Brussels, and Amsterdam. Recent solo exhibitions include Le Paysage Tranquille at Galerie Marie Demange, Brussels, in 2016, and The Quiet Landscape, at Cadogan Contemporary, London, UK, in 2015. Her work is included in numerous public and private collections, including that of the Philips Corporation, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. The artist is represented by Ideelart.  ",231
Mel Bochner,"An American artist, Mel Bochner is one of the pioneers of Conceptual Art. He is best known for the so-called Thesaurus paintings, which consist of synonyms displayed together Born in 1940 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Bochner currently lives and works in New York City. In high school, Bochner studied Art with Joseph Fitzpatrick. He received his BFA in 1962 and honorary Doctor of Fine Arts in 2005 from the School of Art at Carnegie Mellon University. Bochner studied philosophy for a short time at Northwestern University in Chicago. After moving to New York, he began working as a guard at the Jewish Museum and then teaching art history at the School of Visual Arts. His first exhibition Working Drawings And Other Visible Things On Paper Not Necessarily Meant To Be Viewed As Art was held in this school in 1966. Featuring photocopies of working drawings from his friends placed into four black binders on four pedestals, it was seen as a defining example of the Conceptual Art movement. Bochner soon began to explore the usage of words in fine art, and the intersection between painting and language. He introduced language to the visual aspect of art, asking and exploring many interesting and novel questions, such as who is the audience and who is the speaker of the words. Through these works and more recent Thesaurus series, the artist examined words’ ability to muddy meaning.",232
David Drebin,"David Drebin is a Canadian photographer, known for his glamorous advertising and fashion photography, which invites the viewer into a metropolitan nightlife of champagne and luxury. Drebin was born in 1970 in Toronto, Canada. After successfully completing the Parsons School of Design in New York City in 1996, David Drebin rapidly made a name for himself as an internationally renowned photographer creating images of movie stars, sports personalities and various entertainers and subsequently was commissioned for countless high profile advertising campaigns around the world. Among his exclusive circle of customers are businesses such as American Express, Davidoff, Mercedes, MTV, Nike, and Sony. His works are published in magazines such as Elle, GQ, Marie Claire, New York Times, Rolling Stone, Travel and Leisure, and Vanity Fair. David Drebin captures the ephemeral quality of beauty and dignity through his documentarian style of photography. The attractive, and often lonesome woman, is often the focal point as she is placed amidst an unusual environment marked by a cinematic backdrop. The photographer underlines the staged nature of his scenes using harsh contrasts of light and color. Drebin's photographs are epic, dramatic and, above all, cinematic. In a unique and opulent way, Drebin stages attractive women against the gigantic backdrops of cities such as Hong Kong, New York, and Paris. The panorama of the big cities, which, due to their format, are a tribute to cinema, serve as gigantic settings. With their impressive skyscrapers, they provide the viewer with a nearly infinite surface for the imagination. In a unique manner, David Drebin's work combines voyeuristic and psychological viewpoints. His intention is to liberate the viewer from the system of rules of everyday life and restore his faith, emotion, and humanity. The distinctive tension and depth in his pictures arise from the free combination of such differing topics as humor, sex and melancholy. Drebin’s first comprehensive illustrated book, Love and Other Stories, was published in 2007, and signaled his transformation from commercial photographer to art photographer. Since 2004, his work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions across Europe and United States. The photographer is currently based in New York.

Harold Town,"A Canadian abstract painter, Harold Town is best known as a member of Painters Eleven, a group of abstract artists active in Toronto from 1954-1960. A brilliant figure in Canadian art from the 1950s to the 1980s, he explored a variety of media and styles. Born in 1924 in Toronto, Town was trained at Western Technical-Commercial School and Ontario College of Art, both in Toronto. The Royal Ontario Museum served as an early inspiration source, where he marveled at the Oriental prints and ceramics, the grandeur of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian antiquities acquired by archaeologist C.T. Currelly, and the suits of European and samurai armor. He coined the name of the group Painters Eleven for their show at the Roberts Gallery in 1954. After William Ronald moved to New York in 1955 and resigned the group, Town became the leading artist among Painters Eleven in terms of international and museum recognition for his work. Initially working in a dark expressionist style, Town moved quickly to abstraction which contrasted vivid colors. He rigorously explored a wide range of contemporary and historical styles, while assimilating complex artistic traditions, which he used to reflect his own personal experience. In 1958, he won the commission for a large mural for Ontario Hydro’s Robert H. Saunders Generating Station on the St. Lawrence Seaway at Cornwall. Symbolizing the clash between the forces of nature and the human intellect, the mural features bristling mechanical forms and scooping curves that drew on his observations of work at the site. ",239

Banksy,"What started as a subculture on the streets of New York in the 1970s has emerged as a significant art movement in the decades since. Today, street art is often viewed as one the most popular forms of art across the globe. Amongst a number of multitalented artists who emerged with the rise of street art, one of the most popular, yet most mysterious, creatives in the street art circles definitely is Banksy, an English-born graffiti master, activist, filmmaker, and painter, who prefers to remain incognito. He initially garnered fame for his graffiti which combines spray paint and stenciling techniques with commercial, and political imagery, infused with ironic social commentary and humor. His pieces can be found in cities across the globe featuring subjects like rats, apes, policemen, members of the royal family, and children. In addition to his two-dimensional work, Banksy is known for his installation artwork, as well as for his use of copyrighted material and subversion of classic images.  He is believed to be a native of Yate, South Gloucestershire, near Bristol and to have been born in 1974, but there is substantial public uncertainty about his identity and personal and biographical details. This multifaceted British street artist, who also works as a painter, a film director, and a political activist, began his career in the early 1990s as a freehand graffiti artist writing on the walls of his hometown of Bristol. During his early years, he worked as a part of Bristol's DryBreadZ Crew (DBZ). He admired works of Blek le Rat, one of the first graffiti artists in Paris, as well as Nick Walker's, his fellow citizen and colleague. He drew inspiration from the local street artists like Inkie and Robert Del Naja, also known as 3D, a graffiti artist and member of the band Massive Attack.   Although his early work was largely freehand, Banksy turned to pre-stenciled work almost completely by the year 2000. This proved to be quite a practical step, as stencils allowed him to create his work much faster and disappear before the police showed up while it also made his art become more widely visible. Over the years, he has created a hugely famous name for himself with his instantly recognizable stencil graffiti featuring clever and striking images that convey subversive anti-establishment messages, usually spiced with humor and irony. At the beginning of his career, the talented artist was trying out names, sometimes signing himself Robin Banx, but this soon evolved into Banksy. Although the shortened moniker may have demonstrated less of the gangsters’ “robbing banks” cachet, it has become the most well-known name in the international art scene.   In 1999, he was headed to London. His first exhibition in the capital city of England took place at Rivington Street in 2001 when he and fellow street artists convened in a tunnel near a pub. They hung up some decorators’ signs “nicked” off a building site and painted the walls white wearing overalls. They got the artwork up in 25 minutes and held an opening party later that week with beers and some hip-hop pumping out of the back of a Transit van. About 500 people turned up to an opening which had cost almost nothing to set up. In July 2003, Banksy mounted Turf War, his breakthrough exhibition. Staged in a former warehouse in Hackney, the show dazzled the London art scene with its carnival atmosphere display, which featured a live heifer, its hide embellished with a portrait of Andy Warhol, as well as Queen Elizabeth II in the guise of a chimpanzee. After the American pop star Christina Aguilera bought a £25000 painting which portrays Queen Victoria as a lesbian, in 2006, an auction record was set for the graffiti artist after a set of Kate Moss paintings were sold in London for £50,400. In the same year, the six colorful silk-screen prints, featuring the British model as Marilyn Monroe, have fetched £50,000 at a Sothebys sale in London although the works had been valued at £10,000. Also in 2006, Max Foster, a journalist who followed the early development of the street art movement, found the term ""the Banksy effect,"" to signify the popularity received by other street artists thanks to his artwork. And, so, the legend was (officially) born.  Banksy's incursion into Los Angeles with the incredibly successful show Barely Legal happened in September 2006. “Hollywood,” he once said, “is a town where they honor their heroes by writing their names on the pavement to be walked on by fat people and peed on by dogs. It seemed like a great place to come and be ambitious.” Crowds of 30,000 or so, among them Brad Pitt, were in attendance. The exhibition centerpiece was an 8,000-pound live elephant, slathered in red paint and overlaid with a fleur-de-lis pattern. No other choice but to compare it to the cult scene in Peter Sellers movie Party, right? L.A.’s outspoken animal-rights advocates were incensed; the authorities ordered the paint to be washed off. Fliers distributed to the glittering crowd made the point that “There’s an elephant in the room...20 billion people live below the poverty line.”  Since 2003, the artist has published several Manifestos on his website. The first few manifestos involved stories from Holocaust, but in time, they became a more random assortment of historical quotations. His worldwide fame has transformed his artwork from acts of vandalism to sought-after high art pieces. Banksy does not sell photographs or reproductions of his street graffiti, but art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder. On February 22, 2007, the day after Sotheby’s London sold three Banksy works, all of which soared above their auction estimates and into the six figures, Banksy updated his website with an image of an auction house and the message, I Can't Believe You Morons Buy This Shit. In the following years, Banksy has continued to make his feeling on the commercialism of his art exceedingly clear. He calls galleries that sell his work “unauthorized”. In 2009, Banksy parted company with agent Steve Lazarides and announced that Pest Control, an appropriately named Banksy organization whose tasks are to authenticate the real Banksy artwork and to protect the artist from prying outsiders. It is, in effect, another extension of the artist’s darkly humorous manifesto. The simple website informs owners, anxious to authenticate and sell their freshly excavated and exceedingly valuable Banksy treasures, that the authentication process is “lengthy and challenging”, as many pieces “are created in an advanced state of intoxication.”  Girl And Balloon is Banksy's most popular art piece. Banksy has created variations on that theme, but the most famous one was discovered in the South Bank of London in 2002 on the wall of a stairway. The original work depicts a schoolgirl losing a heart-shaped balloon to the wind. A small quote was later etched into the staircase that reads ""There is always hope"". Another of his girls appeared back in 2007 in the Exmouth Market, located on Rosebery Avenue in London. ATM Girl was directed at the conduct of Britain's banks at the time - a record-setting profits and high penalty fees. The ATM machine spewed a good amount of his false currency, known as ""Di Faced Tenners"". In 2003, Banksy first created Bomb Hugger, published by Pictures on Walls in London as a limited edition of prints. A similar work has been also found on one London’s East End wall. Bomb Hugger depicts a young girl with a ponytail and a short dress hugging a large bomb. The moppet represents purity and the bomb – war, destruction, and evil. This way, Banksy wanted to challenge the public, press and politicians primarily, for portraying warfare in a positive light, as a way to reach peace. In 2015, one of his girls, a 6ft tall mural of a young moppet pouting, on the side of the North Star pub in Hounslow, west London – was defaced by unknown vandals. The mural is believed to now be worthless after a vandal painted over it so she is now wearing a burka. This girl first appeared in 2007 and it was thought to be worth £100,000. The piece had the word 'smile' in brightly colored letters written above her head. Sadly, now only her eyes remain visible.   Interest in Banksy escalated even more with the release of the 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop. The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, was nominated for an Academy Award. It is a film that tells the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles, and his obsession with street art. There has been debate over whether the documentary is genuine or a mockumentary, although Banksy answers ""Yes"" when asked if the film is real. Banksy has said in interviews that editing the film together was an arduous process, ""I spent a year watching footage of sweaty vandals falling off ladders"" and ""The film was made by a very small team. It would have been even smaller if the editors didn't keep having mental breakdowns. They went through over 10,000 hours of Thierry's tapes and got literally seconds of usable footage out of it."" Producer Jaimie D'Cruz wrote in his production diary that obtaining the original tapes from Thierry was particularly complicated. A movie reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the film could be a new subgenre, a ""prankumentary"". The New York Times described it as paralleling Banksy’s best work: “a trompe l’oeil: a film that looks like a documentary but feels like a monumental con.” The film contains exclusive footage of Banksy, Shepard Fairey, Invader and many of the world's most infamous graffiti artists at work, on walls and in interviews. As Banksy describes it, ""It's basically the story of how one man set out to film the un-filmable. And failed!""  Better Out Than In was a residency undertaken by Banksy in New York City during October 2013. Banksy unveiled, at least, one work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were stencil graffiti and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire. The month-long show was widely publicized and covered by the media.  In 2015, after exactly one decade, Banksy returned to Palestine - Israel troubled zone. In his first visit, in 2005, he has created nine images on Israel's highly controversial West Bank barrier. On his website, Banksy reminded public that Israel's 425-mile-long West Bank barrier, separating Israel from the Palestinian territories, is considered illegal by the United Nations and that it ""essentially turns Palestine into the world's largest open prison."" On his second visit, Banksy made a series of new paintings across ruins in Palestine. He even made a film to go alongside the works, documenting the devastation wrought by Israeli militia and bombing campaigns. The film is titled Make this the year YOU discover a new destination. One of the murals features a kitten sprayed on the remains of a wall, posed playing with a coiled ball of rusted metal as if it were wool: “This cat tells the whole world that she is missing a joy in her life. The cat found something to play with. What about our children?” One incident is involved with the artist's second visit. Police in Gaza have confiscated a door bearing one of the graffiti (depicting Nioba, a Greek goddess, weeping for her dead offspring) after its original owner said he was tricked into selling it for $175 after a complaint was filed by Rabie Darduna against a local artist who bought the door from him. The artist, Bilal Khaled, insisted that the purchase was legal.  Dismaland was a temporary art project organised by Banksy and constructed in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England. Self-described as “entry-level anarchism”, Dismaland offered a depressing antidote of amusement parks such as Disneyland, where irony, satire and truth-speaking artworks created an atmosphere that not everyone enjoyed or got the point of. For the exhibition Banksy made ten new works and funded the construction of the exhibition himself. Among Banksy, fifty eight international names took part in creating this unique experience, including names like Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer and Mike Ross. His Dismaland was opened on 21 August 2015, and closed permanently on September 27, 2015, 36 days later. After closing the bemusement park was dismantled and sent to Calais to become a shelter for the migrants.   The year of 2017 has been quite exciting for Banksy so far. His complex art world was further explored in the lively, involving documentary titled as Saving Banksy, although the stylized onscreen name of the film is $aving Banksy. The filmmakers behind this documentary chose an interesting title as Banksy would seem to be the last person who would need any kind of saving - he is arguably the biggest name in street art right now with an instantly recognizable and respected style. However, the British street artist’s work is in danger and it needs to be protected from an entire list of potential enemies, including the likes of jealous fellow artists, uncomprehending local governments and profit-taking galleries. The story behind Saving Banksy begins in the April of 2010 when Banksy flew to San Francisco and put up a number of pieces all over the city. Unfortunately, these artworks were quickly sabotaged one by one, some by local taggers who put their own work on top of Banksy’s and some by the vigilant city officials who saw all the pieces as nothing more than illegal vandalism and threatened property owners with sizable fines if they did not immediately paint the works over. Although Banksy is not interviewed in this film, several of his fellow street practitioners are. All of them feel that the risk of defacement or destruction is a part of the deal when you decide to take your art to the street, although this fact does not make the entire situation seem any less disrespectful or grim. Ultimately, director Colin M. Day‘s documentary Saving Banksy manages to open the viewers’ eyes by discussing opportunists stealing their work to make a buck or simply destroying the piece. It also presents us with a man that is doing his best to remain true to the work and himself along a journey to preserve what was never meant to be preserved.    Banksy's identity remains unknown, despite intense speculation. The two names most often suggested are Robert Banks and Robin Gunningham. Pictures that surfaced of a man who was supposedly Banksy pointed toward Gunningham, an artist who was born in Bristol in 1973. Gunningham moved to London around 2000, a timeline that correlates with the progression of Banksy's artwork. Another thing about Banksy is his attitude towards high prices of his artwork. He actually doesn’t think it’s possible to make art about world poverty and trouser all the cash. This is why he provided, on his website, high-resolution images of his work for free downloading. Also, not to be forgotten, Time magazine selected Banksy, all-purpose provocateur, for its list of the world’s 100 most influential people in 2010. So, he found himself in the company of Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, and Lady Gaga. He supplied a picture of himself with a paper bag (recyclable, naturally) over his head. Most of his fans don’t really want to know who he is (and have loudly protested Fleet Street attempts to unmask him).

Yoshitomo Nara,"Yoshitomo Nara is one of the most popular Japanese painters who portrayed wide-eyed children and dogs. Along with the painting, he draws, makes sculptures and illustrations. His major breakthrough occurred in 1990's when the Pop art expansion spread across Japan. What he found most appealing is the general acceptance of pop art, which he used to promote somewhat contradictory ideas and subjects. The innocent children with their wide eyes, pastel colors and cute clothes were depicted carrying weapons, showing hostile affinities and breaking the soft image of innocence.  Nara was born in 1959 in Aomori, Japan. In 1985 he graduated from Aichi Prefectural University of Fine Arts and Music and two years later earned an MFA there. He left Japan for Germany where he studied at the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. When he started painting he combined his desire for expression with books and music he loved, creating an explosive fusion of popular culture elements. The most important influences are the manga and anime from the time of his childhood, with their innocent looking characters who go on great adventures. His favorite characters are a little girl and a dog. However, Yoshitomo Nara gave those cute looking figures a different twist, portraying them in dark and mysterious manner, painting them in almost horror like the light. This contradictory composition originated from strict social conventions in Japan, which no one could fight against, so the opposing nature of youngsters and weapons were a perfect medium because of their power to induce strong feelings. Most of the intellectual, creative and artistic members of the modern Japanese society felt the need to rebel against the social oppression imposed by the government however, it had to be done under the veil of free artistic expression no one could censor. His ambition was powered up by his love for punk music, which gave him the energy to be a rebel himself. Nara liked the characteristic spirit of the punk culture, he enjoyed the positive influence they had on young people's attitudes and aspirations, and however, he did not enjoy their rough aesthetics in fullness.   Instead of making his subject punk rock, he wanted to make them appear cute and vulnerable, and in more appealing aesthetics. During his educational years, he came to love Renaissance paintings and literature and often found inspiration in the paintings of old masters. He liked the positive values of Japanese tradition and used it quite often as a source of inspiration. He combined the traditional with contemporary and often used cites from rock and punk songs, graffiti and street art to enrich the motivational background of his work. Growing up in post-World War II Japan gave him to an opportunity to witness social and cultural change, to be part of the generations that were open to Western culture. His mindset was settled for openness, for the ability to incorporate new with traditional, keeping the quality unchanged and both element equally significant. Also, his upbringing was quite modern, as he was able to explore as many books as he wanted. He grew up to be fiercely independent and it determined the fictional nature of his subjects, too. The subjects of his work vary, from the typical allegorical satire to the odd looking wide-eyed kids, whose vulnerability of induces slightly disturbing feelings. The colors are pastel, soft-hued and the lines are bold, similar to the ones they use to portray anime characters.   The main subject is the contradiction, the strange sight of kids carrying weapons, knives, sometimes even displaying famous brand logos on them. The idea is to place weapons instead of toys, in order to show how easily the violent nature of humankind can be awakened. It is enough just to be part of the modern society to encounter some type of violent behavior. Children with weapons are a metaphorical depiction of grown up people who represent the bad kind, the one who would exchange noble ethical principles for acquiring power and wealth. Those are the ones who carry bigger weapons, and can successfully hide behind the seemingly innocent wide-eyed gaze. He develops his idea extremely well and has a major group of followers and appreciation around the globe. Critiques love him, general audience, even more, and fellow artists even feature him in their art, like the band Fantômas did in their album Suspended Animation in 2005. He uses his painting for commercial purposes also, and so far he has published many pieces for magazines, catalogs, and books and had his artwork appear in many videos. In 2010 there was a major retrospective exhibition held in New York, entitled Yoshitomo Nara: Nobody's Fool. From 2001 to 2003 and 2004 to 2005 he had two retrospective exhibitions touring Japan and United states - I Don’t Mind If You Forget Me and the Yoshitomo Nara: Nothing Ever Happens.    With something as simple as the 2D image, minimalist portrait of the moody child, Yoshimoto Nara manages to create something emotional and deep. Pop aesthetics serves him as a platform for the proud presentation of the confident children, whose eyes gaze straight into the viewer, or when they are closed they engage the viewer into the inter-subjective and introspective analysis. Their still glares, cheeky expressions, and cute appearance use the postmodern ability to transfer something deeper without having to sacrifice their simplicity. In pop culture cartoons are not made just for childer, their message resonate among the adults pretty well, so his medium makes perfect sense to those who want to dig deeper for the message and not just label him as sweet, cartoonish artist. The naive aesthetic gives the characters certain appeal, but their facial expression does not imply friendliness and cuteness. They look like the kids who just premeditated some sort of mischief or did something bad, and now are hiding under the veil of presumed innocence. In just one single frame Nara displays his composition of 2D canonization of the human spirit. Those children are grown men in masks, and a perfect example of the social oblivion that misinterprets them as victims and ones who require protection, while they are perfectly safe, ready, willing and able to commit a bad deed. The artist is represented by the Pace Gallery London, Pace Gallery Beijing, Pace Gallery Hong Kong, Pace Gallery Menlo Park, Pop Fine Art Los Angeles and Galerie Fluegel-Roncak.  ",248
Brian Alfred,"An American artist, podcaster, educator and curator, Brian Alfred works fluidly between painting, collages, digital drawing and animation. Working between classic and contemporary media, his subjects range from architecture and technology to modern idealism and romantic heroism. Born in Pittsburgh, PA in 1974, Alfred is currently based in Brooklyn, New York. He received a BFA from Pennsylvania State University in 1997, studied at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Maine and received an MFA from Yale University, New Haven, CT in 1999. His solo exhibitions include those at Miles McEnery Gallery, New York, Maho Kubota Gallery, Tokyo, Ameringer | McEnery | Yohe, New York, Hezi Cohen Gallery, Tel Aviv, Giraud Pissarro Ségalot, New York, Haunch of Venison, London and Studio La Città, Verona. He is the recipient of many awards, including Japan Media Arts Festival Award, Pennsylvania State University Alumni Achievement Award, Joan Mitchell Foundation Award, American Academy of Arts and Letters Purchase Award. Alfred mostly works from photographs, using a computer to reduce images to their essential forms and finally turn them into flattened, bold color fields that retain a handmade feel. He is best known for examining the impact of technology on people's perception of their surroundings, as well as the way people process information.",249

Macyn Bolt,"Relying on an interesting visual vocabulary based on geometric shapes and variations, Macyn Bolt is an American abstract painter. By creating his pieces, this painter desired to explore how color and form, if used properly, create shifts in visual perception. His fascinating painting and installation work mirror the balance between boldness and delicacy, a commonly found feature within this painter's compositions. Macyn Bolt spends his time between Brooklyn and upstate Pennsylvania.   Macyn Bolt earned his education by studying at Calvin College, in Grand Rapids, where he received a BGA after graduating in the year of 1979. Furthermore, he obtained his Masters of Fine Arts from Syracuse University in two years later. Ever since then, Bolt has been working with on developing his artistic style. He uses acrylic paint as a constant material, but his choices of surfaces do vary - Macyn utilizes canvas, wood panel, vinyl and paper, depending on the situation at hand. He creates layers of paint which result in a canvas surface that seems both polished and hand made. Additionally, Bolt also strives to achieve heightened areas via the effect of contrast. Because of such characteristics, his acrylic work has often been regarded as the work of exploring relationships between the painterly and the flat. Another important aspect of his work is scale and the size of the work holds a lot of its identity within. Macyn's smaller works, which start around 16 x 15 inches in size, create opportunities for intimate and private interactions. However, his larger works which have been known to range up to 84 x 180 inches, encompass viewers in a contemplative aesthetic space. That way, Bolt is able to change the audience's perceptual experiences which are an integral part of his pieces and the meaning behind them. In his own words, he desires to unveil the qualities of reflection and mirroring that are unique to the space of the abstract painting. Macyn Bolt has exhibited in multiple solo and group exhibitions throughout the United States, never failing to attract attention wherever he and his work went. Furthermore, Macyn's pieces have managed to find their way into many corporate and institutional collections, including those of the Newark Museum, Grand Rapids Museum, the Blanton Museum, the Boca Raton Museum, Progressive Companies, the Janet Turner Print Museum, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and TIAA-CREF. This kind of recognition only further solidifies Bolt's significance to the contemporary scene.     Macyn's greatest inspiration comes from the visual riddle that can be evoked by spatial relationships between elements of the composition. Bolt's reductive and monochromatic works are impressive to behold and offer fascinating shifts in visual perception which can be both dramatic and nuanced. Furthermore, this painter invites the audience along on a ride as he explores his concepts, allowing the viewers to interact with the fluctuating polarities of concrete and illusionary space.

JR,"Perhaps one of the most important purposes that art may be used towards is bringing people together and increasing awareness of those that share this world with us. Trying to accomplish exactly that with his artistic practice, the French artist going by his initials of JR uses the biggest museum in the world to carry his ideas across - the streets of the cities across the globe. Merging together photography and street art, his publicly displayed works charged with emotion and heavy social issues are heralds of change in the reality formed by preconceptions built by advertising and the media.   JR’s artistic involvement started out with graffiti, as he adored the movement and its realization even as a boy. Born in 1983, JR would graffiti tag the street walls and subway passages of Paris during his teen days using the moniker Face 3. It wasn’t until he found a camera on the subway that he turned to photography, as it completely changed his perception of the known practice of street art. More than just creating graffiti of his own, he was able to capture the work he has made as well as pieces produced by other fellow artists, tracking the individuals and communication produced through this display. It would prove to leave a mark on his entire further career, as he remains known for carrying messages between groups of people through his publicly displayed works.   Camera in hand, JR had developed his photographic skills until an event that would not only propel him in the eye of the world art scene but also further define his approach to visual expression. The riots that broke out in the suburbs (banlieues) of Paris in 2004 gave JR a chance to capture the faces of those involved, largely comprised of the immigrant population. The project consisted of posting these images in larger proportions throughout the city, humanizing an otherwise discriminated group of people by portraying emotion and character. The up-close photographs containing a background of many present social issues have become a signature mark for the artist, and he has emphasized the problems of equality, freedom, and identity in his work thus far.   After drawing attention with his initial project, JR kept walking the path of averting the public gaze towards some well known, yet overlooked social issues. Often using his camera with a 28mm wide-angle lens, JR’s subjects are photographed close and personal, utterly revealing the essence of their emotions - the pain, the happiness, the sorrow that we all felt at some point in our lives. By leaving nothing but the basic nature of people that we can all relate to, JR speaks a universal language that can be understood on a scale wider than the boundaries presented by region, nationality, religion, education or age. His large-scale works bring forth the essential elements of humanity that connect us but tend to be buried under the guise of social norms. All of these traits have been present in his practice that consists of displaying the photographs blown up in proportions as part of street art. Crossing the boundary of legal actions in order to realize his work, his “public exhibitions” draw tensions and issues to the forefront. His 2006 Portrait of a Generation project consists of images of African immigrants after the riots in the suburbs of Paris; in 2007, JR pasted large images of cheerful Palestinians and Jews on the opposite sides of the bridge that separates them in a project titled Face 2 Face; the 2008 public exhibition Women are Heroes included images of communities’ women stricken by the effects of war, violence, and poverty; the 2022 Valeriia project in which the artist unfurled the large scale photograph of five-year-old Valeriia in front of the national Opera in Lviv, protesting the war in Ukraine.  These, and other projects conducted by the artist, all stand as a representation of his ideas and ideology, and the will to change the reality we live in.   Constantly telling the stories of those that are invisible to the world, JR seeks to turn it inside out through art and its possibilities, such as The Past Goes Fast (2022), where he had a conversation with Robert De Niro in the fully preserved painting studio of the actor's father; or the large-scale mural The Chronicles of New York City (2019), which featured portraits of several hundred New Yorkers. Employing street art and photography in his practice, he uses the biggest gallery in the world - the streets - to further his goal. Often crossing the line of the law, the artist displays on the streets of Middle East, the walls in slums of Paris, bridges of Africa and favelas of Brazil, pulling a thread between his subjects, the art as a medium, and those observing it. Much like in his days as a teen, JR claims his works to be a form of tagging - pasting faces of personas onto the walls hoping for a change. By putting his practice in-between the two sides, the project he took upon himself carries over to those that are now aware of it.  ",252
Tracey Emin,"To be honored by the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, the order of chivalry given by the monarchy, requires some pretty outstanding achievements in the fields of art and science. Let’s just put it this way – it is far, far away from being an easy task. Well, for a British artist Tracey Emin, obtaining the Dame Grand Cross title came as a result of many years spent in exploring and contemplating her troubled childhood and teenage years. She managed to create numerous series of provocative and controversial art pieces, from paintings and textiles to sculpture and video.  Tracey Emin, a Member of Royal Academy was born in Croydon, at the time a part of Surrey.  A family on her mother's side was of the Romanichal descent. Romnichals, Rumnichals or Rumneys is a Romani sub-group arrived in England in the 16th century. Their origins go all the way to India, specifically Rajasthan, from where they started migrating westwards in the 11th century. Tracey was brought up in Margate, a seaside town in the district of Thanet in Kent. Her father was a Turkish Cypriot, an ethnic Turk originating from Cyprus, who was married to another woman, dividing his time between the two families he created. He was running his own Hotel International in Margate, but his business failed, leaving both of his families to struggle and overcome a severe decline in their standard of living. This was the event that left a huge impact on Tracey’s growing up, and featured in many of her works. Emin enrolled the fashion course at the Medway College of Design in 1980. There she met Billy Childish, her boyfriend to be, who persuaded her to join The Medway Poets, a British punk-based performance art group in Medway, North Kent. Next few years, Tracey spent working as an administrator for Hangman Books, specialized in Children's poetry, until she decided to pursue a career in art. In 1989, she graduated from Maidstone College of Art. Next year, Emin moved to London to study at the Royal College of Art, obtaining an MA in painting. In the future, Tracey couldn’t find any nice words to describe this period of time, marking it as a very negative experience. She emerged herself into the troubled worlds of Munch and Schiele, creating one of her own as well. Later, when she already studied modern philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London, Tracey burned all of her paintings done by then, in hope to somehow seal forever that dark period in her life.  With her close friend and a fellow artist, Sarah Lucas, Emin established The Shop, at the London's East End, where they even had a fish pond and a David Hockney altarpiece called Our David. The shop worked  every Tuesday to Friday during the day, and Saturdays from 11 pm to a late Sunday afternoon – the pubs on Saturday were closing around 11, so go figure why… The Shop owners Emin and Sarah shared the same bawdy humor and energy, so the Bethnal Green days were just filled with parties. The best one, or should we say the epic one, was at the closing, on Tracey’s 30th birthday. The theme was She's Just About Old Enough to Do Whatever She Wants! The Shop was a place where Tracey Emin met her future art dealer - Jay Jopling, a man who established the original White Cube in 1993, in London’s West End – a place of Emin’s first solo show titled My Major Retrospective was held in 1994. The autobiographical exhibit consisted of photographs, pictures of earlier paintings and other personal objects, including a pack of cigarettes her uncle was holding when he was killed in a car crash. A loud public display of her intimate life details very quickly became Emin’s trademark.   In 1995, Tracey Emin created her piece Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995, also titled The Tent, from obvious reason - the entire work was conceptualized as a tent with 102 names applied. Names of all the people Tracey has been sleeping with, at a stated period of time. When we say sleeping, we don’t mean it in a sexual way only. There is also a name of her grandmother for example, with whom she slept in the same bed holding her hand. Tracey enumerated every person she exchanged any trace of intimacy and love with. Emin refused to sell this piece directly to Charles Saatchi, as she was disgusted with his advertising work for Margaret Thatcher, accused him of nothing less but crimes against humanity. However, her contempt did not stop Saatchi from buying it on the secondary market at a premium price of £40,000, that is £28,000 more than Emin’s original price! Everyone I Have Ever Slept With achieved an iconic status but unfortunately, was destroyed in the 2004 Momart London warehouse fire. Of course, Tracey Emin refused to recreate it.   In 1997, Emin, still relatively unknown at the time, made headlines when she appeared intoxicated in a television interview, in which she spoke about recipients of the esteemed Turner Prize. Emin was shortlisted for the prize two years later. She later said that she wasn’t even aware she was on television, 18 years after a spectacular performance in a TV debate. As Waldemar Januszczak and Roger Scruton tried to argue about conceptual art, Emin declared, among other nuggets: Don’t you understand? I want to be free. Get this fucking mike off!   Young British Artists (YBAs) is pretty much a loose group of artists who started exhibiting together in 1988, when Damien Hirst curated an exhibition of his friends and contemporaries titled it Freeze, at Surrey Docks. They became notorious for their spontaneous openness to materials and processes, some shock tactics and entrepreneurial attitude. Most of them attended Goldsmiths College in London. Group’s name Young British Artists derives from shows of that name organized at the Saatchi Gallery from 1992 onwards. Tracey belongs to the second wave of Young British Artists that came in 1992. The exhibitions like New Contemporaries, New British Summertime, and Minky Manky, launched a second group that included Douglas Gordon, Christine Borland, Fiona Banner, Tacita Dean, Georgina Starr and Jane and Louise Wilson.   In 2014, Tracey Emin’s best known work, her 1998 monument to the heartache of a relationship breakdown, My Bed, has gone on display at Tate Britain for the first time in 15 years. The Bed that the artist today describes as a portrait of a young womanwas bought for £2.54m at Christie’s, by the German businessman and collector Count Christian Duerckheim. This art lover loaned Emin’s art piece to the Tate for a decade at least.  Duerckheim explained what drove him to buy My Bed - it is a metaphor for life, where troubles begin and logics die, he said. This work lives on as a work that defined the turbulent British art of the 90s. Having in mind that the famous Hirst’s shark shriveled and Rachel Whiteread’s House was demolished, the future generations will get to look at Tracey’s Bed when exploring British art at the end of the 20th century. The artwork attracted considerable attention and media furor at the time. Regardless its contribution to the honesty in art, sheets stained with bodily secretions and the bed surrounded by some extremely personal things, like used condoms or panties with menstrual period stains, the work didn’t gain the understanding of a mainstream public and press. The bed was presented in the state that Emin claimed it had been when she had not got up from it for more than few days, due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship difficulties.In 1999, using Japanese tourists as their cover, two Chinese artists, Cai Yuan and Jian Jun Xi (who work together under the name Mad For Real),  bounded half-naked on to Tracey Emin's My Bed at the Tate Gallery, had a slightly half-hearted pillow fight and then shouted something unfathomable in Mandarin. Unfortunately, Xi and Chai were unable to perform the ""critical sex"" they had hinted at. Earlier both men had said they felt a sexual act was necessary to fully respond to Tracey's piece.   That same year, she organized a themed exhibition titled Temple Of Diana, which featured a series of drawings based on the life of Princess Diana. The Temple of Diana was located, appropriately enough, in Knightsbridge, where the People's Princess lived and shopped. The genesis of the piece was in the holy temples of India where the curator of the show, Neal Brown, was greeted by Indians on several occasions with a single fervently whispered word - Diana.  Tracey created a series of eight lithographs whose titles seem to tell a story: They wanted you to be destroyed; Single- handed; Hard Luck, Diana; Landmines; Oh, Diana; That stupid dress they made you wear; Death of a Princess; Looking for a postcard of Diana. To produce each lithograph, Emin used a sheet of glass, a sheet of paper and an etching tool to scrawl text and accompanying imagery. She had to write backward so that the text ends up the correct way around, looking a bit awkward and naive. In 1999, Emin had her first solo exhibition in the United States at Lehmann Maupin Gallery, entitled Every Part of Me's Bleeding. Later that year, she was a Turner Prize nominee where she exhibited My Bed .  Tracey Emin is an exquisite storyteller, she manages to engage the viewer with her candid exploration of both personal and universal emotions. Through her so-called confessional art, Tracey reveals some of the most intimate life details, showing an impressive ability to connect her work and personal life, sharing the intimacy with the viewer. Her ready-mades are always hand-made – starting with her tent, to her wooden fairground structures reminiscent of Emin´s seaside childhood. Behind all that conceptualism she’s is, let us not forget, a trained figurative artist who studied painting at the Royal College of Art: she hated it but learned a lot about painting, as she later claimed.  Tracey Emin’s art is one of disclosure - inspired by her personal life events, she creates pieces that are ranging from painting, drawing, video and installation, to photography, needlework and sculpture. Emin’s dreams, humiliations, failures or successes are presented with brutal honesty and without a trace of romanticizing, they are both tragic and humorous. Her often sexually provocative attitude firmly locates her oeuvre within the tradition of feminist discourse. By re-inventing conventional handicraft techniques, so-called women’s work, and introducing it to the world of contemporary art, her art resonates with the feminist tenets of the ‘personal as political’. In 2011, her largest major solo exhibition, Love is What You Want, was held at the Hayward Gallery in London. The exhibition surveyed paintings, drawings, textiles, sculptures and videos that Emin had produced throughout her career.   In 2015, a comprehensive exhibition presenting more than 80 works by this artist was held at the Leopold Museum in Vienna. The show titled Where I Want to Go linked Emin’s work and that of Egon Schiele, her inspiration from the beginning of the career. It was the exhibition of her oeuvre, done in many different mediums, included paintings, gouaches, videos, neon installations, bronze sculptures, and photographs, as well as wood, metal, and textile pieces. Emin herself chose a series of paintings and drawings by the Austrian expressionist to hang beside her works, giving visitors the opportunity to explore the parallels between the two artists. As Tracey said, this exhibition was a dream come true, as Schiele was her own personal hero ever since she first heard of him, when she was 15. To have his works hanged by the side of hers was something she never hoped for.   Emin released few autobiographical films, focusing on her troubled childhood and teenage years. She's written several books, as well – a most popular one was her 2005 memoir titled Strangeland. In 2007, Emin was inducted into the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and in 2011, she was appointed as a professor of drawing. In her 2015 interview, she described the process of preparing My Bed to once again go on display at Tate Britain, when she had to climb again beneath its sheets in order to restore the correct degree of rumpled disarray – Tracey said that the fabric had stiffened over time and that was exactly how she felt about this work. The bed’s potential to shock maybe has drained a bit during the 16 years since it was shortlisted for the Turner prize but, her ability to surprise the public over and over again did not, new work just keeps coming.   One of her more recent projects is a line of jewelry designed with Stephen Webster. As always, her unique touch can be found in all its glory in these tiny works of art and its exquisite forms. Even as a jewelry designer, Emin couldn’t (or wouldn’t) skip this opportunity to shock: a tiny 18-carat gold penis hanging from the charm bracelet was quite enough. Other ornaments include a frog, a hare, and a cat. But, let us not be quick to judge: phallus often appeared in Roman art and Celtic magic as a protective charm. But, then again, could she create something that won’t raise a few eyebrows? Probably not. In 2008, Tracey Emin established an International Shop, the online boutique selling limited edition prints, books and everyday objects designed and created by her. There is one saying that goes pretty well with this YBA-generation enfant terrible. It is in Romani language, the one her family on the mother’s side used to speak: Mo dir Devel si Kushko, t’a nai o Beng basavo kek odolen kai kamela. Meaning: God is good, and the Devil is not so bad to those whom he likes.   Featured images copyright © Rune Hellestad/Corbis via The Guardian",253
Gregor Hildebrandt,"A German contemporary artist, Gregor Hildebrand uses cassette tape and vinyl records as his medium, applying them directly onto canvases and photographic prints and in room-sized installations. Born 1974 in Bad Homburg, Germany, Gregor Hildebrandt currently lives and works in Berlin, Germany. He graduated from Hochschule der Künste, Berlin in 2002, after he studied previously at the University of Mainz. Hildebrandt was awarded a Studienstiftung scholarship in 1998 and received a scholarship at the Deutsches Studienzentrum in& Venice the following year, while still a student. Hildebrandt uses cassette tape and vinyl records collages and assembles into apparently minimalist yet latently romantic paintings, sculptures, and installations, making impressions with them onto the canvas before finally adhering them to create what he calls ""the negative painting."" He often shapes vinyls into bowls to create what he described a ""sonic wall made of pillars of records."" In his work, he references music, film, literature and, last but not least, art history, combining and intertwining different pictorial associations. “I really love that there’s something inside the material that you can’t hear,” he explained. “And when you see it, you only see black. You can have your own interpretation of the materials and it does something for your experience.” ",254
Fieroza Doorsen,"Fieroza Doorsen is a South African – British abstract artist who is putting an emphasis in her work on pattern and colored forms, while investigating mark-making, spatial relations and formal contrasts at the same time.  Fieroza Doorsen was born in South Africa and in 1984 she received a BA in fine art at Ravensborne College of Art, London, just to earn later, in 1985 a master in printmaking at Chelsea School of Art, London. Fieroza Doorsen experiments with a wide range of materials such as: charcoal, ink, pastel, oil, acrylic, gouache, collage - just to name a few, producing works on paper, oil on canvases and wall based sculptures.  Her visual language is decidedly abstract, but it is also grounded in familiar, expression-based calligraphic marks. Doorsen uses drawing as a way for investigation of ideas and shapes, playing with curves and lines, organic forms in both color and monochrome. Her artistic approach has certain similarities with Arte Povera because she imbues old objects with a new purpose.  Doorsen has been experimented with figurative imagery since the beginning of her career, but she almost always comes back to abstraction. Her work is present in many international public and private collections including the Penguin Collection London and the Deedee Rose Collection in Dallas. During her career, she mostly has exhibited in the UK but her work has also been displayed in France, the US and Italy.   In 1984 Fieroza Doorsen has been a part of an exhibition titled Creation for Liberation – 2nd Open Exhibition by Black Artists. Creation for Liberation was a cultural organization of black artists based in Railton Road, Brixton. It was one of four exhibitions that were organized by them in Brixton, London from 1983 through to 87. Besides Doorsen, the artists in show were all members of the collective Creation for Liberation: Sylvan Alleyne, Ankobra, Rasheed Araeen, Paddi Arts, Paul Barrett, Ron Best, Percival Blake, Tyrone Bravo, Chila Burman, Tony Moo-Young, Ibi Taylor, Gerald Telman, Shanti Thomas, David Trotman, Errol Walker, Tony Walliston, Ansell Walters, Audrey West, John Wilkie, Godfrey Williams…  This collective wanted to emphasize the cultural dimension to struggles of the black community, reflected in many areas of art, performing arts, film and even sport. This cultural expression did not only draw from the African, Caribbean and Asian heritage, but as well from British and European traditions. Creation of Liberation aimed to establish a sound intellectual and cultural bridgehead to assist others to transcend and transform bankruptcy of cultural and intellectual life in Britain – and did so by organizing cultural events and discussions as well as recording, publishing and promoting the creative talents of the artists.   In 2013, Doorsen’s work on Emergence group exhibition was very much noted and praised by both viewers and critics. This reductive abstract painting show was on view at Hôtel de Sauroy, and it was curated by Katrin Bremermann, Erin Lawlor and Yifat Gat.  Emergence featured work by an international group of painters who enriched a simple geometric mark making with substantial complexity.  The exhibition statement said that ""In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence is the way complex systems and patterns arise out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions. Emergence is central to the theories of integrative levels and of complex systems."" The list of artists included Eve Aschheim, A.T Biltereyst, Katrin Bremermann, Sharon Butler, Claire Chesnier, Clem Crosby, Fieroza Doorsen, Amy Feldman, Yifat Gat, Kevin Monot, Erin Lawlor, Paul Pagk, Marine Pages, Andrew Seto, Radu Tuian, Richard Van der Aa, Don Voisine, and Michael Voss.  In 2014 Doorsen presented a solo exhibition simply titled Works on paper at the Wilson Stephens and Jones fine and decorative art. The pieces exhibited played with curves and lines, color and monochrome. In this small gallery all the works were hanged closely, offering very lively and interesting juxtaposition.    Doorsen also proved herself in the field of commercial art by creating a collection of rugs named Cordoba Collection. This collection was curated by Filippo Tattoni-Marcozzi and made exclusively for MADE – a Soho company that works with fresh design talent to create an unique furniture collection. Fieroza Doorsen's pieces are simply her art expression elegantly translated onto rugs. In her career, she was awarded with British Council Award and Grants to Artists. Since March 2015, she has been represented by IdeelArt.  ",255

Margaret Neill,"Abstract art is often misunderstood as it is most often non-representational and the viewers don’t quite know what is in front of them. At first glance, the work of Margaret Neill is simply an exploration of the possibilities of the line, but, when given a second or a third look, it is clearly an entire world described through those exact lines. The viewers are invited to join in her expedition as she discovers and portrays her relationship with time and space. She observes the patterns, both natural phenomena and human-made, such as weather patterns, maps or buildings, and transforms them into artworks that are complex, but also serene and in the state of constant flux.  The drawing was the starting point and still is the main part of Neill’s work. Black and white introduced her into the world of art. Surroundings are transformed onto the paper and canvases as the viewers clearly feel all of the artist’s past experiences and sense the never-ending passing of time. The most important things for an artist are to have a lot of curiosity and to find a vision, no matter how much time it takes. Paper, linen, and canvas serve as a surface for Neill as she applies various mediums, such as colored pencil, charcoal, paint, and graphite. The whole process relies on intuition and is embedded in the artist’s personal experience, which is sublimated and appears through drawing and painting. She simply let the forms arrive.   Margaret Neill received her BA from Hiram College, Hiram, OH, in 1978, and her MFA in Painting from Brooklyn College, New York, in 1984. She relies on instinct when creating art. It was the long rides in Ohio while she was a child, observing contours of the car and watching landscapes as they turn into something blurry that first gave Neill the idea that she could be an artist. Since then, art has become the best way to communicate with people around her. Also, it is a perfect way to really know yourself, to understand all the feelings and thoughts. Her artworks are included in many prestigious collections: Yale University Art Gallery, Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, The New York Public Library, and many more, as well in numerous private collections.   Neill relies on instinct and intuition and communicates with those around her in a way that she thinks is the most honest of them all – her art. From the childhood memories to the patterns only observable when a viewer reaches a certain age, her artworks are a summarization of her personal experiences that reach sublimation through the processes of painting, and especially drawing. Neill’s art dances on the delicate line that separates the ‘detective’ that carefully investigates forms of her surroundings and the artist with primal urges to express herself through the best means possible, combining the two to create amazing artworks. She is represented by IdeelArt gallery in London, UK.  ",257
Gina Soden,"No matter how much someplace is important for humans, the possibility of us abandoning it is ever-present. We seek a better life, we escape from the danger, we die, we simply leave sometimes. That abandonment is crucial for the work of Gina Soden, who’s made a name for herself by seeking and revealing the beauty in the structures and locations that have lost it, or the others, which never possessed it in the first place. The mutual thing connecting them is the fact they are abandoned, left to the mercy of time and the inevitable decay. Neglect and nostalgia are also present as main motifs, telling the story of both the future and the past in every single photograph taken.   Her style can be characterized as the urban exploration photography, also known as ruins porn. This has become a thing in the recent years, but only a few artists manage to capture the spirit of the ruins as Soden. The process includes countless hours of online researching or walking in the nature just to find an abandoned location worth photographing. Churches, hospitals, asylums, coal mines, all of them are hunted down by the artist. Often the access to these places is forbidden, or they are monitored, and that is complicating her work. Some of Gina’s stunts include bribing the guard of the castle while the owner was sleeping in the house next door, or sneaking into an asylum and spending several hours before finally getting sniffed by a guard dog, being caught and thrown out. Each location has its own architectural character, and the artist is heightening it by showing the slow and painful transformation into oblivion. She hints a narrative with studied composition, giving the scenes a sense of life, rather than simply taking a documentary approach. Soden manages to emphasize that ruinous beauty, balancing between nostalgia and decay. In the same photograph, she is showing the clues of the place it once was, but also what will happen in the future. By combining the past with future, she speaks of the birth and death, completing the circle of life.   Soden studied Photography and Multimedia at the Thames Valley University in London, graduating in 2007. Adventurous spirit as she is, nothing seems to stop her when she finds her ‘target’. She was able to crawl through tunnels to avoid guards, admitting she felt like she was in Shawshank Redemption. Gina’s traveled across the Europe searching for the places of perfect decay, and she hopes she will soon travel around the world, enriching her artistic portfolio. She has exhibited throughout the UK, as part of group shows, or as a solo artist. In the spring of 2010 Soden was awarded photograph of the year by the Royal Windsor Photographic Society, and in 2013, she was awarded Emerging Artist of the Year in The National Open Art Competition. Her work was acquired by the Groucho Club, which also possesses the artworks of Gavin Turk, Damien Hirst, Michael Landy, just to name a few.    If you’re an explorer, then there is no place for fear. Walk bravely, discover what you can and show it to the world. Gina Soden sends a strong message through her work. Even the places like hospital, army bases, factories, all of them important for the human kind, get abandoned. No matter the importance, everything is susceptible to the almighty time. Everything ages, decays, and disappears in the end. A trace of symbolism is present, and even there is no human presence in her photographs, the viewers can’t escape the impression that we all have our beginning, our journey through the life, and our end. She is represented by Artistics, an online art gallery based in Paris.  ",258
Ferle,"Imagine the small woman on the ladders who is trying to hang on the wall her two times bigger than she art piece. Ferle is a French painter who creates surprisingly monumental, non-figurative, but at the same time, not informal art. Her paintings remind of the big piece of fabric, taking the shape of cope, with repeating patterns with the shade of rust. She uses four big sheets of paper stuck together, laid on the floor, onto which she projects ink with the brush. Her colors are black, gray and red and tones vary in a range of primitive cave art, inspired by the Lascaux caves, where the rocks play with the form.  Ferle’s paintings convey the impression of spirituality. For her, art is a moment which captures the motion of the artist, physically and emotionally involved with the creation. Faced with these monumental paintings, the viewer is subconsciously looking for a similarity. Red lines maybe represent sunset sky, and the blue one could be the horizon. But at the end, black color makes a so strong impression, taking away one’s mind into the very depths of the canvases. Ferle creates new spaces, she is opening the door of infinity. Her large canvases are similar to the black hole, depicting unlimited universe.   Ferle has exhibited mostly in Paris and her monumental work is very distinctive and personal in its essence. Her canvases reveal the new world behind, the fourth dimension which draws in the observer. Harmony behind her silent paintings may appear in contrast to the gestural violence that is implemented in her process of creating. Placing the paper on the floor, engaging herself entirely, Ferle translates the energy on the surface.   There’s no doubt that Ferle through her work shares the spirituality, placing the purpose in terms of metaphysics. She understands the painting as any other process in a life, like breathing, or walking. She makes the art pieces because she can’t resist. There’s nothing rational in artistic expression. Her action painting is a driving force of her imagination. Ferle’s art is deep and profound, impressive and special in so many ways. She is not the artist who likes to talk about her work, and that is totally fine because her paintings are telling everything that should be told. Ferle is represented by Artistics Gallery and Z Gallery Arts.  ",259
Xanda McCagg,"Figuration is a style known for being able to capture the form of its subjects. And yet, what often lacks from the works is the very essence of those subjects. Xanda McCagg is an American classically trained painter, who once painted influenced and inspired by the figurative. However, upon finding herself in search of evoking the essence of humans, she abandoned that style and turned to abstraction. Given a closer look, her paintings give hints and show traces of her traditional figurative training from 30 years ago. McCagg’s decision to paint expressionistically came after years of classical study, and this shift came not from a flat-out rejection of those modes of working but rather from a “strong curiosity” to push herself further and to explore the full potential of the medium. In the abstract, she found a way to break free from the strict techniques that, while invaluable to a deeper understanding of the origins of painting, limited her ability to fully realize her vision.  She works in oil, graphite, and collage on canvas and paper. As mentioned above, despite beginning as a figurative painter, she abandoned the figure in searching for more intimacy in portraying what she considers as the essence of humans. Nonetheless, her work remains well informed and influenced by formal elements such as space, which provide an underlying vocabulary for her compositions. The focus on composition is evident when she works in a square format. For instance, in the painting Tear (2015), as soon as she made the red mark across the canvass, she was forced to suddenly rethink the space - creating a new space that she had not been working with. This spontaneity and response to each new mark is at the core of her working process and reflects her ideas about the interaction between people. In Blue White Line (2014), McCagg simplified the composition by playing with layering to create a space that invites the viewer to continue making their own connections and articulations. The experience then goes beyond the painting.    Aside from acquiring more intimate portrayals of human essence, what drawn McCagg to abstraction was its endless freedom. Each person can move from what is presented to other ideas or references within the individuals’ feelings at the moment or deeper within one’s life experience. The exploration of the small and large ways relations can ‘shift’ is integral to her process. She articulates these subtle evolutions through the expressive layering of thin and impasto color, and delicate and rough-hewn lines. Rather than planning precisely where her composition will lead her, she intuits throughout her process the minimum amount needed to manifest the essence of what she calls “the fine line between perception and imagination of these relationships.” McCagg finds inspiration in human experience, in particular the behaviors that arise from, and correlate to relationships between people. Larger systems usually emerge out of those relationships and often serve as an inspiration on some other level. In her own words: “As an artist, I am observing and commenting on the human condition on both a global and an intimate level.” Cultural issues like poverty, government, religion and war, cultural phenomena like mythology, and dichotomies such as strength and weakness often manifest in her work on an intimate scale.   The painter attended Boston University, where she earned her BFA in 1986. She has also studied at the New York Studio School and the Haystack Mountain School in Deer Isle, ME, and taught at the New School in New York and at the Bronx Museum. Aside from artistic endeavors, McCagg is quite busy with her Art Introductions – an institution that offers things like gallery tours with a social twist. It is ideal for those who are seeking a new and dynamic social venue with a cultural spin. Also, McCagg’s skills as an artist were amplified to the extent when she created this alluring social activity designed to introduce people to the arts.  She is represented by IdeelArt.  ",260
Susan Morris,"The British artist Susan Morris examines modern technology, the recording of time, and the documentation of movement. Initially working with photography and video, she now creates automatic drawing or casting – generated by digital recoding processes and output in various media including tapestry, inkjet and more recently 3D printing. Morris holds BA from Birmingham College of Art (now UCE), MA from Goldsmiths College, University of London and PhD, from University of the Arts, London. Her PhD explored the relation between the operation of photography and that of remembrance – drawing on ideas from Barthes, Proust and Lacan. She exhibited in a range of venues, including Bartha Contemporary, London, Kunstraum Alexander Bürkle, Germany, Palazzo Fortuny, Venice, CEAAC, Strasbourg, France, ERES-Stiftung Munich, Germany, Valentines, Los Angeles, USA, Drawing Room London, CentrePasquArt, Biel, Switzerland, and Scheublein + Bak, Zürich, Switzerland. Morris uses digital tracking devices worn on the body to record her daily routine or seemingly repetitive gestures, producing images that reveal a body caught up in the machinations of clock and calendrical time. Using a range of different media, she examines a very traditional idea of an artist's self-portraiture serving as a commentary on subjectivity in general. ",261

Marija Nikolic,"Marija Nikolic is an emerging Serbian artist whose current visual expression is deeply rooted in the aesthetic thought of abstract minimalism and postminimalism. She explores the possibilities of a framed and clear geometric form, creating artworks on paper and canvas. The starting point of her work, which revolves around the exploration of perfect proportions, values, shapes, and color harmony, is a minimalistic approach and reexamination of the form of painting. “Line as a clash of two surfaces is the base building element and as such is present on the majority of artworks.” Nikolic distinguishes her pieces through simplification, geometrization, and reduces everything unnecessary, hoping to achieve aesthetic harmony. She attended the jewelry department of art school Tehnoart Beograd, where she graduated in 2009. Following her graduation, Nikolic enrolled at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Belgrade, completing her Bachelor’s degree in 2013 and her Master’s degree (both in painting) in 2015. That year she had her first solo show (out of four so far), Money and Decay. Held at the Dušan Starčević Memorial Gallery, the exhibition dealt with the topic and symbolism of bonds, coinage, and money as a general concept. A member of the Association of Fine Artists of Serbia since 2020, Marija Nikolic lives and works in Belgrade.     ",263

Cristina Ghetti,"Argentinian-born and Spain-based, Cristina Ghetti is a contemporary abstract painter who explores the intersection of perception and reality by using the visual languages of Op Art, Geometric Abstraction, and Kinetic Art. Quite interested in cross-disciplinary methods and tools, her works are born on the computer screen, where she uses various digital tools, creating images that trick the mind into perceiving things like movement and depth on a two-dimensional, static plane. The next stage is translating the digitally created image onto canvas using acrylic paint. Ghetti earned her Master of Visual Arts and Multimedia at the Polytechnic University in Valencia, Spain. Her profound interest and research into the development of new geometries in visual arts have culminated in her doctoral thesis “Post Medial Geometry.” She lives and works in Valencia.

Ginnie Gardiner,"Ginnie Gardiner is an American contemporary artist widely known for her painting and collages, where collages, while independent artworks on their own, also serve as studies for her paintings. Speaking of the paintings, in all of them the artist has sought color mastery and color is the subject of her work. In 1974, Gardiner graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and from 1978 she and her husband lived in a Chelsea loft in New York City. They moved upstate to Catskill, New York in 2005, where they purchased, renovated and restored the Lyceum, a historic Federal building located in the Village of Catskill.   ",267
Nora Moreno-Garcia,"Nora Moreno-García is a Colombian-American artist whose paintings reflect on those happenings of life which cannot be understood nor expressed. Having realized there is a limit in the understanding and poverty in the language, she chose an art career. As a painter, she attempts to translate and transform those unnameable and unspeakable moments of life that marvel her and cannot be told in words into metaphorical and visual images. Expressing herself with a brush rather than voice, Moreno-García’s aesthetic experiences have taught her there is a deeper level of knowledge and an inner way of seeing things that defies logic and reason.

Richard Prince,"Richard Prince, a controversial American painter and photographer, is best known for his tongue-in-cheek appropriation works containing rephotographed and cropped popular advertisements. Prince’s initial goal was to emphasize the powerful impact of mass media imagery in shaping contemporary consumer culture, but eventually, he ended up creating his very own pop style and powerful series of works which became some of the most wanted materials at many prestigious auctions. An avid collector of art, books, manuscripts, and various odd objects, Prince has gained the reputation of the chronicler of his generation. I don’t see any difference now between what I collect and what I make. It’s become the same. What I’m collecting will, a lot of times, end up in my work, said Prince on his collecting processes.  Richard Prince was born in the late 40s in the Panama Canal Zone, which is nowadays a part of the Republic of Panama. Ever since his early childhood Prince has moved lots – from the Panama Canal he moved all the way up, to a suburb of Boston. When it comes to his education, he attended Nasson College in Maine, but he describes his school in a rather vague way as if it was without any real structure. Eventually, Prince has moved from Maine to New York City, in order to join a publishing company called Time Inc. His job at Time Inc. was to supply the company with various tear sheets of articles for magazines. Around the time he started working for this company, Prince started to show more and more interest for visual arts and particularly painting. He felt drawn to the work of the eminent abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock. I was very attracted to the idea of someone who was fairly antisocial, kind of a loner, said Prince on Pollock’s personality.   Over time, Prince has developed his artistic style based on the use appropriated imagery – particularly humorous cartoons and mismatched jokes. He copied such imagery onto large-scale, monochrome canvases. These works evolved to eventually include text-based elements that he manipulated in a painterly manner. Prince has worked in a variety of media, including drawing, painting, sculpture, installation, film, video, and photography, but he is also a writer of poetry and fiction. Some of his most famous artworks are his Nurse Paintings, inspired by pulp romance novels. One of these paintings was featured on Sonic Youth's album Sonic Nurse and it influenced even the world of fashion, namely Marc Jacobs’s Spring 2008 collection for Louis Vuitton. Prince’s rephotography uses appropriation as its own goal - the artist simply needed the works of others in order to choose a departure point for his own art. In fact, the appropriation wasn’t anything entirely new or shocking around the time Prince started using it. It was already popularized practice thanks to the great artists such as Cindy Sherman and Barbara Kruger. Prince had very little practical experience when it comes to photography and he wasn’t overly interested in any technical details. He said in a couple of interviews that he just needed a subject to depict and the choice of medium would naturally come up.   It is not surprising that Prince had to face a lawsuit at some point, having in mind the blurred lines between appropriation and stealing. In 2008, photographer Patrick Cariou decided to file a lawsuit against Prince and Gagosian Gallery for copyright infringement issues related to the Canal Zone exhibit at the Gagosian gallery. Prince has appropriated 35 photographs of Cariou and he barely changed anything in them. Furthermore, he made 28 paintings based on the images of Rastafarians from Cariou’s Yes Rasta book. In 2011, US district ruled against Prince and Gagosian Gallery. However, in 2013, the US Court of Appeals managed to reverse the previous ruling and prove that Prince's used Cariou’s photographs in a transformative way, hence the use was deemed fair. Five of Prince’s works, which were obviously less transformative, were sent back for further review. In 2014, Cariou and Prince have finally announced that they had settled this case.   Prince's legendary series known as Cowboys was initially created from 1980 to 1992 and it is the artist’s best-known group of rephotographs. These pieces are based on the Marlboro cigarette advertisements and the Marlboro Man, who was the symbol of American masculinity. The Cowboys portray men in typical American outfits, such as boots and hats, together with horses, and lassos. The imagery is set in the Western part of the United States, known for its arid and stony landscapes with desert flora, such as cacti and tumbleweeds. The Marlboro advertisements were perfectly executed, with an extreme attention to detail, which was one of the reasons Prince was impressed by them. His other photo series from the same period, called Gangs and Girlfriends, are quite similar to Cowboys when it comes to their aesthetics. Prince used images from various motorcycle magazines and he was particularly fond of motorcyclists' girlfriends, seductively posing on their boyfriends' bikes. In June 1980, around the time Prince published his Cowboys, he also had his first solo exhibition. It took place at the CEPA gallery in Buffalo, New York, and Prince’s book called Menthol Pictures was published as a part of his residency at the CEPA gallery. Just a year later, Prince had his first West Coast solo exhibition at Jancar/Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles, while in 1985, he spent four months in Venice, Los Angeles, where he dedicated himself to a couple of new projects.   Prince's Jokes come in a few different forms. His first Jokes were quite simple pieces, hand written, taken from various joke books. However, these initial jokes became more complex, substantial artworks once the artist started to combine them with suitable imagery. In fact, his main goal was to pair jokes with pictures that had no visible connection and in such way create obscure and peculiar relations. In the 80s and 90s, this particular style of combining short sentences and imagery was becoming increasingly popular and Barbara Kruger was the most famous artists who used this style. When it comes to Prince's jokes, they are mainly satirical one-liners, commenting on the topics such as religion, the marital relationships as well as his own experiences with women.   The Nurse Paintings is another Prince’s series that has reached an international fame and glory. These pieces are inspired by the covers of inexpensive novels called pulp romance novels. These novels were usually sold at newspaper stands and they were ridiculed for their tacky, overly sentimental plots, aimed at housewives. Prince came to a brilliant idea to scan the covers of these novels and then use inkjet printing to transfer the pictures to canvas. After the process was completed, he would stylize the pieces with acrylic paints. These artworks debuted in 2003, at Barbara Gladstone Gallery in New York. Initially, these pieces have received mixed responses, but his Overseas Nurse from 2002 became a record-breaker when it got sold for $8,452,000 at Sotheby's in London. Titles of Prince’s pieces from this series include Surfer Nurse, Naughty Nurse, Millionaire Nurse, Dude Ranch Nurse and so forth. Inspired by Prince’s work, one of Sonic Youth’s albums has a Nurse Painting for its cover. The nurses all wear typical caps and their mouths are covered by simple surgical masks. The final images preserve the original title of the novel and the picture of a woman from the book cover, while everything else is obscured or transformed into a neutral background. It is important to mention that Richard Prince used the technique of modern rephotography and he also showed his capability to combine digital and analog media. The application of an analog medium, which is acrylic, to a digitized print, which is ink jet, forms a unique bridge between traditional and modern artistic processes.   Prince's later paintings produced around 2007 belong to more traditional styles of figurative art. They represent a clear departure from the kitschy appearance of his earlier poster alike creations. Prince’s newest pieces, from 2013 to 2015, are pornographic ink-jet prints overlaid with acrylic paint in a particular style that is close to the work of Willem de Kooning. In these new pieces, Prince experiments with the distortion of human faces, hands and feet. Contrary to the obvious linguistic context of the Jokes, these new works represent a purely visual message. When it comes to Prince’s history of exhibitions, it is quite long and successful. Talking about his major shows held after 2000, a grand retrospective called Richard Prince: Spiritual America was mounted in 2007 by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. The artist is still very active exhibitor - in 2015 and 2014 he had ten solo shows held in New York, France, the UK, and Japan.   Making art has never been a mystery to me. It's never been something that's very difficult, claims Prince. Even though his words might seem ironic to some, based on the fact that majority of his work is based on appropriation, it still goes without saying that Richard Price has managed to redefine the concepts of ownership and authorship through his bold and provocative art. The artist’s turbulent yet incredibly prolific career is also a perfect confirmation of Picasso’s idea that good artists borrow, but great artists steal. The artist is represented by Gagosian Park & 75th New York, Gagosian West 24th, Gagosian Beverly Hills, Gagosian Brittania Street and Gagosian West 21st.  ",270
LeRoy Neiman,"LeRoy Neiman, born Leroy Leslie Runquist, was an American artist of Swedish descent, best known for his brilliantly colored, expressionist paintings and screen prints of athletes, musicians, and sports. LeRoy Neiman was one of the most popular living artists in the United States before he passed away in June 2012. Millions of people have watched him create his art during the live coverage of the Olympics and Superbowl, as well as other major American and worldwide competitions. LeRoy Neiman had the journalistic talent along with an enviable artistic ability to convey the essence of games.  LeRoy Neiman was born on June 8, 1921 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He was educated at a Catholic primary school in Saint Paul, where constantly drew, entered art contests in his home country, and produced posters for school happenings. Leroy Neiman studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and also taught there for 10 years. When war raged in 1942, Neiman dropped out of school and enlisted in the Army. Neiman put his talents to use by painting murals in mess halls. His works compared enlisted men to officers, and this interest in social structure was an inspiration for many future works. Neiman's professional influences include a variety of Impressionists, Fauvists, and Expressionists. The influence of Jackson Pollock is obvious, due to Neiman's use of the action painting style. His first painting using this technique was Idle Boats, which was purchased by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. However, it wasn’t until his mid-career that Neiman has finished the search for his very own, recognizable style of serigraph edition. The majority of his most prominent hand signed, paper based paintings focus on sport, such as basketball, boxing, billiards, hockey, gymnastics, shot put, swimming, and even cycling.  No matter the subject, ever LeRoy Neiman's piece has the hand signed signature in the form of the bloody color red.    Collaboration with Playboy and Hugh Hefner is one of the most important milestones in Leroy Neiman’s career. While he was a young artist who was freelancing at a Chicago department store, Neiman met Hugh Hefner, who was then a copywriter there. A few after their initial meeting, Neiman showed Hefner some of his paintings. Hefner was very surprised, even impressed, and he decided to contact Art Paul, Playboy’s art director, regarding LeRoy Neiman’s pieces. Paul immediately commissioned Neiman to illustrate Black Country, which was a short story about a life of a jazz musician. Neiman’s creation of those illustrations earned Playboy some prestigious awards and he gladly kept collaborating with the famous magazine. In 1958, LeRoy Neiman started making sketches and he decided to search for ideas for another notable Playboy feature, entitled Man at His Leisure. On this occasion, Neiman also wrote the text for the feature. Neiman’s work kept appearing in Playboy for the next 15 years and the artist started traveling a lot thanks to various Playboy commissions. For instance, in 1960, LeRoy Neiman captured many sport scenes and competitions in England, such as the Grand National Steeplechase, Epsom Derby, Ascot and also the Tour d’Argent, Maxim’s, the Lido, and the Folies-Bergere in France. He visited the Cannes Film Festival and St. Tropez too, along with the highly authentic Fiesta de San Isidro bullfights. Neiman never missed any of Monaco  gatherings as well, such as the Grand Prix auto race. The variety of subjects that LeRoy Neiman depicted for Playboy in his later years don’t include only happenings, but also portraiture, such as include the Beatles and the Carnaby Street scene in London. Neiman portrayed Prince Philip playing polo at Windsor Castle, controversial nudists relaxing on the Adriatic Coast of Croatia, America’s Cup challenges and even Bolshoi ballet dancers in Russia. Between 1960 and 1970, LeRoy Neiman has produced more than 100 canvas-based works and two murals for Playboy. This magazine made the good life a reality for me and made it the subject matter of my work – not affluence and luxury, as such, but joie de vivre itself, LeRoy Neiman said about the nature of his vibrant and ever-changing pieces.   In 1961, LeRoy Neiman rented a studio in Paris, which became his temporary home and artistic sanctuary. While living in France, Neiman has studied the Deauville social season and he won one of his earliest awards - a gold medal at the Salon d’Art Moderne, in Paris. After spending some time in France, Neiman decided to move to Italy for a while, where he painted a regatta of gondoliers in Venice and made friends with the legendary filmmaker Federico Fellini. Neiman’s first solo exhibitions outside the United States were held in galleries in London and Paris in 1962. After returning to the United States in 1963, Neiman has established his own studio in New York City. During the same year, Leeroy Neiman had his first solo exhibit in New York, at the Hammer Galleries, where he showcased his entire oeuvre. After this initial success, more than 50 additional venues in the United States have hosted Neiman's exhibitions - Minnesota Museum of Art, the University of Texas in El Paso, the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and the Museo de Bellas Artes, in Venezuela.   In 1972, thousands of curious people worldwide watched LeRoy Neiman sketching Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer at the legendary champion chess tournament in Iceland.[3] Later on, Neiman started sketching various exciting duels and scenes at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. For the creation of Olympics sketches, Neiman used an amazing combination of rather versatile materials. He combined watercolor, ink, gouache, felt-tip marker, chalk, colored pencil, graphite, and charcoal.[1] The artist has shown his remarkable skills at portraiture and stop-motion drawing many times during the next decade – Neiman visited the Olympic Games in Montreal in 1976, Lake Placid in 1980, Sarajevo and Los Angeles in 1984. In 1978 and 1979 at Super Bowl, he changed his regular techniques and started using a computerized electronic pen to sketch the live action for CBS-TV. LeRoy Neiman was the official artist for the Sports Spectaculars broadcast in 1979 and 1980, and also for the 1986 Goodwill Games, which were held in Moscow and supported by the Turner Broadcasting Network.   Some of LeRoy Neiman's most successful early exhibits were the Chicago Art Exhibition and Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery of Art's American 25th Biennial Exhibition. Neiman was commissioned to produce illustrations and other artwork for Playboy Magazine, his most famous series being Man at His Leisure. Neiman traveled the world, painting the best in entertainment industry, from English steeplechases to the Cannes Film Festival. Neiman also worked at studios in France and Italy. When Neiman returned to the United States, his first solo gallery exhibition was held at New York's Hammer Galleries. He has covered five Olympiads, holds four honorary degrees, and wrote nine books, including Horses and Winners. In 1995, Neiman endowed Columbia University with the funds to create the LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies. Also, it is well-known that hundreds of works by Neiman appeared in his nine books - Horses from 1979, LeRoy Neiman Posters from 1980, Carnaval from 1981 and Winners from 1983, which was one of his most popular works which got published even in Japanese in 1985.[2] The rest of his works were entitled Monte Carlo Chase, Big Time Gol, LeRoy Neiman, An American in Paris and LeRoy Neiman On Safari. Each year until his death, LeRoy used to create around eight limited-edition serigraph and silkscreen works, which were usually distributed by Knoedler Publishing. All of Neiman's works were sold in many galleries throughout the United States and Europe and around 150,000 of Neiman prints have been purchased to date.   The prominent Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in Russia has bought 19 of Leroy Neiman’s works in 1973, which are still in their permanent collections. Despite such great recognition and success, art critics have often totally ignored LeRoy Neiman’s, labeling it as superficial or vulgar. Yet, many of his colorful images of the so-called good life have appeared in the form of beautiful etchings, lithographs, silkscreen and even sculptures in the most important permanent collections of public and private museums, galleries and similar art institutions worldwide. These institutional acquisitions, more than anything else, speak of the great value and enormous appeal of LeRoy Neiman’s art. Whether one approves of LeRoy Neiman’s view or not, one must agree that he is a work of art himself, because of his constant efforts to depict entertainment industry and sport in the most enticing ways. Exactly this constant effort is what signed LeRoy Neiman's place in the history of art and sport alike.  LeRoy Neiman lived and worked in New York City.

Richard Anuszkiewicz,"An American painter, printmaker, and sculptor, Richard Anuszkiewicz was an abstract artist best known for his mesmerizing Op Art works. A student of Josef Albers, Anuszkiewicz explored the phenomena of light, color, and line and their effects on human perception. After training at the Cleveland Institute of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, the artist continued his education with Josef Albers at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned his Masters of Fine Arts. One of the founders and foremost exponents of Op Art, he focused on the capacity of the eye to ""mix"" complementary colors presented separately on the canvas. Anuszkiewicz's works are characterized by the subtle chemistry of complementary colors, creating the illusion of oscillating movement through contrasting color relationships. The geometric shapes he uses seem to pop and pulsate off of the canvas, revealing the malleability of our perceptions of stillness and movement, depth and color. These vibrant abstractions also reveal the artist's awareness of line as a compositional tool of surprising versatility. Varying in thickness, length, and spacing, these lines create the impression of different planes. ",272
Larry Rivers,"American artist Larry Rivers is known as the grandfather of Pop art. He was an accomplished painter, sculptor, actor, Jazz musician, filmmaker, poet, teacher, and poet, thus earning the title “a renaissance man”. An established figure in the New York scene, his work is often compared to that of artists Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. With a career spanning over 50 years, it is hard to define Rivers' artistic expression, for he constantly experimented with different mediums and styles, often merging the narrative elements with abstract. Andy Warhol said about Rivers:   Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg, born in 1923 in the Bronx to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, changed his name to Larry Rivers when he was 17. The artist firstly attended the Juilliard School of Music, where he studied with such legends as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, with whom he became close friends. Rivers was an accomplished saxophone player and spent several years playing jazz in clubs.  After WWII, he began painting, and he enrolled in Hans Hofmann’s School of painting and later graduated from New York University. The artist received both positive and negative critics for his use of artworks of renowned masters in his work, such as Olympia, by Édouard Manet, or the paintings by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Rembrandt van Rijn, and Paul Cézanne.   Rivers' work can not be defined as purely Pop Art. On one hand, he constantly incorporated found objects, mass media items, unusual materials. However, he never abandoned figuration, like, for example, the paintings O'Hara Nude with Boots (1954) and the Vocabulary Lesson (Polish) (1964). In the 70s, the artist used several techniques, including printmaking, stencils, and airbrush. The compositions of his paintings were influenced by the rhythm of jazz music. The artist was often a guest at Andy Warhol’s factory and the Chelsea Hotel. Rivers’ work constantly shifted between Nouveau Réalisme and Abstract Expressionism, which contributed to the change of American Modernist painting and paved the way for Pop Art.   It was not just the artist's revolutionary work that influenced Pop, but also his hedonistic lifestyle that often bordered on inappropriate. The public persona Rives presented to the world enjoyed the exhibitionistic lifestyle and had a strong desire to shock. By provoking, he would raise questions about the place and value of the culture and art and shake the artistic establishment. Some of his artworks are considered too controversial for showcasing even today, such as the film Growing, which follows the adolescent maturity of his two daughters filmed naked. The artist's work was exhibited in several retrospectives, including exhibitions at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C, Kunsthalle in Munich, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, and the Staatliche Kunsthalle in Berlin. Larry Rivers passed away in 2002, New York. ",273
Nicholas Krushenick,"Nicholas Krushenick was a New York painter, one of the forerunners of the pop art movement. He began showing his work publicly in New York in 1957, at the age of 28. By 1962, Krushenick's work was shown at upscale galleries and, by the year 2000, was part of major permanent collections throughout New York and the United States.",274

Jessica Snow,"Jessica Snow is an American artist, best known for her abstract and hard edged work characterized by bright and vivid linear forms.  Jessica was born in Berkeley, California. She earned BA at The University of California, Davis, and received her MFA from Mills College. Jessica also attended the Université de la Nouvelle-Sorbonne III and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in New York. Among her professors and mentors were famous Hung Liu and Wayne Thiebaud.  Snow once said that painting could be conceived as a structural diagram of the human psyche. But, what really inspires this artist is the randomness of the stream of consciousness - so, she is sincerely content when her paintings are ‘human’ in their lack of perfection. Snow’s work also explores that gray aria between order and chaos, between logic and emotion.  Jessica’s work is mostly done in acrylic and oil. Sometimes, she even draws on the surface with a black fine-point pen and always makes studies with a pen or pencil before she starts to paint – sometimes creating up to 20 sketches! Though these sketches she addresses problems such as spatial issue, for example.   When talking about her art favorites, Snow always mentions  Sophie Taeuber-Arp and especially Matisse, Sol LeWitt’s and Ellsworth Kelly’s work. She received Artadia Award, the Cadogan Fellowship Award and was in a selection for the American Artists Abroad Program in Montevideo.  The artist is represented by IdeelArt.

Michael Joo,"The artistic practice of Michael Joo is based on a rather conceptual approach conceived in regard to scientific methodology and research. Since the early 1990s, when he emerged on the art scene, this artist has been creating a multimedia body of work that he believes to be the documentation of a certain process. By moving frequently from disciplines such as entropy, ontology, and epistemology, and experimenting with different techniques, Joo continually blurs the boundaries between art and science while exploring cultural heritage, natural history, and identity. Michael Joo received his MFA from the Yale School of Art, Yale University, New Haven, in 1991, after graduating with a BFA from Washington University, St Louis, 1989. His works are held in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, just to mention a few. Michael Joo currently lives and works in New York, NY. ",277
Tinker Brothers,"The Tinker Brothers (Noah and Liam) are contemporary Pop artists currently based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. In 2011, the duo dropped out of their respective studies at the University of Applied Sciences and the University of Technology. A higher calling in 2012, saw the brothers quit their jobs, get rid of all their ‘stuff’ (minus some essentials) and follow their dreams.  They spent the next five years experimenting with different media and techniques taking steps towards realizing their dream of one day becoming some of the most influential artists of our time. With simplicity in mind, they ultimately discovered their signature style of bold stenciled words and classic cartoons in black and white. The artists are represented by Addicted Art Gallery. ",278

Pia Fries,"A contemporary Swiss artist, Pia Fries is one of the foremost representatives of European abstract painting. She uses photographed and silkscreened elements in her work alongside and under and against fantastic piles of caked, troweled, scraped and smeared oil paint. Born in Beromünster, Switzerland, Fries currently lives and works in Düsseldorf and Munich. She studied sculpture in Lucerne in 1980, and painting under Gerhard Richter at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1986. As the artist explained herself, she learned from Richter not any specific theory of painting but the belief that painting was something that “you can do today.” She has exhibited her work in venues such as Kunstmuseum Luzern, Luzern, Museum Kurhaus Kleve, Kleve, Overbeck-Gesellschaft, Lübeck, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY, Josef Albers Museum Quadrat, Bottrop and Galeria Filomena Soares, Lisbon. Her work is in numerous collections, such as Aagauer Kunsthaus, Aarau, Switzerland, Binding Stiftung, Basel, Switzerland, Kunstmuseum Luzern, Switzerland and Neues Museum, Nuremberg, Germany. Her paintings are characterized by extroverted passages of paint that nearly always surface and submerge from areas of flat white ground. In he process, she uses palette knives, squeegees and extruding tools that she makes herself, loading paint in massive quantities onto snowy white panels. Pia Fries lives and works in Düsseldorf, Germany.",280
Roy Lichtenstein,"Inspired by consumerism and a culture of mass production, the famous Pop Art movement shook the globe and left a deep mark in the 20th-century art. It started in the middle of 1950’s in the United Kingdom and spilled over to the United States changing the direction of art. One of the first American Pop artists who achieved widespread renown was Roy Lichtenstein. The painter, sculptor, and printmaker, Lichtenstein is considered, alongside Andy Warhol, one of the most famous artist of the new bold genre which primarily goal was to bring art closer to the general public and to question the boundaries between fine art and popular culture. His paintings based on comic strips, and its use of parody, became synonymous with Pop Art and also provoked many debates over ideas of originality and consumerism.   Roy Fox Lichtenstein was born in 1927 in Manhattan, one of the five boroughs of New York City. He was part of an upper-class Jewish family, his father, Milton Lichtenstein was a real estate broker, and his mother, Beatrice Lichtenstein, was a homemaker, as well as a gifted piano player. The artist was raised on the Upper West Side, owing to his affluent background. He attended Reginald Marsh’s painting class at the Art Students League in 1941, where he learned to paint directly from the model but was ultimately dissatisfied with the classes’ insistence on technique above process. Encouraged by his parents he enrolled at Ohio State University to study art. During World War II he was drafted into the army, serving for three years before returning to school in 1946. Three years later he earned an MFA and continued to teach and to paint in Ohio for several years.    In the early 1940’s, before employing the Pop Art style we remember him for most, Lichtenstein experimented in expressionistic and abstract painting. Influenced by Reginald Marsh, the artist explored the mythology, American History, and folklore, paying homage to the old masters. His early 1950s works, painted in a European Modernist style, often show originally “American” subject matters such as scenes of western expansion. In the late 1940s, Lichtenstein participated in shows at galleries throughout the USA including Chinese Gallery and Ten-Thirty Gallery. His first solo show was held at Carlebach Gallery in Manhattan in 1951. In 1957, he moved back to upstate New York where he began teaching at the State University of New York at Oswego in 1958. Lichtenstein adopted a series of different artistic languages, first approximating Picasso’s style of the 1940s, in 1956 turning to a more ornamental idiom and then to Rococo motifs, and finally turning to abstraction in 1958 in a late variation of Action painting. Though his early works were not successful, Lichtenstein decided to provoke the art world a little and started to incorporate hidden images of popular comic figures such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck into his abstract works.    In 1960, Roy Lichtenstein moved to New Jersey where he accepted a position as assistant professor of art at Douglass College, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey. It was at the same time that he began his first pop paintings using cartoon images and techniques derived from the appearance of commercial printing. In 1961, he made his first painting without any expressionism titled Look Mickey, based on an image he finds in one of his children’s Little Golden Book series. Look Mickey is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value as well as being the first example of the artist's employment of speech balloons, comic imagery and Ben-Day dots - a system used in mass-circulation printed sources such as comics, newspapers, and billboards - as a source for a painting. The work is regarded by art critics as revolutionary both as a progression of Pop Art and as a work of modern art in general. In 1961, Lichenstein met the art dealer Ivan Karp, the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery. The artist showed several paintings to Karp who decided to represent Lichtenstein a few weeks later. A solo exhibition of his art at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1962 garnered him critical acclaim and notoriety in the art world. Some of Lichenstein’s greatest works evolved from imagery drawn from popular culture: advertising images, war-time comics, and pin-up portraits, as well as traditional painting genres such as landscapes, still lifes, and interiors. Mining material from advertisements, comics, and the everyday, the artist brought what was then a great taboo—commercial art—into the gallery space. In his famous 1963 piece Drowning Girl (also known as Secret Hearts or I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink) the artist utilizes the conventions of comic book art - a thought bubble conveys the thoughts of the subject, while Ben-Day dots shows the result of the mechanized printing process. Drowning Girl is one of the most representative pieces of the Pop Art movement and part of the Museum of Modern Art’s collection since 1971.  Lichenstein’s most celebrated image - and one of the best known works of Pop Art - is a 1963 diptych painting Whaam! It adapts a panel by Irv Novick from the Star Jockey story from issue No. 89 of DC Comics' All-American Men of War. Whaam! depicts a fighter aircraft in the left panel firing a rocket into an enemy plane in the right panel, which disintegrates in a vivid red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is emphasized by the use of the onomatopoeic lettering ""WHAAM!"" in the right panel, and a yellow-boxed caption with black lettering at the top of the left panel. Regarded as the temporal, spatial and psychological integration of its two panels, the painting was purchased by the Tate Gallery, London, in 1966.  When Lichtenstein’s oeuvre was first released, the artist was harshly criticized for not creating anything original and drawing solely from the pre-existing artwork. Today, his legacy has risen high above any complaints from his critics, as some of his pieces have sold for millions of dollars. Lichtenstein’s most expensive paintings ever sold - Nurse - was made in 1964. Featuring an alluring woman in uniform whose skin is colored with his signature hand-painted Ben-day dots, the piece was purchased on November 9, 2015, by an anonymous buyer at Christie’s New York for 95.4 million dollars. Previously owned by some of the most famous art collectors, including Leon Kraushar and Karl Ströher, it is the 29th most expensive painting ever sold.   Lichtenstein began experimenting with three-dimensional works in the mid-1960s. Some of his first sculptures were For Head of Girl (1964), and Head with Red Shadow (1965). He created many public works during his lifetime including Brushstrokes in Flight, a 25-foot tall sculpture for display at the Port Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio; Tokyo Brushstroke I and II, Shinjuku I-Land Co, Ltd. Tokyo, Japan; Barcelona Head, Spain Ajuntament de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; and Mermaid, commissioned by Art in Public Places Committee, Inc., at the Miami Beach Theater for the Performing Arts, Miami, FL.  Roy Lichtenstein’s work has been included in numerous individual and collective shows in galleries and museums throughout the world. Most recently, in collaboration with the Roy Lichtenstein foundation Gagosian Gallery in New York presented the recreation or Lichtenstein’s seminal public work entitled Greene Street Mural. Accompanied by Lichtenstein’s paintings and sculptures, the show was on view in September 2015. Some of his solo exhibitions was held at Galleria Civica d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Turin, Italy; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; Tate Modern London, England; Whitney Museum of American Art; The Albertina, Vienna, Austria; The Morgan Library and Museum, New York City; Mitchell-Innes & Nash Gallery, Chelsea, New York City; Museo Triennale, Milan, Italy; Santa Fe Museum of Fine Arts Santa Fe, New Mexico; MAM (Museu de Arte Moderna), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Museum of Contemporary Art, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; and Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark, to name a few. His work was included in group shows at Museum of Modern Art, NY; Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, Texas; Museum Voor Schone Kunsten, Ghent, Belgium; Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, Massachusetts; Galerie Ileana Sonnabend, Paris, France; Galerie Buren, Stockholm, Sweden; Nationalgalerie, Berlin, Germany, among others.   Later in his career, Lichtenstein stopped using comic book sources and extended his source material to art history, including the work of Claude Monet, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger and Salvador Dalí. In the 1980s and '90s, he also painted representations of modern house interiors, brushstrokes and mirror reflections, all in his trademark, cartoon-like style. Still Life paintings, sculptures, and drawings, produced from 1972 to the early 1980s, cover a wide range of motifs and themes, including the most traditional such as fruit, flowers, and vases. In his Reflection series, made between 1988 and 1990, the artist reused his own motifs from earlier pieces. The nude is a recurring element in his art of the 1990s, like in Collage for Nude with Red Shirt (1995). Roy Lichtenstein received many awards including National Medal of the Arts, Washington D.C. (1995); Creative Arts Award in Painting, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts (1991); American Academy in Rome, Rome, Italy. Artist in residence (1989); and Skowhegan Medal for Painting, Skowehegan School, Skowehegan, Maine (1977), as well as many Honorary Doctorates in Fine Art like The George Washington University, Washington D.C; California Institute of Fine Arts, Valencia, California; Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. His work was acquired by major collections around the world including the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., The Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.  By hand-painting the usually machine-generated dots, and recreating comic book scenes, Roy Lichtenstein changed the way we look at our world but didn’t use that to cultivate his celebrity. Instead, he continued to explore and work on projects that he found appealing until his last days. He died of pneumonia on September 29, 1997, at New York University Medical Center, where he had been hospitalized for several weeks. With his unique combination of a technical invention, humor, irony, and recognizable imagery, Lichtenstein moved the line between mass reproduction and high art. He fused popular and mass culture elements from television, advertisements, films, and cartoons, with the techniques of fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the final product. Lichtenstein’s use of populist iconography expanded the definition of art, while his signature Ben-day dots, stripes, and palette of primary colors made an enormous contribution to contemporary art. Almost two decades after his death his influence on the outcome of art has been amazing and overwhelming.  ",281
Sam Francis,"Sam Francis was an American abstract painter who enjoyed exploring creative processes with an unstoppable driving force. He is known as one of the twentieth century’s most successful post-World War II abstract expressionists. He has created thousands of paintings as well as works on paper, prints, monotypes and even sculptures, which brought him a strong, long-lasting international reputation. His pieces can found in major museum collections and institutions worldwide. Francis is considered as one of the best interpreters of color and light and his work holds references not only to abstract expressionism but also to color field painting, French impressionism and Chinese and Japanese painting.  Sam Francis was born in San Mateo in California in the early 20s. As a child, he was initially interested in music and his love for visual arts hasn’t developed until his later years. Generally speaking, Francis was a very curious young man interested not only in visual arts, but also in botany, medicine, and psychology. However, before obtaining his BA and MA degrees in natural sciences, Francis has served in the United States Air Force, but eventually he got injured during test flights. It wasn’t until the 1950s that Francis has graduated from the University of California, Berkeley. After the graduation, he has moved to Paris and quickly earned the reputation of the most promising American painter in Paris. This period was a transformative era of his career. He was exploring the painters of the great masters – for example, he immersed himself deeply in a study of Monet’s Water Lilies. In the next four decades, Francis has traveled lots and maintained a few studios - in Bern, Tokyo, Mexico City and his native California. During his frequent travels, he was exposed to many styles, artistic techniques and cultural influences, which has speeded up his own development. Francis was known to possess a lyrical and gestural abilities which enabled him to capture, in a very personalized way, brilliance, energy and striking power of colors. His paintings underline his love of literature, music, and science and his emotions had a surprisingly wide range. His interest in the creative processes was synergistic – he aimed at addressing not only artistic issues, but also technology, psychology, science, and medicine through his projects. He was a pioneer investor when it comes to non-renewable energy sources and cures for AIDS. Around the end of his life, Francis was suffering from prostate cancer and he couldn’t neither paint nor do any editing with his right hand after an injury. However, using the last bits of energy, he has completed an amazing series of 150 small paintings before he died in Santa Monica. He was buried in Olema, in Marin County of California.   Initially, Francis was influenced by the works of abstract expressionists, such as Mark Rothko, and Clyfford Still. However, his influences got changed later and he became associated with the second generation of abstract expressionists, whose main representatives were Joan Mitchell and Helen Frankenthaler. This second generation was notably interested in the expressive use of color.Between 1950 and 1958, Francis was spending his time between the south of France, Tokyo, Mexico City, Bern, and the United States and he picked up various artistic influences from these cities and countries. His development was mostly affected by his exposure to French modern painting and Zen Buddhism in Japan. His works from the 1950s went through an exciting transformation consisting of several stages. Everything began with monochromatic abstractions and it was followed by lively colored murals and paintings that feature large areas of negative space. After his 1953 painting Big Red was featured in the 1956 exhibition Twelve Artists at MOMA in New York, Francis started to gain an international recognition. He painted large murals for the Kunsthalle in Basel in 1956 and for the Chase Manhattan Bank in 1959. Following this success, in the early 60s, he created a few series of works, including his famous Blue Balls series. These paintings consisting of predominantly round forms and drips and even though the work is entirely abstract, it referenced the pain that artist suffered in 1961 due to his renal tuberculosis. Next stage in his career was Fresh Air series from the early 70s. These pieces were created by adding drips and splatters of color to wet paints applied with a roller. Until 1974, most of Francis' paintings had a formal grid or matrix made up of crossing pieces of color. Some of these grid-works were really large, up to twenty feet long. This matrix structure has gradually disappeared from Francis' work after the 1980s. In addition to dedication to canvas-based works, Francis was also known as a printmaker who made numerous etchings, lithographs, and monotypes. In 1984, he has founded The Lapis Press group, with the objective to make unusual texts in visually appealing formats. This means that the versatile artist was interested even in graphic design and typography.   Francis has also produced a number of sculptures and sculpture drawings. Many of these drawings were made in Japan and inspired by simple classical forms. They combine rings and cones, which rest on squares and rectangular forms or float on the paper, seemingly weightless. These sculpture drawings express a certain degree of dynamics, because of the way how Francis has arranged them on the white paper. In 1966, these works were exhibited in Tokyo at the Minami Gallery and a year later at the San Francisco Museum. The three-dimensional works that Francis started making in Japan actually stayed with him after the sixties as well. In 1979, Francis decided to finally cast some of his drawings, to convert them into three-dimensional works. the sculpture. The geometric forms of his sculptures seem very dynamic and connected to each other. The open spaces he often uses, inspired by the teachings of Zen Buddhism, create a clean energy which is emphasized by the chromed steel and its light-reflecting properties.   Because Francis has worked and exhibited in the United States, Europe, and Asia, he is considered as one of the most prominent international post-war painters. His work was most often exhibited in Europe and Japan. In 1991, he was elected as an Associate Member of the National Academy of Design. During his lifetime, Francis’ work was featured in 113 solo exhibitions in various museums and galleries, with the additional 90 solo exhibits after 1994, when he died.His paintings can be seen in the most eminent international museum collections, such as Metropolitan Museum and MOMA in New York, Kunstmuseum in Basel, Switzerland, Idemitsu Museum of Arts in Tokyo, and the Centre Pompidou. His work is continuously popular and deemed extremely valuable at auctions. For instance, in 2010 his Middle Blue was sold at auction for $6,354,500, which was a record for the artist. Later on, in 2013 his Symphony in Blue was sold at Sotheby's for $1,145,000 and finally, in 2016, his Summer #1, was sold for $11,842,000, which has established a  world record for the artist.   Sam Francis Foundation was founded soon after the artist’s death in 1994. The mission of this foundation is to research, document and protect the creative legacy of the artist and also to promote his uniquely valuable works through many channels, such as education, online sources and social networks.The foundation has recently published, in collaboration with the University of California Press, a Catalogue Raisonne and Panel Paintings, a 1946 – 1994 catalog of Francis’ works, which consists of a printed book and 2 DVDs. The whole package also includes photos, writings, video and films about Francis’ work. Just like Francis believed that his life was a series of adventures and challenges, the Sam Francis Foundation wants to expand and promote his sense of wonder and his freedom to explore the world through the artistic instincts. In 2010, artist and filmmaker Jeffrey Perkins released the documentary called The Painter Sam Francis. This valuable documentary, filmed between the late 60s and the early 90s, brings together interviews with friends, family, and professional partners of Francis.   The main elements and the very heart of Francis’ work have always been light and space. This is not an innovative element in the world of painting - what is unique in the oeuvre of Sam Francis is the way he translated the everlasting play of light and space not only into the regular painterly works but also into alternative three-dimensional pieces. Francis’ paintings are valued historically for their one of a kind aesthetic vision, but at the same time, his curious mind and spirit have won him an amazing legacy of a innovative renaissance man. The artist is represented by Galerie Thalberg Zurich, Kunzt.gallery, Puccio Fine Art, Rosenbaum Contemporary Bal Harbour, Rosenbaum Contemporary Boca Raton, Jane Kahan Gallery New York and Woodward Gallery New York. Sam Francis lived and worked between the United States, France, and Japan. ",282
Dennis Oppenheim,"Dennis Oppenheim was an American conceptual artist, performance artist, earth artist, sculptor and photographer. He was born in small town Electric City, Washington state, in 1938. There was not much art about, but his mother encouraged his early aptitude. His father was an engineer, which may explain Oppenheim's forays into sculpture with primitive engines and moving parts. After high school he attended the California College of the Arts in Oakland, then Stanford University. He moved to New York in 1966, later acquiring a house and a studio, plus several assistants, in Manhattan. In 1969, documentation for Oppenheim’s land art project Annual Rings was shown at John Gibson Gallery, New York. In addition to gallery shows at Galerie Yvon Lambert, Paris, and Galerie Francoise Lambert, Milan, works were included in ""When Attitude Becomes Form"" in Berne and ""Earth Art"" at Cornell University, Ithaca - two of nineteen group shows the artist participated in that year. Since the 1960s Oppenheim's works have been included regularly in international group exhibitions, at such venues as the Museum of Modern Art, Centre George Pompidou, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Venice Biennale and Documenta in Kassel. Solo exhibitions have included the Tate Gallery, London, the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Major retrospectives were presented at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, Musée d'Art Contemporain in Montreal and P.S.1 in New York. Dennis Oppenheim's practice employed all available methods: writing, action, performance, video, film, photography, and installation with and without sound or monologue. He used mechanical and industrial elements, fireworks, common objects and traditional materials, materials of the earth, his own or another's body. He created works for interior, exterior and public spaces. Seminal works include Annual Rings, 1968, Reading Position for Second Degree Burn, 1970, Attempt to Raise Hell, 1974, Scan, 1979, Digestion. Gypsum Gypsies, 1989, Device to Root Out Evil, 1997 and Bus Home, 2003.

His final work was Swarm, 2011, which is located on the campus of Norwalk Community College in Norwalk, CT. Dennis Oppenheim lived and worked in New York City from 1968 and also in Springs, East Hampton, since 1985. Amy Plumb began as his assistant in 1977 and became his wife in 1998. He was good friends with his third wife, the sculptor Alice Aycock, and the artists Roger Welch, Bill Beckley and Vito Acconci. His first two children Erik and Kristin and granddaughter Erin live in Brooklyn, New York. His third child, Chandra, lives in Maine with her daughter Issa. Oppenheim received a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1969, National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships in 1974 and 1982, an Excellence in Transportation award from the State of California in 2003, and a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Vancouver Sculpture Biennale in 2007. He died in New York in 2011.",283
Sandro Chia,"Sandro Chia is an Italian artist, a member of the Italian Transavanguardia movement in the 1970s and 1980s, best known for his Neo-Expressionist paintings and sculptures, in which he contemplates the figural through dynamic compositions and bold use of line and color. Born in 1946 in Florence, Italy, he has studied at the Istituto d’Arte and then at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence where he graduated in 1969. After graduation, Chia traveled to India, Turkey, and throughout Europe, before moving to Rome in 1970, where he fully developed his expressionistic formal style, gradually moving away from conceptual works towards a more figurative style of painting. He began exhibiting his work in 1971, a year after moving to Rome, later referring to his early productions as ‘mythical conceptual art’. After a residency in Germany, he went to New York and held his first US exhibition at the Sperone Westwater Gallery. The following year he moved to New York City, where he will remain for over two decades, with frequent trips back to Montalcino, near Siena in Italy. A painter, draughtsman, printmaker and sculptor, Chia’s pictorial language is colorful and eclectic, and explores earlier art movements, including Italian Mannerism, Cubism, Futurism, and Fauvism, aiming to connect the present and the past. His motifs stem from antique and Christian mythologies, and are sometimes understood as a humorous, flippant commentary on religious writings. Typically capturing his subjects in moments of movement, his works convey a sense of drama and heightened emotion, with his vivid palette and energetic brushstrokes echoing the exaggerated expressions of his figures. Often making reference to Italy's history and culture in his works, he has employed traditional mediums such as bronze sculpture, mural painting, and mosaic. In the late 1970s he established himself as a major artist of the movement in Italian figurative painting known as the Transavanguardia. In large, vibrantly colored oil paintings such as In Strange and gloomy Waters a White Spot Shines, a Little Girl Flies by my Side he celebrated man’s sensuality, animal vitality and closeness to the natural world. Cultural and specifically art-historical references abound, with a swirling, rhythmic application of paint in themes of eroticism, melancholy and death. In Water Bearer and related paintings, larger-than-life, heroic male figures imbued with an enigmatic sense of mission are Chia’s main protagonists as manifestations of his own identity; he explored similar imagery not only in drawings and prints but also in sculptures cast in bronze and sometimes exuberantly painted in vivid colors, as in Man with Ram. Chia's work has been exhibited extensively at institutions worldwide, including the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museo Rufino Tamayo in Mexico City, and the Nationalgalerie in Berlin. Chia took part at documenta 7 in Kassel in 1980, and most recently, his work has been shown at the Tate Modern in London, and at the Venice Biennale. Today he lives between Miami, Rome and his Castello Romitorio wine-making estate in Montalcino, where he owns a vineyard, and personally designs the labels for the wines produced.",284
Jo Ellen Van Ouwerkerk,"Jo Ellen Van Ouwerkerk is an American painter. She employs various techniques on canvas, and her paintings invariably feature stunning female figures.  The heroines of Van Ouwerkerk’s paintings are placed in the foreground. They are seductive, almost erotic in nature, reminiscent of nineteenth century feminine icons, although their facial expressions are pensive. Their fantasies are often revealed in the paintings’ backgrounds, through details that give the compositions an air of surrealism, and can sometimes even be defined as ghostly or ominous. They can be presented in tiny details, as is the case with She Listened to the Bird Sing Until Bees Came Out of Its Mouth, or complex scenes as in Women in Piles of Wood Waiting to Burn. The women in the paintings rarely seem disturbed by their surroundings, however.  Similar to her heroines, the colors in Van Ouwerkerk’s works resemble turn-of-the-century photographs. They are generally downplayed and muted, and only an occasional detail is colored more vividly, to further emphasize the contrast between foreground and background, and give off the feel of separate realities. Van Ouwerkerk is represented by Woodward Gallery in New York. ",285
Matthew Langley,"Matthew Langley is an American contemporary artist born in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1963. He is well known for his abstract paintings.  He studied at Virginia Commonwealth University, and received his BFA from Corcoran School of Art, Washington DC, in 1985. Titles of the pieces are almost as important as the paintings themselves, for their purpose is to forge connections between the viewers and artworks. The idea is to prepare the viewers and open them to thoughts that could somewhat influence the understanding of the paintings. Inspiration goes from Color Field paining and the works of Morris Louis and Gene Davis, abstraction of Mark Rothko, Richard Diebenkorn, to physical paint-handling of Gerhard Richter. After all the years of being an artist, everyday life is almost enough to drive his work forward.  Langley uses drywall taping knives to create powerful underpainting, which always end up covered with more elegant, but lesser expressive layer. Recently, he is interested in the balance between colors and processes, mark makings and fields, scales and relationships, between what is planned and what is improvised. Because of that, the artist is able to create pieces which are interesting on both intellectual and visual level. His works are included in several public collections, e.g. Ernst and Young, The International Museum of Collage, Assemblage and Construction, the Doris Patz Collection at University of Maryland University College, PNC Bank University of Baltimore, and many more.  He is represented by IdeelArt gallery in London, UK.  All images courtesy of the artist.",286
Ramon Enrich,"Architecture is all around us. Wherever we look, we can see something that we created, some kind of construction, be it the lone house in the hills, or majestic cities made out of thousands of objects. But don’t forget the bigger picture. Don’t forget the landscapes, which seem to be powerful enough to swallow anything man-made. Welcome to the world of Ramon Enrich and his unique conversations between architecture and landscapes. The artist creates his mysterious world using the personal language of shapes and symbols rather than simply accepting the already existing forms and rules.   His style could be described as architectural painting. Dipping his toes in abstraction, Enrich constructs his own reality, both inspired and limited by geometry. Light is intensely oblique, and the paintings, devoid of any human presence, have an atmosphere that is enigmatic and intriguing. The theatrical design is loaded with irony, as the artist tries to bring to light what is hidden and to enable making connections without explaining anything. Ramon’s most recent work brings an increase in precision and strictness, inspired, without a doubt, with Mediterranean. The starting point of his work is a sketch, which is then worked on. Mistakes are a part of the process, but the artist hates them. However, when one does occur, he will simply paint over it. And many times, this painting-under-a-painting works really well, because it gives the piece a kind of pre-life, an energy which bursts out and enriches the work.   Enrich was born in Igualada, a town near Barcelona. After his studies of Fine Arts in Barcelona, he decided to travel and try to see some references to art and to painting. Grants he received at the time helped him significantly. The main idea behind visiting artists like Donald Judd and David Hockney, beside from learning about the art from them, was to see how they organized their lives as artists. He belongs to a generation which reconsiders reality, based on constructed and a pinch of metaphysical figuration limited by the rules of geometry. Since 1990, he has exhibited both as a solo artist and in group shows. His artworks are included in public and private collections in Spain, USA, Germany, Japan and France.   The paintings of Ramon Enrich look like stages prepared for the plays. And that is their beautiful aspect because the viewers are allowed to be the directors and imagine and stage the plays and stories they like. Everything is provided, starting with a rich chromatic register, ironic use of architectural structures and a strong sense of perspective. Every single one of Enrich’s artworks invites the viewers to fill its endless landscape with the story they find most appropriate. It is quite rare for the viewers to be the finishing touch themselves in a wonderful process of painting.  He is represented by the Artistics, an online gallery based in Paris.

Klara Kristalova,"A sculptor from Prague, Czech Republic, Klara Kristalova works mostly in ceramics and relies on the Meissen porcelain technique. She also works with plaster, bronze, wood and ceramics to create small scale figures which often allude to ornamental objects. The odd yet familiar world she has created is populated by characters who are peculiar, alone, quiet, and perhaps lost.  Born in former Czechoslovakia in 1967, Kristalova moved to Sweden with her parents when she was only a year old. She studied at the Royal University College of Fine Art, Stockholm. Kristalova draws inspiration from traditional myths, fairy tales and other literary sources such as Hans Christian Andersen, Selma Lagerlöf, Gösta Berling, old DC comics, and Oscar Wilde, adding her own twists. Creating sculptures of fantastic quality, who morph into flora, fauna, and other natural elements, the artist explores memory, trauma, and the lost territory of childhood. Kristalova's practice is rooted in the decorative and craft tradition of 18th-century Meissen porcelain figurines, which had a formative influence on the style and development of European porcelain sculptures. However, the artist adds her own touch by manipulating the glazes so that they often run and bleed into each other, becoming more painterly than sculpted. These pieces are often exhibited in old wooden cabinets, evoking 18th and 19th-century Wunderkammer or Cabinet of Curiosities.  ",288
Gina Werfel,"Gina Werfel is an American abstract painter whose work uses vivid color, lyrical gesture, and complex compositional structures to explore harmonies within visual space. Raised on Long Island, she currently lives and works near Sacramento, California, where she is a Professor of Art at the University of California, Davis. Werfel received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Kirkland College (now part of Hamilton College), in Clinton, New York and post-graduated at the New York Studio School. She then earned her Masters of Fine Arts degree from Columbia University in New York. She is also the recipient of a number of prestigious fellowships and grants, and leads a distinguished career as a professor of art, a visiting university lecturer, and an artist in residence at important schools and institutions around the world.  Werfel works with a mixture of oils, acrylics and mixed media on canvas. Her background is in landscape painting, which helped her develop a keen eye for light, color relationships, and compositional harmony. As she transitioned into abstraction, she heightened her ability to use those sensibilities to convey emotional and atmospheric states within pictorial space. In her abstract paintings, she employs expressive, lyrical gestures that create bursts of movement and energy. Her color choices create a range of tones from the muted and serene to the vibrant and electric. In addition to traditional brushwork, she incorporates mediums like spray paint and stencils to build layered, complex, and expressive compositions.  Werfel has studied and taught all over the world. She has found inspiration in the variations between the pictorial landscapes to which she has been exposed: for example, the interplay between the hills and light of Northern California and the textures and colors of Brittany, France. She is interested in the way everyday experiences influence her paintings. She may become inspired early in the day by a spontaneous gesture then be guided later by the view from her studio. In the end, her compositions do not reference any one thing. They are examinations of the qualities of light, transparency and color in space. Werfel has exhibited extensively in solo and group shows throughout the United States, with recent solo exhibitions at the American University in Paris, France, and at the Prince Street Gallery in New York City.  The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",289
Clay Johnson,"Clay Johnson is an American abstract painter whose reductivist compositions explore the relationships between color, form, and texture. Johnson earned his B.A. in studio art and art history from Duke University in 1985. Afterwards, he worked as studio manager for the painter Robert Natkin. Says Johnson, Most of what I know about painting I learned from Bob.  Johnson has said he does not believe in inspiration. Instead, he believes in evolution. He is motivated by process. Rather than being planned ahead of time, the work emerges through a series of critical responses to previous decisions. He begins each painting by taping off one or more horizon lines. His initial color choice then guides the composition forward. Certain elements—a color, a line, a texture—are destroyed, while other elements incite unimagined… His intuition is guided by visceral reactions to the physical qualities of paint, the quest for pictorial balance, and the emergence of abstract relationships. The most important part of this process is editing. As Johnson says,   Reviewing new paintings by Johnson in 2016, artist Camellia El-Antably wrote,   Johnson has exhibited in numerous group and solo exhibitions throughout the United States. His work is in the collections of the Kimpton Corporation and the University of Wyoming Art Museum, among others. He lives and works in Laramie, Wyoming. ",290
Anton Kannemeyer,"Anton Kannemeyer is a South African comics artist, who is also known under the pseudonym Joe Dog. Since the early 1990s, he actively produces critically charged and often very subversive comics by underlining the omnipresent racism and colonialism in the specific manner of dark humor. In 1992 together with Conrad Botes, Kannemeyer co-founded the satirical magazine Bitterkomix and was criticized for making use of offensive. This notable artist gained critical recognition after appropriating the famous comic character Tintin and making him into a white African, depicted either a white liberal or a racist white imperialist in Africa. Kannemeyer earned a professorship at the University of Pretoria, Technikon Witwatersrand, and also lectured at the University of Stellenbosch. ",291
Mike Solomon,"An American abstract artist, Mike Solomon is best known for grid-like abstract canvases anchored in the early Modernism. All of his work invite reflection and contemplation, embodying the fundamental qualities perceived signature. Capturing the essence of these qualities, his art speaks about the psychological properties of memory. A son of Syd Solomon, a celebrated Abstract Impressionist who was a central figure in the New York art scene of the 1950s and ‘60s, he was immersed into art from an early age. He studied at the Skowhegan School of Sculpture and Painting in Maine (1975) and continued his studies at the Yale Summer School of Music and Art, Norfolk, Connecticut (1978) where he was influenced by artist Joan Snyder. Through the years, Solomon has explored a range of subjects, styles, and concepts using various materials from traditional watercolors to roplex and acrylic gels to beeswax. His works are characterized by transparency, as he explores the effects of light penetrating color. In his more recent works, the artist paints modest shapes across the mulberry paper and then layers resin on each sheet, creating a hallucinatory grid. Fascinated with the grid early in his career, it remained a central structural element in his paintings and sculpture. ",292
Manish Nai,"A contemporary Indian artist, Manish Nai is best known for his composite and multiform work summons a set of references and affinities from both Arte Povera and procedural art. In his practice, the artist uses discarded materials, cardboard, papers and fabrics, setting up the protocols and systems of artistic creation in themselves to define the final art object. Born 1980 in Gujarat, India, Nai attained a Diploma in Drawing and Painting from the L.S. Raheja School of Art in Mumbai. He has held solo exhibitions at Kavi Gupta ElizabethSt.; Galerie Karsten Greve, Paris; Galerie Karsten Greve, St. Mortiz; Galerie Mirchan-dani + Steinruecke, Mumbai; Galerie KarstenGreve, Cologne; and Galerie Gebr. Lehmann, Berlin, among others. In 2014, Nai was selected for the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Coming from a family of textile merchants, Nai began exploring the opportunities offered by jute, a plant fibre widely used in India, turning it into the raw material of monolithic sculptural ensembles with striking and perfectly straight edges. Contiguous to a wooden structure, Nai’s compressed sculptures fall within the frontier of two and three dimensional planes. After refining his work in jute and canvas for nearly a decade, the artist began experimenting with illusionistic murals, photography, and sculpture. ",293

Steffi Moellers,"Steffi Moellers is a self-taught German contemporary artist best known for her colorful abstract paintings. She studied law but was creative her whole life. Sadly, she lost her first child in 1995, and it was after that painful experience she began transforming emotions into colors. At first, she painted completely self-taught, slowly developing her skills in several courses and workshops with various artists in Germany and the US. During her 4-year stay in California (2011-2014), she was a working and exhibiting artist, part of the Magoski Arts Colony close to Los Angeles. The creative cooperation of more than 30 artists, each with a different art form and style, significantly influenced Moellers’ style of painting.  Creating intuitively and spontaneously, she aspires to achieve the perfect balance between chaos and calm in each of her works. The choice of color, brush strokes, and the overall dynamics are influenced by her channeled emotions. “I use bold colors in almost all of my paintings, as their positive energy symbolizes lust for life. In my paintings, I express my current state of mind. I follow my instinct and utilize many different techniques and materials.” Steffi Moellers has exhibited her work in the US, Germany, Italy, and Austria. She works and lives in Eichenau near Munich with her husband and their three children.  ",296
Tim Fawcett,"Tim Fawcett is a British painter whose works explore visual dichotomies - concrete versus abstract, discipline versus freedom, and order versus chaos. Having previously established himself as a figurative painter, a turning point for the artist came while he taught adults with learning disabilities. The profound joy his students showed in their uninhibited approach to painting was “life affirming and hugely inspirational”, providing Fawcett with a new purpose and drive, “to explore and develop a new approach and process, a leap of faith into trusting instinct, spontaneity and experience.” His current work combines weathered surfaces, scrawled text, raw, gestural marks, and hints of childlike figuration, positioning itself at a midpoint between abstraction and representation. Originally from Cambridge, Tim Fawcett studied Fine Art at Sunderland and Cambridge with PGCE training at Brighton. Since 2016, he has been living in Isle of Wight, fully committed to his artistic practice.   Featured image: Tim Fawcett - Curtains Included, 2020 (detail).

Oliver Dorfer,"Oliver Dorfer is an Austrian artist known for a deeply mnemonic practice saturated with various associations and signs open for interpretation. His aesthetic is influenced by German Expressionism, graffiti art of the 1980s, as well as the Japanese anime. By combing figuration and abstraction, Dorfer constructs bewildering compositions saturated with dense and expressive strokes. Together with Alexander Netusil, Anatole Ak, Reinhold Rebhandl, and Robert Mittringer, he founded the artist group K5 in 1989, while a year later he became a member of the artistic organization called MAERZ. Dorfer's works were in various solo and group exhibitions, and are held mostly in Austrian public and private collections. ",301
Judith Godwin,"An American abstract painter, Judith Godwin uses the gestural methods and expressive color of Abstract expressionism to convey her responses to life and nature. Her work is influenced by environmental causes, gardening, modern dance and Zen. Born in Suffolk, Virginia, Godwin was inspired and encouraged to pursue painting by her father, who was interested in architecture and landscape gardening. She attended Mary Baldwin College and continued her studies on Richmond Professional Institute, now Virginia Commonwealth University, and later Art Students League of New York. She also attended the Hans Hoffmann School of Fine Arts, where she met Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning and Marcel Duchamp. She once explained that painting “is an act of freedom and a realization that images generated by the female experience can be a powerful and creative expression for all humanity.” Her early works were characterized by sweeping, broad gestures, arcs and geometrics reminiscent of dance moves. During the 1950s and early 1960s, her palette was much more subdued and darker and limited in its range of color. Over the course of her career, her color palette has evolved, first softening and more recently becoming bright again. ",302
Joyce Weinstein,"A highly respected New York artist, Joyce Weinstein brings an abstract sensibility to landscape imagery, capturing the feeling of beautiful countryside. Depicting rolling hills, mountains and distant views, the ever-changing qualities of the sky, fields, woods and streams, old barns, haystacks, and weeds and wildflowers, she articulates the essence of what she has seen and felt. Born in New York in 1931, Weinstein studied at City College of New York and the Art Students League. Her first solo exhibition was in 1953 at the Perdalma Gallery in New York City, where she had additional solo shows from 1954 through 1956. She continued to actively show her work in the decades that followed, receiving critical acclaim nationally and internationally. Using a combination of techniques - washes, impasto, and contrasts of texture and hue, Weinstein creates dynamic works in which abstraction obscures hints of the natural world. Her works represent what the artist describes as “another kind of landscape painting, more ‘real’ than literal interpretations.” Having an uncanny ability to create a fine equilibrium of both spontaneity and control, she uses an assertive mark-making to create wobbly, sketchy, and raw lines that form contours that approximate fields and countryside, while areas of scratched and scribbled color convey water, light, and organic growth. ",303
Patrick Chamberlain,"Patrick Chamberlain is an American artist known for his intriguing colorful paintings reminiscent of the early post-war abstraction. By employing different techniques and styles, he developed a unique visual language characterized by the explorations of visual phenomena, as well as figurative and conceptual elements. The appropriation of methods such as reduction or construction enabled Chamberlain to explore further philosophical and formal concerns that he encountered while rethinking various pictorial issues. The unusual life experience of a Jehovah’s Witness who turned to study philosophy at the University of Victoria in Canada, and working a myriad of jobs spanning from sheep farming and gallery assistant to the practice of psychoanalytic psychotherapy had a tremendous impact on his lifelong passion of creating art.

Tommaso Fattovich,Tommaso Fattovich is an Italian abstract painter who deploys the Surrealist strategy of automatism to create works that convey feelings of desolation and decay. ,305
Linda Coppens,"Linda Coppens is a Belgian artist whose colorful abstract paintings reflect her own quiet battle against the increasingly frenetic world we are living in. She mobilizes color, texture, and gestural mark-making as a structure for the creation of compositions that evoke a sense of emotional balance in the viewer. Fascinated by the human mind with all its complex mysteries and by the immense beauty of nature, the artist finds inspiration and process in life itself. A process-oriented painter, Coppens never has a plan or works from sketches. Instead, she simply starts painting and allows one mark, shape, or color to suggest the next color or gesture. Born in Aalst, she moved to Brussels, where she studied at the VUB, earning a Master in Psychology. Coppens remained interested in art and, after twenty years, decided to do it properly. She started formal training at the Art Academy in Liedekerke, where she obtained her drawing and painting certificate and discovered her passion for abstract art. Linda Coppens spends most of her time in Spain. Featured image: Linda Coppens - Poetry of life 6, 2020 (detail).

Jason Engelund,"San Francisco-based artist Jason Engelund merges aspects of painting and photography in ways that expand the definition of both mediums. His compositions are grounded in the realm of landscape, where foreground and background elements lead the eye inwards towards a rational picture space. Engelund upends that sensible grasp of visual reality, which we have come to expect from a landscape photograph, dissolving into an abstracted dreamscape in which the mind is tantalized by psychedelic color fields, burned out light blots, flashes of text, and visceral encounters with paint. Positioned somewhere between memory and metaphor, the work invites viewers to question pre-supposed limitations of the photographic image.  Engelund earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts with Distinction at the California College of Arts and Crafts and his Master of Fine Arts from the University of California, Davis. In addition to numerous private collections, work by Engelund is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Photographic Arts of San Diego.       Featured image: Jason Engelund in studio, 2020.

Brooke Noel Morgan,"Materiality and soul are essential to the work of Nashville-based multimedia artist Brooke Noel Morgan. Her muted, biomorphic abstractions are intimately expressive of both her conscious, and subconscious, connections with the natural world. Through mindful use of gesture, texturally and scale, Morgan strives to create objects that will instigate moments of introspection for viewers.  Minimal and mindful, her works make simple, declarative visual statements that foster soulful relationships between human sensibilities and built spaces. Through her lifestyle brand Nomad Collective, Morgan brings her own artworks into conversation with the works of other like-minded artists and craftspeople from around the world, introducing the global marketplace to the possibilities of a sublime, aesthetic collaboration between art and life.

Amelia Coward,"Amelia Coward is a British abstract artist known for her explorations into mixing, blending, and grading colors. Having received training based upon the color theory teachings of Josef Albers, she focuses on the interaction of colors, creating works that are carefully composed studies of spatial balance between geometric colored elements such as circles and stripes. The mathematical process plays a central role in shaping the paintings. She uses “a laser cutter to make precise geometric dots and stripes from the organic natural painted surface of soft birch wood. I allow the wood grain surface to shine through my carefully mixed paints, reassembling the cut wood shapes allowing the wood grain and my painted gradations of color to continue to follow its natural pattern.” Influenced heavily by her woven textile training, Amelia’s artworks range from “highly detailed dot pieces containing sometimes 1000’s of raised hand-painted dots to large scale striped pieces comprise of contrasting scales and bold clashing colors.” Born in Dartford, Kent, she holds a 1st class Honors from Central St Martins and an MA from the Royal College of Art. Amelia Coward lives and works in a traditional Oast Barn in the Kent countryside, where she successfully combines her prolific artistic output with her commercial giftware business, Bombus.   ",312

Farhad Moshiri,"One of the most interesting Iranian artists today, Farhad Moshiri has developed his own artistic style in which he blurs the boundaries between Iranian and Western cultures. Drawing inspiration from pop and conceptual art, comics, classical portraiture, advertising and religious iconography, he creates witty but thought-provoking pieces using everyday objects such as household items as well as sparkly, luxurious materials including crystals, sequins, jewels, gold leaf, and pearls. Moshiri gained international recognition in 2008 when his stunning mixed media work Eshgh (Love) achieved an auction sale of more than one million dollars, making him the first Iranian contemporary artist to beat the six-zero mark.[1]  Born in 1963, in Shiraz, one of the most populous cities in Iran, Moshiri relocated to Los Angeles at the age of fifteen to pursue his further education. During his studies at the California Institute of the Arts, the artist encountered such names as Michael Asher, John Baldessari and Don Buchla.[2] At the same time, he experimented with a wide range of media including installations, video art and painting. Upon graduation in 1984, he spent several years in the US and returned to his native country in 1991. A decade after Moshiri came back to Tehran, he became internationally known for his large-scale oil paintings of jars and bowls that served as a metaphor for desire, life and memory.    Iranian artist uses a variety of techniques and materials in his practice, ranging from traditional Iranian embroidery to paint diffused through cake icing dispensers. One of his most famous installation to date was made using hundreds of variously colored kitchen knives to create some exquisite typography.[3] By sticking knives into the wall of Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin in 2009, he spelled out Life is Beautiful in cursive creating a nice statement considering the fact that it is made of something that has the ability to destroy. I’m so fucking happy, Comfort, I got sunshine, Paradise and Run like hell are some of his similar knife works that spell out creative and thought-provoking messages.    Recognized for his ironic pieces of art that represent hybrids between traditional Iranian forms and those of the globalized pop culture widespread in his country, Moshiri’s artworks are often very fantastical, but at the end, they have a cynical and sarcastic note as the punch line. In all of his works, Moshiri provides the viewers with a message that might seem witty and amusing at first sight, but after a closer inspection, it succeeds in raising discussion in a western, middle-eastern and global context. He has participated in numerous group and more than twenty one-man exhibitions at such places as Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin in Hong Kong and Paris, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Salzburg, Galerie Rodolphe Janssen in Brussels, Daneyal Mahmood Gallery, Chelsea NY, Albareh Gallery, Bahrain, and others. His work is included in the collections of the François Pinault Collection, the British Museum, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and Dubai’s Farjam Collection.[4]    Sources:  ",314
Nathan Sawaya,"A grown man playing with toys? It doesn’t sound great. It feels like a waste of precious time. Nathan Sawaya fits that description. At first. But then, after one look at any of his creations, all the complexity of his sculptures kicks in. The magnificence of his talent. All the patience necessary for just one average piece. And yet, his love for the medium gives him both strength and inspiration, and he has evolved from a beginner, still uncertain about himself and his skills, into an artist, one of few masters of this particular technique in the whole wide world. Despite the conflict between the imposed limitations of Legos and his own creative urges, the sculptor is strict about not manipulating the bright color palette or shape of the brick, a rule that proved particularly challenging when reproducing the works of art.[1]  Born in Colville, Washington and raised in Veneta, Oregon, Sawaya studied at the New York University. After a number of years of being a corporate lawyer, he dropped everything and began his creative endeavor of creating sculptures using only Lego. One of the first artists to introduce this new medium to the world, he is obsessive about his craftsmanship, and his sculptures undeniably possess beauty and playfulness. He grabbed the attention of both critics and viewers with his first exhibition and has since been at one of the top positions in the world of contemporary art. His work can be described as somewhere between Surrealism and Pop Art, but it’s not really a part of both worlds. Rather, it’s a new dimension where the sculptor plays with material, colors, shapes, but also light and perspective, and creates masterpieces. His love for the medium is unmatched – even when he's not creating, he often gets a need to breakout a set every once in a while.[2] It seems funny because, compared to the millions of bricks that are in his studio, he doesn’t really keep any Lego at home. However, there are times when he feels the need to open a new set and simply follow the instructions.    He possesses an amazing ability to transform those tiny bits into something new. That ability, complemented by his attention to details such as color perfection and scale, allows him to conceptualize the action of the subject matter, enabling him to create fine art out of something that is usually thought of as an ordinary toy. He is inspired by some of the greatest painters in the history, from Leonardo and his Mona Lisa, over Edvard Munch and The Scream, to Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring and Rodin’s Thinker. All of these artworks were given a new life and an extra dimension by their creator. Working within the limitations of his chosen medium, he sculpts artworks whose overall effect is more allusion than illusion.[3] This hardly means they aren’t impressive. In fact, they are amazing on several different levels. Sawaya’s ambition is great, his skill even greater. Some of the sculptures amaze in scale (The dinosaur consists of over 80,000 bricks, and the Moai figure from Easter Island has in itself more than 75,000 bricks). His most famous piece, titled Yellow, is a life-sized sculpture of a man ripping open his chest, revealing and spilling what’s inside – more Legos. As the artist admits, many of his pieces are a reflection of himself.[4]   In November 2015, the viewers had an opportunity to see a hundred new sculptures for the very first time. The thematic have slightly changed, and the name of the exhibition provides more than a hint - Art of the Brick: DC Comics. The show is dedicated to the characters of the DC Universe, both good and bad ones. There are villains, but there are also heroes. Sawaya was interested in exploring the relationship between the good and evil, the right and wrong. So he naturally turned to stories of heroes and villains written on the pages of various DC comics. The whole world knows about Batman and Superman, and these characters can certainly be powerful inspirations. As a child, the sculptor grew up watching the animated TV program Superfriends, and his favorites were the popular Justice League characters. But as he dove deeper into that universe, one of his favorite heroes became Bunker, who uses the creative energy of his mind to build brick-like objects. There was something about that power that stroke a chord with the artist.[5] Sawaya donated a sculpture of Catwoman to the We Can Be Heroes campaign and it began something that would turn out to be a wonderful relationship with DC and Warner Bros.[6] A simple act of donation marked the birth of a completely new series that gained international popularity. The sculptures make Sawaya even more famous, turning him into a hero of a Lego world.  Sources:  ",315
Allen Jones,"Allen Jones is a critically acclaimed British artist best known for Pop Art-oriented paintings, sculptures, and lithography. His entire body of work is primarily recognized for the usage of female figures found in rather submissive and sexually charged poses reminiscent of fetish and BDSM practices in his early works. However, with the flow of time, his compositions became more lyrical and driven by the aesthetic of fashion shows and cabaret. Despite the fact Jones’ approach is often interpreted as misogynistic (especially his fiberglass sculptures of women as furniture), the artist is internationally recognized for his domains, so his works are held in major state and private institutions. Jones also taught at the Chelsea School of Art in London and the Hochschule der Kunste in Berlin. ",316
Atelier Van Lieshout,"Atelier Van Lieshout (AVL) is a multidisciplinary collective in the field of contemporary art, design, and architecture. It was founded by Joep van Lieshout in 1995 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Born in Rotterdam, where he currently lives and works, Joep van Lieshout graduated from the Rotterdam Art Academy Van Lieshout. He quickly rose to fame with projects that travelled between design and art.

Atelier's work has been exhibited in a range of venues, including Pioneer Works, New York City, Design Museum, London, NDSM-Wharf, Amsterdam, Alte National Galerie, Berlin, Ruhrtriennale, Bochum, De Pont Museum, Tilburg, La Friche le Belle de Mai, Marseille, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen – Submarine Wharf, Rotterdam and Mumok, Vienna. AVL is part of the permanent collections of institutions such as FNAC, Paris; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Prada Foundation, Milan; Ludwig Forum, Aachen; Folkwang Museum, Essen; Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Zürich. The multidisciplinary practice of the studio includes works on the borders between art, design, and architecture, exploring the thin line between manufacturing art and mass-producing functional objects. These works deal with a number of recurring themes, motives, and obsessions, such as systems, power, autarky, life, sex, and death All of their projects are created in their signature style of provocation—be it political or material.",317
Deborah Claxton,"Deborah Claxton is an American artist, known for her images which only appear to look like oil paintings, but upon closer inspection, it can be noticed that they are made of small pieces of paper pierced glued to a board. Claxton has been making art her whole life, but this practice started 20 years ago, around 1995, when she wanted to incorporate her love for color, drawing and sculpture into one unique kind of work. She wanted to work in a medium which would allow her to be in a direct contact with the materials she was using. Debora Claxton is fond of the idea that she can assemble images by using vivid, untouched colors, and she find this technique perfect for her practice.  The process of creation involves several stages. She first begins with outlining her subject, which is followed by drawing more details and deciding which color will “occupy” which section. The individual shapes from the design are subsequently transmitted to the accordingly colored papers. Before that, Deborah applies adhesive to the back of the paper. In that way, the shapes are ready to be applied to the board once she cuts them out. Finally, the pieces are combined and any mistake is righted. The last stage is applying a number of layers of varnish to protect the image. Since the process is so detailed and complex, it can take a couple of months for Claxton to finish only one piece. Claxton received the academic training at Maryland College of Art and Design and Corcoran School of Art in Washington DC. She also graduated from Syracuse University School of Art in the state of New York. She also had numerous exhibitions, and has collaborated with many artists. Some of her more notable exhibitions include the 2008 Extreme Paper, and the 2013 exhibition titled Sur-real, both of which were organized by Woodward gallery. Her works are represented by them.

Leonard Baskin,"American artist Leonard Baskin was an illustrator, printmaker, and sculptor best known for his portrayals of human figures, often exaggerated, bloated, malformed, and animal-like. At the time, when the main focus was on abstract expressionism, the artist chose figurative art. As a son of a Rabin, he drew inspiration from Judaism and the Jewish Orthodox community in Brooklyn. Other themes that often appeared in his work come from Greek mythology, poetry, and natural history. He founded The Gehenna Press, the first fine art press in the U.S. Today, Baskin’s work is part of numerous international collections, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Library of Congress, Seattle Art Museum, the Vatican Museums, Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Gallery of Art, to name a few.   From a young age, Baskin, born in 1922 in New Jersey, knew he would become a sculptor. The artist studied at New York University’s School of Architecture and Allied Arts. However, it was at Yale University that he was introduced to printing and founded The Gehenna Press in 1942, which published works by Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Anthony Hecht, and Baskin’s illustrations inspired by William Blake’s work. The artist went on to study at the Accademia di Belle Arte in Florence, and the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris. Leonard Baskin had his first solo exhibition in 1953 at Grace Borgenicht Gallery. The same year he received the Guggenheim fellowship and went on to teach sculpture and printmaking at Smith College in Massachusetts.   Ignoring the trends of the time, Baskin continued creative figurative art throughout his career. Drawing inspiration from Greek mythology and ancient Egypt, the artist created artworks that often featured universal symbols, such as Man with Owl (1960) and Hanged Man (1956). Also, from the Hebrew Bible, he featured in his work some of the most renowned stories: Ruth and Naomi (1978) and Prodigal Son (1976). The artist collaborated with several poets and was inspired by them to create works such as Barlach Dead (1959) and Blake (1955). In his work, Baskin explores the themes of vulnerability, decay, and spiritual death, the condition shared by all in the 20th century. Leonard Baskin said:   The artist has created several monumental memorials, such as Holocaust Memorial (1994) in Michigan and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Presidential Memorial in Washington D.C. In 1969 he received a Gold Medal from the American Academy of Arts. In 2000 The National Foundation of Jewish Culture awarded the artist Jewish Cultural Achievement Award in Visual Arts.

Anya Spielman,"Anya Spielman is an American abstract artist, a student of Wayne Thiebaud. She explores the relationship of binary forms - the tension between humanity and inhumanity. Spielman was born in Berkeley, California in 1966. She earned her degree at the University of California at Davis, majoring Art Studio and Anthropology. After graduating Anya continued to be mentored by Wayne Thiebaud, known for his colorful works depicting commonplace objects and who had been guiding her throughout her formal art education.  Anya was always curious about the things that lie beneath surfaces, so she was driven to experience drawing from cadavers, to work in construction and demolition, participate in informal ethnographic researches or travel alone all over the globe. She spent some time in Paris and then New York where she worked in her Bowery studio in Manhattan. Being both a West Coast and East Coast painter, Spielman returned to her native California in 2005  Spielman derives her inspiration from, at first glance, completely different places and experiences – her pregnancy, early childhood of her two kids, 9/11 and all the way to Japanese blossom explosion of color annual show at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens. Sometimes she even works on up to forty paintings at a time! All of her artworks are characterized by the indissoluble micro and macro aspect of her work, the intensity of saturated color and the submerged language of her work. Anya uses reds and pinks, linking the flesh and blood, and her pale creams, yellows and blues often recall bodily fluids – creating so the pulse of life.  Spielman’s large oil on canvas titled Petites Boules was exhibited in Uruguay via The US Department of State Art in Embassies Program. In 2007, during his  visit to Uruguay, President Bush was photographed in front of this piece. The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  All images copyright © the artist",320
Ryan McGinness,"A New York-based contemporary artist, Ryan McGinness is known for his psychedelic paintings and sculptures that merge slick biomorphic abstraction with surrealistic imagery. His original extensive vocabulary includes altered corporate logos and symbols, and contemporary iconography, which is used as a base to create his boldly graphic yet graceful works. Born in 1972 in Virginia Beach, McGinness currently lives and works in New York. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. He also worked as a curatorial assistant at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, PA. McGinnes exhibited worldwide, including venues such as Miles McEnery Gallery, New York, NY; Baldwin Gallery, Aspen, CO; Harper’s Books, East Hampton, NY; Nanzuka (AishoNanzuka), Hong Kong, China; Nanzuka (EchoOne), Bangkok, Thailand; Cranbrook Art Museum, Bloomfield Hills, MI; Quint Gallery, San Diego, CA; Kohn Gallery, Los Angeles, C A; Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art, Virginia Beach, VA;  Quint Gallery, La Jolla, CA; and Pace Prints, New York, NY. By recontextualizing often familiar iconography, McGinness creates kaleidoscopic, sprawling compositions that combine abstraction and contemporary visual culture. His layered works often feature flora, fauna, chandeliers, and family crests, as well as imagery from bathroom and street signs, with surprising juxtapositions and endless associations.",321
Simon Vega,"Simon Vega is a Salvadorian artist, known for his sculptures and installations made from various found objects. His pieces serve as a platform to reiterate the political and socio-cultural themes explored throughout his oeuvre. His body of work – which includes drawings, ephemeral sculptures and installations – are all inspired by the informal, self-made architecture and vendor carts found in the streets and marginal areas of his native El Salvador and Central America in global.  Simon Vega was born in 1972 in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador. He attended graduate school in Madrid, and afterwards graduated with a BFA from University of Veracruz in Mexico, and got his Master´s degree in Contemporary Arts from the Complutense University in Madrid in 2006.  Growing up in El Salvador in the late 70s and early 80s, Simon Vega witnessed The Cold War in a period when both the U.S. and the Soviet Union were competing for influence in Central America, among the poverty-stricken nations. These early memories have greatly shaped the artist’s view and approach to the world of contemporary art.   By using shipping crates, plastic, bottles, signs and old TVs, the artist creates sculptures that often parody famous Modernist and mythological buildings and cities, surveillance systems as well as high-tech robots and satellites developed by NASA and the Soviet Space Program during the Cold War.  A great example of Vega’s approach is seen in his installation at Socrates Sculpture Park in New York City. The piece, created in 2011 as a part of The S-Files exhibition, depicts a space module made of soda cans, discarded bottles and iron rods that has apparently crashed into the earth.   Simon Vega has exhibited his work throughout Europe, the United States and Latin America, including the 55th Venice Biennial in Italy and the IX Havana Biennial in Cuba. Vega’s art is in a permanent collection of Perez Art Museum, in Miami, Florida.  All images copyright © the artist",322
Gelitin,"Gelitin is an artistic group of four friends from Vienna, Austria - Tobias Urban, Wolfgang Gantner, Florian Reither and Ali Janka. They share the same goal while creating different types of installations and that is to have fun and enjoy themselves. Their work has a distinct sense of humor throughout.  The group of artists first met at summer camp in 1978. They formed Gelitin in the mid-1990s in Vienna, Austria, and began exhibiting internationally in 1993. Formerly known as Gelatin, they changed their name in 2005. They have exhibited internationally, including the Museum of Fine Arts Leipzig, Sala de Arte Público Siqueiros, Mexico City, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, Fondazione Prada, Milano, Italy, Greene Naftali, New York, USA, Galerie Perrotin Hong Kong and Massimo De Carlo, London. The practice of Gelitin is at the crossroads of humor, spontaneity, childlike naiveté, and blatant sexuality, resulting in over-the-top performances and visually enticing work. Constantly playing with audience participation and collaboration, viewers are invited to join in, defying routine behavior while enjoying art from a new perspective. One of their best known works is The B-Thing in 2000, where they removed one of the windows on the 91st floor of the former World Trade Center complex and temporarily installed a narrow balcony, while a helicopter flew around the scene, taking photographs to be later documented in the book by the same title.

Pierre Yermia,"For more than thirty years, Pierre Yermia has been developing his sculptural practice, confronting strength and fragility, constantly striving to reach and capture moments of precarious and unlikely balance. Filled with human and animal characters, his body of work represents endangered but optimistic and unfazed humanity. The artist tries to simplify the line without making it poorer, always giving it energy, drive, and then an indefinable breath. Everything in his sculpture must appear obvious, and for that, he works a great deal. However, the finished sculpture must never reveal the effort.  He studied at the School of Fines Arts in Toulouse, where he was introduced to sculpture by an extraordinary teacher who became a great friend, Aroldo Zavaroni. Later he continued his studies at the School of Fines Arts in Paris, where he spent four years, from 1984 to 1988. Several traits are clearly visible throughout his work – reduced to bare essentials, the figures’ head dominate long and slender necks, contrasting the elongated shapes with the massive torsos. A never-ending game between full and empty, convex and concave, heavy and light, shapes Yermia’s figures. Placed on frail limbs, his animal and human sculptures defy the laws of gravity. Sometimes ending with monumental sized pieces executed in bronze, medium and small size formats in the preceding stages are a necessity for the sculptor.    Since it gives Yermia a vision of the piece, the artist works a lot on the drawing, in which he already sees the connection of the shape with its space. Upon having a vision, the sculptor makes a very detailed graphic work, making the quality of drawing is essential to the process. Once a framework is conceived, he welds the structure, thus giving his piece a skeleton. Working primarily with plaster, it’s a material that looks rather austere, but has great qualities and makes all the elements of the piece visible – all the good parts, and all the faults. The light on the plaster is radical, and the artist can see the work absolutely bare, just as it is. Re-working the piece comes next, using files and saws, in order to give it the tensions of the shape. Constantly working, Yermia adds and removes, seeking a dimension of strength that comes from a density of the volumes, trying to always make it visible in plaster. In the end, each and every sculpture is an expression of a rush, a pure moment of grace and balance, in which the viewers feel both the frailty of mankind but also its force.    Pierre Yermia’ work is critically acclaimed, and he’s won a number of awards, but several stand out: in 1990, he won the Sculpture award, Lauriers Wiso; Vermeille medal with honours of the Lutèce Internationale Academy in 1991; City of Ernée award in 2000; City of Charanton Lion’s Club award in 2011; and the most recent one, in 2016, the City of Charenton's award. In addition, his works have been regularly exhibited throughout France, but also in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.  He is represented by Artistics, an online art gallery.  ",324
Bharti Kher,"A British-Indian contemporary artist, Bharti Kher is widely known and appreciated for her work in painting, sculpture and installations. Throughout her two-decades-long practice, she has displayed an unwavering relationship with surrealism, narrative, and the nature of things. Born in 1969 in London to Indian parents, Kher studied at Middlesex Polytechnic, Cat Hill, London, UK and later graduated with a B.F.A in painting from Newcastle Polytechnic in 1991. At the age of 23, she moved to New Delhi, where she lives and works today. Drawing from life and its daily rituals, Kher reassesses and transforms their meaning to yield an air of magical realism. Her working process is exploratory, including surveying, looking, collecting, and transforming, as she repositions the viewer’s relationship with the object and initiates a dialogue between metaphysical and material pursuits. In her sculptures, she uses found objects that are witness to their own histories, assembling, juxtaposing and transforming them. She also uses bindi, an iconic personal affect of Indian women, to articulate and animate her themes, acting as a material, much like paint or clay, but with an inherent narrative. In her practice, she defamiliarizes them, making them seem both scientific and mystical. ",325
Melissa Meyer,"For the several decades, Melissa Meyer produces abstract paintings with the particular focus on optical and compositional aspects within the canvas. Her artistic beginnings are associated with the feminist practice and therefore the notable agenda of hers was to introduce woman painting. As the time passed by her activity as an artist and educator was growing she remained true with the initial principles, yet her abstract concepts were changing in direction of experimenting with form and style.  Melissa Meyer was born in 1946, in the Bronx and grew up in Queens. Her studies lasted in between 1968 to 1975 and during that time she conducted a scholarship in Provincetown Workshop. With the help of Helen Frankenthaler, Meyer visited artist community Yaddo in 1974 and experienced and gathered information about completely different approach to the educational and practical process. During the course of time, she became a frequent participant and even a board member. Besides that, the number of grants and residences is impressive including such is one from The American Academy in Rome or from the Pollock – Krasner Foundation. Thanks to her achievements Melissa Meyer was called to teach at the School of Visual Arts in New York where she still works.   Abstraction is a daring and bold direction when it comes to painting since it derives on mapping imaginary gaps and transferring it on canvas. In the case of Meyer’s work, the task to maintain this rather modernist dogma, which is rooted in the opus of Wassily Kandinsky or Abstract Expressionism, is moved forward. She transposes peculiar shapes in motion, forms that are similar to some sort of primitive calligraphic marks. The grid as a base or a frame is just an underlying structure that she uses like any tool. Independently from the media of watercolors or oils, Meyer produces thick, yet transparent constellations consisting of floating and energetic forms.   The rise of the feminist movement in the early 70’s opened a series of questions in regards to the segregated position of woman in patriarchal society. That has reflected the arts in particular and significant essays were written in order to determine why there are no great woman artists, what is female art, etc. During that time Melissa Meyer in collaboration with Miriam Schapiro wrote a text called Femmage within then influential Heresies article. They have introduced femmage as a type of art that was made by the use of materials like cloth, paint, and fabric which had long been associated with women’s activities in the home. According to them, the style undermines the woman heritage and simultaneously recalls quilting and Cubism and has a woman-life context and that it celebrates a private or public event.   By the 2000’s Meyer was rather established and prominent figure so was summoned to manage commissioned murals. That period is interesting in the light of Meyer’s departure from painting to watercolors and her beginnings of working with Photoshop as an aid in the composition of the murals. Among important murals was the one done for Shiodome City Center in Tokyo. After that came a commission for the Queens Hospital Center and the Peninsula Hotel in Shanghai.   The work of Melissa Meyer is included in a large number of both private and public collections from MOMA, over The Metropolitan Museum of Art to The Brooklyn Museum. Melissa Meyer had over 40 solo exhibitions, from 1976 onwards, and has also participated in numerous group shows. The continuity of her art practice suggests openness in regards to a search for new forms and relations between the elements within canvas, as well as subtle resistance and focus in regards to ever changing requests of the art market. The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",326
Christophe Jacrot,"For nearly 8 years, French photographer Christophe Jacrot has been developing an artistic project on major cities of the northern hemisphere in adverse weather conditions, from a very pictorial and emotional approach. Paris, Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo... Taken on the spot, no staging no tricks, Christophe Jacrot's photos show the lesser known side of Megacities transfigured by torrential rain or thick snow. This idea came about when the editor of a tourist guide commissioned him to take some images of Paris under a radiant sky. The appalling weather conditions delayed the assignment and in so doing inspired him instead to produce some less traditional images by shooting the city in the rain.  The photographer finds in ""bad weather"" a visual resource that few exploit. He attempts to capture the subtle lighting and pictorial substance that is offered when the elements are in full rage. Through the lens, these giant concrete and glass jungles reveal their fragile beauty and seem to enter into a battle creating powerful dramatic tension. Constantly on the lookout for the worst weather conditions, Christophe Jacrot observes and patiently waits until a story arises. Often solitary silhouettes, as if lost in a hostile terrain, haunt his movie-like shots. They emphasize the verticality and vastness of these cityscapes and give the photos a highly romantic edge. Where are these characters going? What are they doing out when everyone else seems to have taken shelter? Christophe Jacrot revels in ""images which take you somewhere"": his are very much the beginnings of long distance tales.  Before becoming a photographer, Christophe Jacrot was a moviemaker and directed several award-winning short films (particularly in Avoriaz and Chamrousse film festivals), as well as a feature film (House Arrest in 2000). In 2006, he decided on a return to the favorite past-time of his youth, photography. His first project, initially exhibited in Paris in 2007, culminated in the publication of a book of his photographs, Paris in the Rain, Editions du Chêne.  Since then he has not stopped traveling the northern hemisphere depending on the (bad) weather report. He has photographed Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei in the mist and rain (Hong Kong and Asia in the Rain series) as well as New York in a snowstorm (New York in White) or plunged into darkness after Hurricane Sandy, in October 2012 (New York in Black). More recently, the photographer has been favoring more natural landscapes like Iceland or the Normandy coast which he captured covered with a thick layer of snow or in the midst of a storm respectively (Snjór and Blizzard series). The artist is represented by Artistics.  ",327

Jakob Kirchmayr,"Jakob Kirchmayr is an Austrian artist and illustrator whose associative painting is saturated with symbolism and rawness. He is best known for the expressive drawings rooted in the tradition of Informel, which suggests not only Kirchmayr’s grand skillfulness, but the inner (self-)exploration of themes of human suffering and existence in general. Whether populated by depersonalized figures or deprived of the human presence altogether, these works are representing a visualization of metaphors drawn from the artist’s imagination. ",329

Marcelo Cipis,"The Brazilian artist Marcelo Cipis has been working with illustrations for magazines, newspapers, and books since 1977. He works mainly with drawing and painting with a singular figurative language with references to modernism, design and advertising, as well as an intimate and autobiographical theme infused with humor. Cipis was São Paulo, Brazil in 1959, where he still lives and works. He graduated Architecture and Urbanism from FAU-USP (University of São Paulo) but never practised. He worked at the Contemporary Art Salons of São Paulo in the 1980s, participated in the Berlin-in-São Paulo workshop, at MASP and at the Berlin Kunsthalle in 1988, the year he held his first solo show at the Documenta gallery in São Paulo. He exhibited at the 21st São Paulo International Biennial in 1991 with an installation entitled Cipis Transworld, Art, Industry & Commerce, where he created a booth of a fictitious multinational company with products and advertisements in an area of ​​100 square meters.  Far from following the ""coherence"" demanded by a conservative Sao Paulo in the 1980s and 1990s, Cipis' works have always been based on the diversity of languages ​​and pictorial procedures, very different from each other.

Ale Osollo,"Pushing the boundaries with both materials and references, Ale Osollo is a Mexican contemporary artist known for her paintings and murals. Eager to explore and experiment, she combines non-traditional materials to achieve the epiphany of a new surface. Her portraits and landscapes of figurative subjects are abstracted over and over again, with each layer bringing new re-imagination until the final elements reveal themselves. Osollo’s murals are similar – pure yet layered. Drawing on heritage, she enriches them with symbolism, creating narratives, visual stories infused with her philosophy towards life.  ",332
Sylvia Moritz,"Basedin Grevenbroich, Sylvia Moritz is a German artist and photographer who takes inspiration from nature, environment, the everyday, and the cosmic. With extensive professional experience in the field of photography, she is currently focused on abstract painting. In her own words: “The creative process begins with gestural abstracted forms on the canvas, followed by a confrontation with a pictorial idea, until the moment when the process starts developing its unstoppable momentum and creates its own space.” It is defined by the visible traces of paint, forms, and structures “layer by layer”, altogether leading to the possible dissolvent of the original idea. Speaking of artistic education, Moritz has studied at Akademie für Photographie in Hamburg, Freie Kunstakademie Arte Fact in Bonn, and “Arte Fact” Bonn Altrichter/Prof. Egelkamp Postgraduate studies Free Art, Master class.

Even after 50 years of creating, Frost is still searching for the ultimate shape, with the concept of making completely unique, dramatic, and visually exciting sculptures being his constant challenge.

Tom Henderson,"British artist Tom Henderson creates artworks that are between sculpture and painting. His geometric image objects have a strong three-dimensional presence that charges the surrounding space. To fully appreciate and experience Henderson's artworks, viewers need to be mobile to see from different angles. The artist has had exhibitions throughout the cities of the UK, US, Europe, and Mexico. His latest exhibitions were in Bethlehem Kirche, Meerbusch, Germany, The Observance Chapel, Draguignan, France, and Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Tamaulipas, Mexico City.   Tom Henderson was born in 1976 in the United Kingdom. He studied at the Eton College with the world-renowned artist Gordon Baldwin, after which he went on to graduate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. There Henderson earned his BFA in fine arts with a major in sculpture. From then on, he started creating artworks that perfectly balance the 2 mediums, painting and sculpture.  The unique artistic expression allowed him to create pieces that are never pictorial in nature, rather architectonic. The surfaces of the artist's paintings are never flat, thus they demand mobility from the audience. To fully accomplish such a visual feast, the artist uses a wide range of mediums, such as spray paint, cast acrylic, automotive paint, and aluminum. Due to their use, Henderson's artworks have a solid industrial presence that strongly reminds one of the Minimalist artists, such as Donald Judd.    Unlike the impersonal qualities of Minimalists who did not wish for the personality of the artist to come through in their works, Henderson aims to engage the viewers and establish a deeply personal connection. Henderson said: The artist often creates series that explore different themes. Through his three-dimensional installations titled Audio Painting, he explores the hidden mysteries of sound. In another series titled Plane Space, Interiors, and Installations, he looks closer at the anomalies that are so often overlooked in Minimalist space. Through the creation of a single visual object, Henderson tries to fully understand, examine and explore the quality of three-dimensional space. This possibility of infinite planes is what is at the heart of his work. Tom Henderson currently lives and works in Provence, France.  ",336

By incorporating various references from popular culture and combining them with personal experiences, she creates surreal, yet powerful monochrome compositions aimed to reflect on different psychological states. Through these striking scenes, Assunta A.A.M. explores pain, death, Memento Mori, and Vanitas ironically and challenges the perception of the beholder again and again. ",338
Glen Rubsamen,"A visual artist and writer, Glen Rubsamen primarily works with painting and photography. Influenced by his life in Los Angeles, his paintings begin as photographs of the urban landscape, which he reassembles into flattened images of palm trees, billboards, power lines, and roadside attractions.  Born in 1957 in Los Angeles, California, Rubsamen lives and works between Los Angeles  and Düsseldorf. He earned his BA and MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1978 and 1981 respectively.

Rubsamen's urban scenes featuring quotidian objects are often set against ambient warm colors of the sunset as well as acidic greens and yellows and dreamy blues. These backdrops are contrasted sharply with the silhouette-like black figures arrayed in the foreground. Portraying a landscape shaped by human hand and transformed by civilization, these works appear like film stills, exuding an air of calm and drama. ",339
Giulia Ricci,"An Italian-born visual artist and art educator, Giulia Ricci draws intricate, disorienting geometrical images utilizing a variety of physical and digital processes.

Receiving a PGCE in art and design in 2009 through a part-time scheme for artists at UCL Institute of Education, Ricci balances a freelance career in teaching with her art practice. Ricci creates finely detailed geometrical abstract work using a variety of hand-made and digital processes, aiming to translate the experience of tactility into a visual image. Drawing always underpins her practice across the various media she employs. Using grids and geometric patterns, she seeks to create a sense of texture. The basic structure of my work consists of grids of isosceles right triangles, arranging, modifying and distorting their configuration using repetition, rotation, mirroring and other compositional methods that are typical of ornaments.

His latest series, titled Emanations, is an attempt to express the spiritual potential of the most essential aspect of photography: light.

Pépin finds inspiration everywhere, in anything, and his extensive travels certainly help in that regard. Although these journeys are the starting point of his exploration, his creative process is far from being premeditated and more often than not begins in the unconscious. The artist is able to distance himself from his subject enough to give it its own consistency through working with contrasts in a kind of controlled chaos, and the results are even more impressive considering that most of his Pépin pieces are painted on large-scale canvases.

Bas Meeuws,"Dutch artist Bas Meeuws uses photography as a basis to breathe new life into the 17th century Dutch and Flemish still-life genre. Self-taught, he draws on his catalog of over 13,000 species to create artworks in the line of Ambrosius Bosschaert or Jan Davidsz de Heem. He orchestrates an extraordinary diversity of flowers, demonstrating the same descriptive precision, enriching the works further with insects or gastropods. For the artist ""the bouquets in the paintings were impossible constructions with flowers from different seasons.""   The neutral background fixates the focus on the foreground, where movement seems to be gushing all around. Meeuws' works require a certain amount of time to be observed properly. If the viewer is too hasty, he will see just the vase with flowers in it. However, upon closer inspection, there is beauty in each flower, but also the reflection of the light from a leaf and the elegant arch of a stem. The artist depicts flowers with different blooming times, and their proportions are strange. Additionally, Bas Meeuws differentiates himself from his predecessors by adding what we consider today as bad seeds or ordinary grass. His goal is not just pure visual pleasure – the works are intended to awaken a broader sense of respect towards everything nature has to offer and remind us of the transience and frailty of life.   To create an artwork, Meeuws draws inspiration and materials from his vast database of individual flowers, all photographed in the same lighting. Always meticulously careful to capture every detail, each plant is digitally shot from multiple angles and positions, so nothing is missed. Over the years, the artist has built an astonishing digital library of various botanical species. In a way, the process is similar to the one utilized by seventeenth-century painters, as often they did not have the means to afford all the flowers for their still life. Thus they took reference from the books where they were drawn in detail.   Unlike the seventeenth-century masters who often depicted tulips, Meeuws does not limit himself when picking the species of flowers. More often than not, a more common variety sneaks in among the conventional kind, including celery, cornflowers, and daisies.   In 2013 the artist had his first solo exhibition at Westfries Museum, Hoorn. Today Meeuws' works are part of numerous public and private collections, including Rijksmuseum Muiderslot in Muiden, Museum of Art and Photography in Bangalore (India), Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands, and Leiden University Library Special Collection of Photography in Leiden. In 2019 the artist published his extensive oeuvre in a book titled Flower pieces: a photographic journey around the world. Bas Meeuws lives and works in the Netherlands. ",348
Yevhen Lisniak,"Ukrainian artist Yevhen Lisniak creates vivid and colorful abstract works marked by a sense of intense emotional energy. His practice is grounded in the search for, and contemplation of, tension between a range of abstract sensations: such as randomness versus the ideal; naiveté versus knowledge; or animal nature versus the superhuman. This tension is visible in the mixture of visual references Lisniak deploys in the work. Some of his paintings incorporate recognizable imagery that places them in the current moment, such as glimpses of home interiors during the time of social isolation, or references to advertising, fashion, cinema, or the work of other contemporary artists. Most of his works, however, are completely abstract. Lisniak employs an intuitive, performative method of painting that incorporates gestural mark making, scraping, and layering of impasto mediums, in the tradition of Abstract Expressionism. He strives to merge colors, shapes, lines and forms in ways that inspire sensations of lightness and beauty, while simultaneously suggesting anxiety and an embrace of the unknown. His work has been exhibited extensively in Ukraine. He lives and works in Lviv.     Featured image: Yevhen Lisniak - portrait. Photo courtesy IdeelArt",349

Paul Fabozzi,"Paul Fabozzi is an American artist whose paintings and works on paper are inspired by his surroundings - shapes, colors, textures, and other sensory inputs. Far from being literal renderings of real places and spaces, these works are a realization situated along an axis between the physical experience of a location and the creative act of transformation. ""My work as an artist is motivated by the desire to articulate new visual approaches to understanding the fundamental connections among navigation, perception, and consciousness."" Navigating cities excite Fabozzi's senses, while the process of painting and drawing allows him to construct a visual language ""that enables me to understand aspects of these encounters that I can then see in existence outside of myself. Inevitably, I internalize my mode of creation, which in turn effects my next set of encounters with the world."" Ultimately, the artist's goal is to make images that ""remind us of our deep need to actively establish visual, tactile, and reflective connections to our physical world."" Paul Fabozzi received his BFA from Alfred University in 1989 and his MFA from the University of Pennsylvania in 1993.

Robert Motherwell,"Considered as one of the most eminent American Abstract Expressionist painters, Robert Motherwell is not just a founder of the New York School, alongside Philip Guston, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko, but has also proved himself as an editor, printmaker, theorists, and a writer. His impulsive and intuitive approach that has been influenced by the Surrealists can be seen in his paintings. Motherwell tries to unravel the deeper meaning of reality, something that is never seen and unrecognizable. Some of his most iconic works are related to the Spanish Civil War, which left quite an impression on the artist. Robert’s desire to explore, allowed him to move from one medium to another, from paintings and prints to sketches, collages, and drawings. His mission is to create substantial and eye-catching art imagery, which will transcend pure emotions, truth, and authentic feelings.   The painter was born in 1915 in Aberdeen, Washington, as the first child of Robert Burns Motherwell II and Margaret Hogan. He grew up in San Francisco, California, where his father worked as the president of the Wells Fargo Bank. The asthmatic problems took him to the Pacific Coast, whose beautiful landscapes, vast spaces, and vivid colors, later became the integral characteristics and elements of his abstract paintings. At the age of 11 Motherwell was awarded a fellowship at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, and unlike many of his peers, he had formal education, which he got by studying painting at the California School of Art. Although Motherwell hoped to become a philosopher, and received a BA in philosophy at the Stanford in 1937, and earned a Ph.D. at the Harvard, life has chosen a different path for him. During 1938 Robert went on a year-long journey to Europe. When he came back he moved to New York, where he decided to study the history of art at the Columbia University, under the famous Meyer Shapiro.    At the Stanford, the artist got into contact with the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, who introduced him to the concept of abstraction. The most valuable lesson that Motherwell learned was how to remove inessential, and show only necessary. The modernist touch in his work comes from reading symbolism and other literature from Mallarmé, James Joyce, Edgar Allan Poe, and Octavio Paz. It was Meyer Shapiro who arranged that Motherwell studies alongside Kurt Seligmann. With his help, Robert got to know Parisian Surrealists like Max Ernst, Duchamp, and Masson. This proved to be a substantial influence in all of his future artworks. In 1941 while going together with Roberto Matta to Mexico by boat, the young artist met Maria, his future wife. Here he made eleven drawings, known as the Mexican Sketchbook. Motherwell showed the fascination with Asian calligraphy, so he used pen and ink to paint Japanese haiku poetry, and to present his interest in Zen.    The method called psychic automatism, or artfull scribbling as Robert Motherwell named it, represents a free movement and wandering of brushes and pens over the surfaces, in which the artist allows the unconscious impulse to have the major role. This approach defines the Abstract Expressionism- putting ‘accidents’, ‘incidents’, materials and textures to be in the foreground. In 1943 Peggy Guggenheim offered him to display his series of collages. This life in a time opportunity was taken immediately, so this American artist incorporated mixed torn paper, violent themes, and expressive paint, in a relation to the Second World War. As a multi-disciplinary artist, he combined different media like collages, prints, and paintings, with diverse techniques such as oil and acrylic paint. Besides this, he introduced lithographic methods and began to use cigarette packets and artists supplies. Throughout his career, Motherwell strived to discover the personal and political meaning of his abstract art.    In 1948 something that began as a small drawing, became maybe the most recognizable legacy of Motherwell. The Elegy to the Spanish Republic series contain over 150 works, including canvases, drawings, prints, studies, and all of them represent artist’s intellectual and emotional involvement with the Mediterranean culture. They commemorate the death and the loss of liberty, as the result of the Civil War that ended by the Spanish Republic defeat in 1939. Parallel to this, the era of enlightened humanism has disappeared with it. Through these paintings, he found black as one of the subjects, and its combination with white evokes the sense of life and death. Another pivotal moment in Robert’s career is immortalized by the Iberia project, titled by the region in Spain. In this case, Motherwell makes a transition from figuration to more pure and symbolic abstraction. To some, they remind of the bull, but they are actually about black, the most present color, and element, from which the work can occur.    Because of his intellect, youth, and energy, Motherwell was considered a leading advocate of the New York School. Robert lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, and was a teacher at the Hunter College, but he also directed the publications of the The Documents of The Modern Art. His writing and editing skills could be seen in essays on art and aesthetics. The author died in 1991 in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since his first solo exhibition in 1939 at the Raymond Duncan Gallery in Paris, his works have been displayed in various cities and museums around the world, such as the Arts Club in Chicago, the San Francisco’s Museum of Art, or the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His exhibitions took place at the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, the Royal Academy, London, and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. ",357
Jim Dine,"Many of those that create art think of their pieces as more than something to be sold or recognized as a success: they’ve spent time making it, instilling it with their own ideas and ways of portrayal, making it personal. For Jim Dine, this statement applies to most of his paintings, as he would make the personal side of his work physical, putting all sorts of items valuable to him into his works. His subjects hold a lot of meaning as well, delving deep into the memory and heart of the artist. Although his work is largely based on Abstract Expressionism and Dada techniques, Dine is one of the now legendary artists that are considered to have started the Pop art movement, making his work monumental.   It didn’t take long for Jim Dine to become popular. Born in 1935 in Cincinnati, Ohio, he received his BFA from Ohio University in 1957 and soon after, he was a part of a series of events that would earn him great acclaim in the art world. Pioneered along with artists Claes Oldenburg and Allan Kaprow, as well as the musician John Cageis, Happenings were a stark contrast to the all-too-known art scene of the late 1950s, drawing much attention wherever they were held. Happenings are described as chaotic performances, and their nonlinear narratives along with the participation of the audience truly fit the description. Yet, they seem to have been exactly the thing that the art world needed at the time and Dine’s The Smiling Workman from 1960 brought him great critical acclaim.  Having Happenings open a lot of doors for the young artist, Jim Dine decided to turn back to painting, creating mixed-media works and assemblages. There was a very particular and special feature in his work, though, that would separate him from his colleagues and attract viewers to his art. In his pieces of the 1960s, he would often attach items of value to the canvas he was working on: be it tools, shoes, pieces of clothing. Personal items of significance to the artist would adorn the painted canvas, giving each of his works a whole new dimension, both physically and otherwise. Not only were the pieces unique to the artist based on the elements he affixed, the narratives themselves were also very personal. Undergoing psychoanalysis in 1962, Dine was very interested in his own mentality, exploring the realms of memories and identity. He would, naturally, express his findings and knowledge through his art, and most artworks bore some sort of memory representation of Dine’s. Over time, a distinct set of subjects was present in his practice including hearts, robes, and palettes, which, heavy in significance to the artist, became a signature mark of his work. By combining the iconic and the personal, Dine managed to imprint a nuance of his individual feelings in the artistic history, preserving his memories in time.   Dine kept creating up until 1962, the year when he truly became famous and entered “the artistic hall of fame.” By participating in the ground-breaking exhibition titled New Painting of Common Objects, Jim Dine became one of the first ever artists to exhibit Pop art in America, along with great names like Andy Warhol, Robert Dowd, Roy Lichtenstein, Phillip Hefferton, Edward Ruscha, Joe Goode, and Wayne Thiebaud. The exhibition took place at the Norton Simon Museum and it is historically important not just because of the birth of Pop art in America, but because of its further influence on modern art. However, Dine’s association with the movement isn’t preferable, given its impersonal and mechanical character that goes against his practice.   There have been several shifts both in his subjects and medium used after the 1960s. During the 1970s, he’s been largely focused on a series of drawings, having sculpture take over in the 1980s. Sculptural work will retain a central place in his practice even to this day, preferring nature theme over man-made objects in his works. Since the second part of the 20th century, Dine has worked in a variety of media ranging from painting, mixed media, and drawing to photography, printmaking, sculptural work and book illustration. In his recent work, he manifests his alter ego that takes on the form of the animated puppet Pinocchio. Dine presented the character in several forms, working on a commercial book, paintings, and sculptures, of which the most recognizable one is the nine-meter high bronze statue from 2008. Titled Walking to Borås, the sculpture of a walking Pinocchio can be found in the city of Borås, Sweden, and it isn’t the only one of its kind; another large bronze sculpture can be found near the entrance of the Cincinnati Art Museum.   Given Jim Dine’s great renown, it comes as no surprise that his work has been the subject of nearly 300 solo exhibitions taking place across the world and can be found in many esteemed collections. Anything but an accomplishment, without a doubt, there might be an even greater achievement behind his memory-infused work: an ageless recollection of items and subjects evoking emotion upon every view, frozen in time. While anyone may look at a Jim Dine painting and see a portrayed heart with a shoe glued to the canvas, one person is reminiscent of days of youth, filled with the feeling of overwhelming joy or sorrow, happiness or pain…  ",358

Brown attended the American Academy of Art in Chicago and eventually enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he received Bachelor of Fine Art and later on his Master of Fine Art. The artist also received the Edward L. Ryerson Traveling Fellowship, which enabled him to travel throughout Europe and Egypt. Alongside painting, Brown expressed himself through printmaking, as well as sculptures of found, assembled, and painted objects, theatre and opera sets, and mosaic murals.

Ghirri is best known for his color images of gardens, monuments, and the studio of Giorgio Morandi. Having great curiosity with scale and illusion, he created works imbued with a dream-like atmosphere. Writing about the meaning behind his works, he emphasized ""a verification of how it is still possible to desire and face a path of knowledge, to be able finally to distinguish the precise identity of man, things, life, from the image of man, things, and life.""",363
Brent Hallard,"Brent Hallard is an American contemporary artist born in Australia in 1957, currently living in San Francisco. His abstract art is minimalistic and exploring monochromatic expression. He also works as a curator and a writer, and he is a professor as well, never adventuring too far away from the world of art.  Hallard received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990 and Master of Arts in 1992 from the University of New South Wales. He teaches at the San Francisco Art Institute and the California College of the Arts. Inspired by spaces and geometrical forms, the artist manipulates both the image and the arrangement of the object, so the observers and their perception could be challenged. He sticks to minimalism, as the forms of a square and rectangle are making his art widely recognizable.  Hallard knowns that the pieces he makes are simple. And he would certainly like it to stay that way. The artworks on paper and aluminum are, in the same time, both challenging and not that much complicated. The idea is to create a sort of language where a lot could be expressed using simpler terms. His artworks have been exhibited throughout the world, and he has curated a number of shows.  He is represented by IdeelArt gallery in London, UK.  All images courtesy of the artist.",364
Peter Soriano,"Sometimes success and recognition aren’t enough. When your work seems predictable, easy or obvious, it’s time to move forward. Peter Soriano was already famous for his sculptures when he started to feel this way. The artworks were defined as childlike and with a pop sensibility, and they took an almost absurd amount of time to be finished. The artist just didn’t find himself in the world of sculpture anymore. The change was a necessity, and it was a radical change indeed. He now works in wall drawings, which he specialize for the exhibitions, and also in drawing on paper, which is much more intimate.   By the mid 90’s, Soriano was famous for his biomorphic and deceptively playful, fiberglass made sculptures. After the residency at the Atelier Calder in France, in 2004, the artist started making wall-based sculptures by combining spray paint with pipes and steel cables. These structural elements were later abandoned, and the artist found his field of work – wall drawings, or murals. The only thing he carried from his past are the abstract elements, but when closer looked, his new creations, consisted of lines, boxes, notations and spray-painted arrows are the artist’s response to his surroundings. He enjoys working in spaces imposed on him, and that makes his exhibiting pieces even better and the constant process of adapting gives them a personal note. In addition to the wall drawings, Soriano also creates on paper, and this line of work is inspired by the same subject matters. He uses watercolor, spray paint, colored inks and pencils to draw on the sheets of Japanese paper, which are then folded over and over again, until the drawings become almost structural. The process includes reworking, and the finished pieces are the result of the constant heightening and repositioning the relationship between forms.   Peter was born in the Philippines and has French-American origins. He was artistically educated from an early age by his uncle, Fernando Zobel, who was famous in the field of abstraction. It was Zobel who insisted that the drawing is the basis of artistic development. Soriano spent hours in museums where he drew human figures and landscapes. It was these teachings of his uncle that led to where he is now. He considers drawing as a vehicle he uses to locate himself in various physical, metaphorical and psychological spaces. The paper is used to show how these places intersect, but also so the artist could clarify and understand them. The artist earned a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1981 and later that year, completed a residency at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.   Making a fresh start isn’t easy. Before leaving for the Calder residency, Soriano gave up the lease on his studio in Williamsburg in which he worked for more than a decade. Much of his unfinished work ended up in the garbage, and the sight of all that work being trashed only made him more determined to use that change in his physical place to change his work to, by force, if necessary. That decision, in combination with the early lessons on drawing led to his new approach to art, and finding a place where he once again enjoys creating. He is represented by the IdeelArt gallery in London, UK.  Featured image courtesy of IdeelArt. All images copyright © Peter Soriano.",365
Jaanika Peerna,"Nowadays, developing your own personal artistic style is not easy. With so many artists trying to be original and unique, a person who even thinks to stand out in such a crowd must bring something new to the table. And their contribution must be grand. The art must be different than what we have already seen,  or risk fading into obscurity, along with all the other similar artworks that are available to the public on every step. The work of Jannika Peerna is one of the better examples of inventing your own individual way of artistic expression - simply because her art is unlike anything we've had a chance to witness for quite some time.   Jaanika Peerna is an Estonian-born artist whose work incorporates drawings, videos, installations and performances. From combining all of the above, she carefully produces abstract drawings. Using video and installation, she emphasizes her work after it's finished, but the performance part comes during the actual work- Peerna draws on paper through spontaneous physical movements inspired by, and reminiscent of, dance. Usually, she does this alone, but sometimes there's an audience witnessing the performance.  Such a complex way of creating and displaying did not come over night. It took Peerna years of education and shaping herself emotionally to become what she is now. After finishing The Tallinn Pedagogical University in Estonia, Jaanika was further educated at the State University of New York and University of Art and Design in Helsinki. These three prestigious schools helped her form an important foundation for her later involvement with art. Obviously finding her inspiration in Post-World War II artists who craved for new ways of making art, Jaanika wanted to express herself in a method that was hers and hers alone. And, after many trials and errors, eventually she managed to achieve such goals.    Essentially, Peerna works on sheets of paper that are either placed on the floor (similar to Pollock's dip & drip as she is as well standing atop of her work material) or attached to the ceiling so that it hangs in front of Jaanika. She then takes a few pencils in each hand and presses them on the sheet of paper, positioning herself in a way that she is able to move around while never breaking contact between the pencils and the surface of the paper. Jaanika then proceeds to move around on - or with - the paper, as if the two of them are taking part in a private dance. Depending on her mood, Jaanika would play different music or sounds and use different sets of pencils when drawing. That way, every dance becomes unique. Sometimes she creates in a group while surrounded with other dancers and singers, but this seldom happens because ideally she prefers to create alone. Ultimately, as she does not have complete control of her work, every piece is a world for itself and it's always done with a lot of improvisation and emotion. Peerna likes to describe her work as a visual memory of the moment. Jaanika's artwork has been noticed and awarded on many occasions, most recently in 2016 at the Foire Internationale du Dessin (International Drawing Fair) in Paris, France, where she won the FID Grand Prize. As for exhibitions, Peerna's drawings have been displayed extensively in New York and Tallinn (her home town), as well as in Berlin, Paris, Helsinki, Rome and multiple other cities.     Jaanika Peerna attempts to record the beauty of a complex environmental and experiential stimulant. Perhaps a little ironical when related with the way her art is created, but she likes to think her creative side enjoys silence, and that, similarly, her artwork is also deeply rooted in an investigation of quietness. This only adds to an already very complex process to understand, and - have no doubt - Jaanika's art is hard to comprehend, which is somewhat strange when gazing upon her work for the first time. In the end, the best way to grasp Jaanika's art is to understand Jaanika herself: I am interested in the never-ending process of becoming with no story, no beginning, no end—just the current moment in flux.   The artist is represented by Ideelart Gallery in London, England.  Featured Image: Jaanika Peerna - Kvelstein Performance - Photo Credits Scribble Blog",366
Greg Beebe,"Miami-based, mixed media artist Greg Beebe found his true calling in the art world when he began creating spontaneous and thought-provoking abstract works of art. Beebe’s earlier mediums of expression also included spray-painting graffiti, cartooning as well as sketching free hand imagery. The self-taught artist, who is also a successful financial entrepreneur approaches his art practice with the same intention as he does his business interests…with an unstoppable impulse to create. The result is honest commentary that promotes the power of positivity and the pursuit of creation in any form. Inspired by pioneering contemporary artists, such as Jackson Pollock, Gerhard Richter and Andy Warhol, Beebe’s unique style brings to life a mixture of abstract expressionism, pop and graffiti art and introduces a multitude of mediums ranging from sculptured objects, cement, iconic photographs, acrylics, spray paints, glitter and glass. With a mind that is driven by diversity, Beebe is always looking for new ways to inspire himself and his followers. Whether it be through subliminal messaging or by his use of intense color combinations, heavy textures or unusual mediums, he looks to bring a piece to vibrant life and often times the message is left for the viewer to find. - Greg Beebe ",367
Invader,"There are many artists that hide their true identity in contemporary times, especially in the domain of street art. The reasons for such an action are varied and though most of them manage to keep their names and characters unknown to the world, their work resonates throughout the streets across the globe. Widely known to the public regardless of his hidden identity, Invader puts up iconic installations in cities around the world based on popular 8-bit video games from the 1970s and 80s. Facing both acceptance and denial by the inhabitants of the places he “invades,” Invader keeps his practice going in the service of the townsfolk, providing artwork that can be seen free of ticket fees.  Born in 1969, the well-known French urban artist grew up playing video games and though many kids of today can relate, the games of the time had a “slightly” different visual form. Made with 8-bit graphics that was common of the era, the games influenced the artist to portray the characters present in them in the suitable form of mosaics, representing each pixel with a tile. More than just the subject of his work, the artist’s pseudonym derives from one such game titled Space Invaders, and the artist often goes as far as to state in interviews that he attended a tiling school on Mars (he, in fact, is a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris). Placing his works across the streets from Hong Kong to New York, he refers to these postings as “invasions” as he installs various 8-bit characters in publicly visible places.   The biggest project that encompasses much of his artistic oeuvre started out back in 1996 and it includes “invasions” of major cities around the world. Much like in the game version of the story, the first wave of invasion included little recognizable aliens and Invader started out with portraying them in his home city in 1998. The invasion quickly spread across 31 other cities across France and since then, a total of 60 cities in 33 different countries have been invaded by his artwork. Seeing himself as a hacker spreading this 8-bit virus, Invader’s work appeared on 6 of the 7 continents publicly displaying iconic video game characters like Pacman, Mario Princess, and of course, the aliens from the Space Invader. However, not everyone is fond of the works Invader puts out on certain locations; his own estimate of the works that have been removed from their placements is about 15% of the early placed works. Whether taken down by building owners, thieves or fans, Invader battles the issue by putting his pieces in less accessible positions, high above the ground. Much to the disappointment of both the artist and city residents, the government would sometimes get involved and remove the pieces from certain public places. Regardless, the testament of Invader’s invasion of the world’s metropolises stands to this day and can be seen in subtle residues of the 8-bit virus steadily spreading from the virtual world into reality.   Hacking into the city property is anything but an easy job to perform. The pieces Invader puts up are placed there illegally and he’s seen the inside of a jail cell more than once. Believing that the galleries and museums are less than accessible to everyone, he accepts the risks that come with the territory and makes the city his canvas, gifting his work to the people. Though we may not know his name or the look of his face, the pixels of the Invader leave a lasting impression on the viewers across the globe, summing up into a pretty picture.

Kenny Scharf,"The artworks of Kenny Scharf, who is a  muralist, painter, sculptor, and installation artist, have been often described as playful, optimistic, bubbly and full of joy.  Scharf, a native of sunny California, is most famous for his highly imaginative large-scale paintings of anthropomorphic creatures. Even though his imagery is colorful and bright, with a child-like appeal, it refers also to darker issues of the modern world. However, these traits of his works are latent, only lurking beneath the  colorful and idyllic surface of his paintings and collages. Scharf has participated in the 1980s East Village Art movement and his major influences are abstract expressionism and surrealism.   Kenny Scharf was born in Los Angeles in the late 50s and he has earned a B.F.A. from the School of Visual Arts in New York, in 1980. Scharf first came to artistic prominence in the early 1980s in New York, along with eminent street artists and muralists Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. He placed his bright imagery, drawn from television and pop culture, on the streets and in nightclubs of the city, helping to nurture a dynamic and freewheeling scene. Compared with the work of Haring and Basquiat, Scharf’s pieces are less chaotic and less emotionally turbulent, but on the other hand more humorous and more heart-warming. It is known that Haring and Scharf were close friends and even roommates for a while, which is the reason they were exposed to similar artistic influenced at NYC scene of the 80s.   Kenny Scharf considers his art as pop surrealism because he draws his inspiration from the realm of unconscious, which is typical for surrealists. The images come from the unconscious except that my unconscious is filled with pop imagery. My unconscious is pop, so therefore, the art would be the pop surrealist, says Scharf about his body of work. He believes it is weird and interesting at the same time that something recognizable to everyone, such as Fred Flintstone, is a personal thing for him. So something that is very personal for one person can also be personal for others because of the world that we live in today, concludes Scharf. It is impressive how prolific and creative Scharf is. During his career that spans over a couple of decades, he  has worked in a variety of traditional media, much as painting, printmaking, drawing and sculpture. At the same time, he also did less traditional and more innovative works, such as designing lifeguard stations, Zippo lighters, watches, cell phones, carpets and carnival carousels. His earliest works from the 70s were mainly humorous collages, while his recent pieces from 2015 and 2016 are mostly murals and installations.   It is evident that Scharf enjoys the world of cartoon characters. He often uses images from the animated cartoons which here popular during his childhood, such as The Flintstones and The Jetsons. Later in his career, in 2011, he also made a humorous depiction of popular snack foods, such as many variations and flavors of donuts. The reason Scharf uses cartoon images in his work is to bring the popular culture into the fine arts. He wants to see how far he can push the line between high and low art. This makes sense because he is originally from LA, which is the cradle of lowbrow movement, but at the same time, he is a classically trained creator. In 2001, Scharf has even released a cartoon of his own, called The Groovenians, which is unfortunately an unfinished project.   Scharf is known as a key figure in the East Village art scene of the 1980s. His shows were held at Fun gallery in 1981 and Tony Shafrazi in 1984, before he started showcasing his pieces in museums, such as the Whitney, which selected him for the 1985 Whitney Biennial. After many successful exhibitions, Scarf became busy with additional projects, such as designing album covers and various interior spaces. For example, he did the album covers of The B-52’s in the mid-80s and he designed a room at the legendary Tunnel nightclub in New York. Because of his friendship with the iconic graffiti celebrity Keith Haring, Scharf has appeared in the documentary called The Universe of Keith Haring. With Haring, who was also his roommate, Scharf has created a blacklight disco installation called The Cosmic Closet,  which was situated in their apartment close to Times Square. This unique project got transformed into its incarnation called The Cosmic Cavern, which is an immersive installation which brings together graffiti, cartoon imagery, and futuristic environments. In 2004, Scharf has also appeared in The Nomi Song, a documentary about the other friend of his, an opera singer and new wave star Klaus Nomi. In 2010, Scharf has initiated new collaborations and started working with artists Joe Grillo and Laura Grant, who belong to an artist collective from Virginia Beach, called Dearraindrop. After his initial success at New York art spaces, he started to have solo and group shows internationally, including the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg and Bienalle de Sao Paolo in Brazil. Some of his most notable solo exhibitions took place at the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Monterrey in Mexico, MoMA PS1 in New York, and the Pasadena Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2015, Scharf had an exhibition in Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, where he has presented his early murals with frenetic energy which reflects their fast-paced creative processes.   Scharf has never abandoned his pastel and neon-tinted worlds of colors – in 2010, he has produced a new series of work, which combines oil and acrylic colors with spray paints. The series is called Naturafutura and it represents an amazing world of swamps, cartoonish oceans, and cosmic jungles with purple palm trees. I don't look at any picture, there's no silkscreen imagery, says Scharf about his inspiration behind this series. However, even though he doesn’t have any clear imagery he relies on as a source of inspiration, he depicts things he always used to like, since his early culture. This means nature, the effect of man on nature, the interconnectedness past and future, and outer-space experiences. Also, many of the lush, tropical places that surround his studio in Bahia in Brazil inspired this work. However, the American artist is still faithful to his old ideas even when portraying a tropical paradise. Despite the overall happiness and idyllic atmosphere of his scenes, there are seahorses, sharks and similar razor-teethed creatures which create a slight menacing effect and leave the viewers perplexed. It is true that most of Scharf’s paintings are celebrating nature, but some of the pieces from this series are also talking about the destruction of nature, which is a very important and overwhelming issue in the nowadays world. In addition to Naturafutura series, in 2010, Scharf has also produced a series of 36 two-by-two-foot paintings of donuts. When asked about the reason behind these works dedicated to the most popular American desert, Scharf has wittily replied: I like this theory that the universe is shaped like a donut. They're just a great image: It's cosmic, it's pop, it's everything I love.   Scharf is an active artist who doesn’t like to take breaks – his main ambition is to maintain the course of work that he has established around 30 years ago. He is creating new paintings, sculptures and murals and organizing performances based on his rich past experiences and knowledge.  His original approach is still  unchanged – he wants to produce the best work possible every time and he aims at reaching out beyond the elitism of fine art. Instead, he wants to keep building an extraordinarily beautiful bridge which connects the popular culture with fine arts. The artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art in Miami.  ",369
Lek,"Lek is a French graffiti artist, a member of Da Mental Vaporz crew, who was lucky to live in Paris in the 80s, when the city cradled many graffiti artists. At the age of 16, Lek realizes that the streets in his neighborhood are covered with graffiti, stencils, and tagging. He was living at a time when French graffiti scene was emerging, near the glorious, mysterious place named Stalingrad. A whole generation of teenagers was identifying to the newly discovered lifestyle and wanted to create, produce, and work with it. In this abundance of different styles, Lek found himself on the initiation grounds, where he discovered and embraced the graffiti culture.   Among many influences, works of Rammellzee and Kase2, Lokiss, Jay one, Skki and Echo, are held in high regards for Lek. At the beginning, the inspiration was mostly drawn from the spray can, which made a focal point in the graffiti art. But this wasn’t the only influence that artists of the time wanted to work under. This group of artists in Paris wanted to find their inspiration elsewhere, so together they buried themselves into pictural competitions so they could build their own identities. Willing to experiment and get out of the traditional, American context of graffiti.    The French graffiti crew Da Mental Vaporz was formed in 1999 in the suburbs of Paris. The collective grew to a surprising combination of styles and individuals who manage to maintain a creative unit, despite or because of their versatile styles and creative natures. The crew is known for their huge murals representing childlike characters, dislocated dolls, and monsters, conveying cynicism with just a perfect dose of innocence. Their colorful world serves well for the ingenious concepts that Lek provides.    The letter being the essential element of graffiti, finds itself pushed away by the Lek, who peels it off, blows it up, and diverts it. Having an architecture background, the artist manages to keep his graphic reflexes and the apprehension of materials and mediums. Understanding the volumes, Lek enchases abandoned buildings, houses, and tunnels, trying to blend them in the environment.    During the 1990s, Lek emancipated himself, infusing his work with all the different influences, from Bauhaus to Futurism. He started off in the streets of Paris, only to leave them for abandoned industrial wastelands, thus becoming one of the pioneers of what we now know as urban exploration. The artist constantly travels across Paris suburbs, searching for new places to enrich with his art. But, Lek isn’t just a graffiti artist, in 2009 he co-wrote a book “Nothing but Letters” with YKO. The book was a visual collection of 20 years of graphic experiments, impacting the graffiti intensely. Lek’s work has been exhibited at the Grand Palais in 2006 and 2009, and in 2014 and 2015 he collaborated with designers such as Agnes B and Kenzo, after which he continued his solo and duo projects with Sowat.  The artist is represented by David Bloch Gallery.  ",370
Paul Jenkins,"Paul Jenkins was a prolific American abstract artist, known for his unusual chance-based, paint-pouring and fate-tempting technique of painting. He is considered as one of the most important figures of New York’s Abstract Expressionism, alongside Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. “I try to paint like a crapshooter throwing dice, utilizing past experience and my knowledge of the odds. It’s a big gamble, and that’s why I love it” – Paul Jenkins  Paul Jenkins was born in 1923 in Kansas City, Missouri. As a teenager, he moved to Youngstown, Ohio. As a boy, Jenkins met both Thomas Hart Benton, an American regionalist painter, and Frank Lloyd Wright, a distinguished architect. A fire that occurred in a city where his great uncle was pastor destroyed a local church, and Frank Lloyd Wright was in charge of building a new one. Accordingly, the young Jenkins met Lloyd Wright, who recommended him to drop art and take up farming. Ironically, many years later Jenkins’ art was exhibited in one of the most famous buildings that Wright designed, the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Jenkins’ talent for art developed through his various interests in visual arts, as well in the theater. Jenkins earned a fellowship to the Cleveland Playhouse, and later he went to the Drama School of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. From 1938 to 1941, Jenkins served an apprenticeship in a ceramics factory at Kansas City Art Institute. He spent weekends there, watching the skillful handling of clay by the masters’ hands. Paul was impressed by how they guided shapes and forms with ease, and this observation later had a profound effect on his ideas about the approach to canvas and painting.  In the following years, Paul Jenkins served in the United States Maritime Service and the US Naval Corps. After his return, he moved to New York in 1948, joining a wave of aspiring painters moving to the Big Apple. Determined to become an artist, Jenkins enrolled into the Art Students League, where he studied under the mentorship of Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Morris Kantor. During the course of his studying, Paul was drawn to several artists, including Jackson Pollock’s captivating dynamics and the metaphysical approach of Mark Tobey. He became associated with the Abstract Expressionists as he met Pollock himself, and befriended artists such as Jean Dubuffet, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning. In a search of different perspectives and influences, Jenkins traveled to Sicily, then Spain, and later to France, which in time became a second home for the rest of his life. Although he resettled in Paris in 1953, Paul’s lifelong connection with New York never quite faded.  In 1977, Paul Jenkins met the photographer, art historian and future wife Suzanne Donnelly. At that time, she was working on an archive material that later became their joint book titled Anatomy of a Cloud. Extensive and highly detailed, the book consisted of 24 tomes and was published in 1983 by Harry N Abrams.  At a peak of his career in the 1970s and 1980s, Jenkins lived a rather glamorous life between his homes in Paris and New York. His works graced a high-fashioned Pierre Cardin boutique in Paris. At one time, the first lady of France Danielle Mitterrand visited his Parisian studio, and Paul decided to throw a party for her, with guests like Paloma Picasso, Robert Motherwell, and Berenice Abbott. Paul Jenkins was very interested in Eastern religions and Jungian philosophy. He was especially drawn to the I Chang, an ancient divination text and the oldest of the Chinese classics, and to the writings of Carl Gustav Jung. These writings had a great influence on aesthetics and artistic approach of Jenkins, highlighted with the artist’s step towards self-reflection and psychoanalysis in his later years. He was also interested in astrology and mysticism – his Upper East Side house was filled with prisms, oriental objects, stones, rocks and found objects that to him were irresistible. His other homes included the one in Paris, and also in St. Paul de Vence, near Nice. The St. Paul de Vence home was actually an industrial building which the artist converted into a studio.  Paul Jenkins’ work is for the technique and location closely associated with New York’s abstract expressionism, although it resembles more closely to Morris Louis’ and Helen Frankenthaler’s visual style. During his stays in France, Jenkins got familiar with the works of Odilon Redon, a 19th-century French symbolist painter. Paul was primarily impressed by Redon’s wildly colored and frenetic backgrounds that seem abstract for the context. As for him, Paul used to describe himself as an “abstract phenomenist”. In 1959, the artist began to entitle all of his artworks with a preface word Phenomena, followed by a key phrase or word that would not allude to any visual form.  “I try to find the identity word that will secure an attitude towards the painting rather than provoke a visual object that the eye will seek out” – Paul Jenkins Paul Jenkins’ paintings are filled with energy, dynamics, and life. Like some force of nature, they light up a space they complement, giving it a special atmosphere and motion. Colors are vivid and playful, vague or unmixed, creating a multi-layered impression of a canvas. Ranging from indigo and aquamarine to bright yellow and orange, with bursts of dark blue and deep green, colors capture the swift disappearance of changing light.  First-ever one-man exhibition of Paul Jenkins’ works was held in Paris in 1954, at the Studio Paul Facchetti. His first US exhibition followed two years later, which took place at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. Soon, more than eighty-five museums located in more than 10 countries followed their example. Since the 1950s, international exhibitions of Jenkins’ works never stopped and continued throughout all of his career, including several significant major retrospectives at the Kestner-Gesellschaft, Hanover, the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Charleroi, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, San Francisco Museum of Art, and the Musée Picasso in Antibes. The organized major retrospectives gave Jenkins’ more exposure in the 1970s. In the same decade, in 1978, his works appeared in Paul Mazursky’s movie titled An Unmarried Woman. The paintings had a starring role as the works done by the main protagonist of the movie, a Manhattan artist played by the actor Alan Bates. Paul Jenkins’s art caught an eye of many collectors throughout the United States and Europe. Nevertheless, the artist had a stronger following in Europe, who with his flowing white hair and beard reminisced of an old-fashioned archetype of the avant-garde artist. The Europeans and especially French art figures loved it. Jenkins’ abstractions are included in numerous private and museum collections worldwide, such as the Museum of Modern Art – MoMA in New York, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Tate Museum in London, National Museum of American Art, Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, among many others. Paul Jenkins continued to paint until his death in 2012. The artist died at the age of 88 in his Manhattan home, after a short illness.  ",371
Harald Kroner,"Harald Kröner is a German artist best known as so called paper artist. He essentially produces works on paper and collages as well as public installations.   Kröner was born in Pforzheim, Germany at the beginning of 60s and in 1984 he started studying at the Kunstakademie Stuttgart under well known painter, illustrator and printmaker Rudolf Schoofs , where he graduated in 1990. Harald Kröner is best known as a notorious collector of paper of any kind (artist paper, printed sheets, or papers collected in his daily life) which serves him to express his art. He usually works thoroughly with paper transforming it into drawings and collages. In this creation process, Kröner normally uses colored ink, stain, lacquer, spray or enamel. Lines are sort of a leitmotif in Kröner’s artworks, whether they are a result of a pencil stroke, the edge of a torn paper, dripping ink, the borders, or a simple cut of collaged paper underneath his paintings. A chance as well is a very important part of his work - Kröner is always in search to explore the limit between hazard and control, order and chaos.  Harald Kröner is curious about perception or the transition that lingers somewhere between the visible and the invisible – in place where the color influences the drawing, where the complex and seemingly strange combination of elements create such harmony that can be felt and observed by the viewer only. Asia with its culture and secrets is a great inspiration for this German artist, the reminiscence of Asian tradition transpires in Kröner’s work through the use of ink that presents spontaneity and freedom living side by side with rigor and concision. Another inexhaustible source of afflatus for Kröner found in languages, fonts and literature and it can be seen mainly in his public installations.  Harald Kröner is presented by his work in various German public collections as well as international private collections in Germany, Switzerland, France, Australia and USA. He has widely and mainly exhibited in Germany in solo and group exhibitions, and has also taken part to various art fairs including Drawing Now in Paris and the Korean International Art Fair. Kröner is represented by IdeelArt since July 2015.  All images copyright © the artist",372
JMR,"James JM Rizzi is a New York-based street artist. His signature style of mixing the established art and street art in the form of neo-abstract expressionist works is what sets him apart. Born in Brooklyn, NY in 1975, JMR came into contact both with street art and established art world early on in life, and was influenced by them from then on. He graduated from the New York School of Visual Arts in 1997. Setting as his goal the convergence of the two styles that hold sway over him, JMR creates renderings of early abstract expressionists’ ideas in his own view.  Even though JMR’s style is not new in itself, what draws a line between him and other artists is his choice of color, the finesse that characterizes his work, and his movement and the tone of his work that has been compared to that of Murakami. What fascinates art collectors, as well, is the line of progress apparent in his work that serves as a road map of his development as an artist.  JMR had participated in 11 Spring St Show in 2006 and in The Underbelly project in 2010, which established him as an artist. Since then, he has created building sized murals in New York and made installations for Nike. His works were exhibited with those of great artists such as Banksy, Swoon and Basquiat, among others, and published in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The London Times and Elle Japan.   He is represented by Woodward Gallery in New York.  All images copyright © the artist",373
Johan Creten,"A Flemish sculptor, Johan Creten is considered one of the precursors – with Thomas Schütte and Lucio Fontana - in introducing ceramics in contemporary art. Fascinated by its beauty, its symbolic impact and the richness of its history, the artist explores the medium through multiple techniques and scales. His painting training brings another dimension to his sculpture work, giving the glaze and its colors a main role in the artworks. Born in Sint-Truiden, Belgium, Creten became fascinated by art, literature and music from an early age and he he met a couple of passionate antiquarians in his hometown that supported him during the first years of his life. In 1985, he graduated at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Ghent where he discovered a clay studio, left behind by the students. Initially trained as a painter, he began to include ceramics elements in his paintings and familiarized with mud. He graduated at the School of Fine Arts in Paris. In 2009, he was nominated for the Flemish Culture Prize. Choosing to work with clay, the artist sought to open the possibility of this rare technique in the contemporary art field, turning it into material with a serious artistic aura and limitless new possibilities. His colorfully glazed, edgy ceramic works take on all manner of forms and are riddled with imperfections and complex interrelationships and meaning. ",374
Jean Feinberg,"Jean Feinberg is an American contemporary artist currently living in New York. She is well known for blurring the borders between 2D and 3D, as she combines painting with sculpture, with the emphasis on the painting process. She began to exhibit her work at the women’s gallery A.I.R. and Mary Boon Gallery, and had since exhibited throughout the United States.  She received her BS from Skidmore College in 1970, and her MA from Hunter College of the City University of New York, in 1974. The abstract art was chosen because of the flexibility and the powers of suggestion it posses. She is inspired by her surroundings, and her favorite place is Hudson Valley in upstate New York, where the lights and colors play in a specific manner. Also, the colors and everything joyful and wonderful in them, as well as the weather and landscape light are the constant sources of inspiration.  Although her work can be described as constructions, Feinberg consider painting to be much more significant part than sculpture. The reason is that the artist wants for these pieces to be viewed from the front end, rather than from all angles, like in the sculpture. Often she paints on pieces of used wood, and makes decisions about composition based on the colors she chooses, and the materials which are incorporated in her artworks.  She is represented by IdeelArt gallery in London, UK.  All images courtesy of the artist.",375

John Henderson,"An American painter, John Henderson creates works that revolve around the use of copper electrotype, raw patina, and dye sublimation on polyester. Through his practice, he expands and develops an engagement with abstract painting and its conditions. Born in 1984 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, Henderson lives and works in Chicago, Illinois, USA. He graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois and Northwestern University, Illinois. He exhibited worldwide, including Perrotin in New York, Paris and Hong Kong, Proyectos Monclova in Mexico and T293 in Rome, among others. Henderson uses a wide range of technologies and techniques, from molds, castings and digital printing to video and photography. Reforming, revising, and reproducing the manual painterly expression, his works invoke Minimalism and Abstract Expressionism while acknowledging a distance from their unmediated practice. As he explained, he is interested ""in a rather outdated conception of the painterly gesture, or the ""artist's touch"", as a kind of signifier of originality."" While the originals are very much present in the final works, there is a certain loss of information inherent to the translation. His works are assembled through a conceptual framework of best-guesses, suppositions, estimations, and reversals. ",378
Chryssa,"Chryssa Vardea-Mavromichali was a recognized Greek-American artist noted for her neon, steel, aluminum and acrylic glass installations. ",379
Tilman,"Tilman is a German artist whose comprehensive body of work includes painterly pieces, constructed environments and layered wall and floor-based objects. Regardless of the chosen medium in which he works, this author regularly relies on an abstract minimalistic language, leaving as much room as possible to the interpretations of the individual viewer. His technique investigates the ways of seeing and precepting, encouraging the observer to indulge in the fantasy of what may be beyond the surface of the piece. Besides working on his artistic creations, Tilman is also active as a curator. It should also be noted that Tilman is a founder and present curatorial advisor of Dolceacqua Arte Contemporanea (D.A.C.) in Italy, as well as a patron of Contemporary Non-Objective Art (CCNOA) in Brussels, Belgium.   Tilman acquired his artistic education by studying at the Munich University of Applied Sciences and Design where he graduated in the year of 1978. Additionally, he also studied under Günter Fruhtrunk and Hans Baschang at the Munich Academy of Visual Art where he spent the years between 1981 and 1985. Such experiences have provided Tilman with an incredible control over his artistic vocabulary, a feature that served him extremely well in the long run. As it was already mentioned in the opening sentence, his work has an incredible range as Tilman has been tirelessly creating various aesthetic objects over the years. He authored countless paintings, drawings, prints, three-dimensional wall hangings, floor-wall objects and built environments, all of which enjoyed success on the art market. Tilman's paintings, which can be interpreted as his ground-zero medium as it features most of this author's characteristics, incorporate various materials including paint, lacquer and crayons, as well as rely on numerous kinds of surfaces including vellum, MDF and aluminum. Tilman's three-dimensional wall hangings are also created upon MDF and aluminum surfaces. These pieces are mostly based on a concept of providing a primary frontal plane while also creating new spatial possibilities beyond that primary level. Interestingly, Tilman's vellum pieces offer similar visual arrangements of space as their compositions of color and form interact with light and have a tendency of re-ordering the visual environment. Tilman has exhibited extensively both in the solo and group exhibitions held across the galleries of Europe, Asia, Australia and the United States.    Unsurprisingly, Tilman finds most of his inspiration within the concepts of Concrete Art and Minimalism. His pieces may use a seemingly simple vocabulary, but they are very effective at seeding curiosity within the minds of the audience, encouraging them to seek forms, compositions, colors and other sensory impressions. Via such a concept, Tilman allows for the elements of his pieces to take on a new, non-objective presence. This author's visual language does tend to get quite complex on a conceptual level, despite having a rather simplistic way of composing.  This artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",380
Suzanne Caporael,"An American artist, Suzanne Caporael is a painter whose elusive imagery - ranging from refined figuration to color-field abstraction - derives from her methodical, persistent observation of the natural world. She is primarily interested in the collection and recollection of individual experience, and the way in which the brain processes visual information. Born in Brooklyn, NY in 1949, Caporael earned her Bachelors and Masters degrees from the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, CA. She had her first show at thirty-five, when then Director Paul Schimmel debuted her work at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. She has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the San Francisco Art Institute. Her work is held in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Carnegie Museum of Art, and the High Museum of Art. Ranging from refined figuration to color-field abstraction, Caporael's paintings are drawn from the collection and recollection of individual experience. Sensuous and lyrical as well as rigorously formal, these works are a combination of the aesthetic and the conceptual. Combining observation and research, she has created different bodies of work related to trees, chemical elements, water, ice, time and place memory. ",381
Audrey Stone,"Audrey Stone is an artist whose subtle and bold aesthetics explores the differences between texture and the materials as well as the tension between genders in the society. She uses ink, graphite, and thread to create an array of colorful angular art pieces that captivate in their simplicity. Audrey Stone is fascinated by geometrical forms but also finds the time to explore the deep symbolism that both colors and materials have for people all over the globe.   Audrey Stone knew she wanted to be an artist since she was at school. She got her BFA at Pratt Institute where she also sold her first painting, after which she got her MFA from Hunter College, in New York. In 2007 she began a new art series and created an array of paper works by applying thread, ink, and pencil onto a grid format. It's difficult to make a distinction between the different materials at first but upon closer inspection, it becomes noticeable that certain lines are drawn in pencil and ink while other are sewn into the paper. While inspecting her artworks the viewers can get the idea that the drawn lines are a two-dimensional representation of the thread or the other way around. Later own she began using angles and random patterns thus developing her work further.   The creation of sewn paintings represents a new stage in Audrey Stones career. Fascination with color and line remained but the painter turned away from paper and began working on canvas and linen. Also, her work became more colorful and complex. Audrey Stone began to use thread as a way of inserting color and a sense of the third dimension to her pieces, thus adding a sculptural element to her work. Thread has a deeply symbolic meaning. For centuries thread was used by women as a mean of production. Even today thread is deeply connected with female crafts. Thread has the ability to repair, decorate and keep pieces together. Paint, on the other hand, comes from patriarchal lineage. Paint is easier to use, apply and manipulate. By combining the two,patriarchal and female materials, Audrey Stone question omnipresent gender tensions present in every society.  ,  Audrey Stone paintings contain many layers that are quick to confront the viewer with numerous changes in the surface. First layer of paint usually soaks right through the canvas but slowly, as the artwork progresses linen and canvas base gets covered in layers of paint that transform rough fabric into a smooth surface. Audrey Stone uses tape to control the movement of the paint which enables her to create edges in her abstract work, something that has been her fascination since the early days. There a lot of symbolism in the color itself. Every individual sees color in a different way but yet there are some common conceptions people share about each individual color. For example, blue can symbolize the sky or the ocean, red can symbolize blood and black death. Audrey Stone uses a rich color palette to portray emotions and create contrast thus adding a human touch to her abstract artworks. Audrey Stone is represented by IdeelArt.

Brad Wilson,"Brad Wilson is an American artist who became widely acclaimed for his photographic series Affinity, which features studio portraits of wild animals. His professional career began in New York City over 20 years ago where he worked as a commercial portrait photographer for magazines, book publishers, and design firms. In 2010, after feeling like much of his photography was becoming too routine and predictable, Brad Wilson stopped working with human subjects and started a new fine-art project with animals in the studio.  The resulting series of images, entitled Affinity, immediately transcended the normal boundaries of wildlife or nature photography, and moved provocatively into a new realm of animal portraiture. Brad Wilson’s powerful photographs represent a world that we, as humans, rarely inhabit – a world of instinct, intuition, and present moment awareness – a fully natural world, distinct from the increasingly urbanized and computerized modern landscape that surrounds us. Brad Wilson pulls us into this world with large, exquisitely detailed photographs, offering up a compelling feeling of intimacy and proximity seldom experienced. He intentionally removes all barriers and distractions so the animals depicted move vividly forward out of a deep black background to thoroughly reveal themselves and to challenge our notion of what it means to be human.  Brad Wilson has an obvious respect for the animals he photographs and says,   Indeed, the Affinity series makes it clear that we share our world with incredible creatures, as unique and complex as we are, and that we have an inherent interest in protecting them. However, the photographs achieve more than a mere awakening of our environmental consciousness. There is something else clearly visible in the intensely sharp eyes of these animals, something that echoes our own evolution. As we continue to develop a new human world, even more, detached from the natural landscape around us, we create a pronounced feeling of isolation and separation. The photographs of Affinity remind us of quite the opposite - we are not alone, we are not separate, we are part of a beautifully rich and interconnected biodiversity of life. Brad’s work has been widely published and exhibited around the world, and featured recently by Audubon, Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, Vogue Italia, Paris Match, Vanity Fair Italy, CNN.

Beat Zoderer,"Beat Zoderer is a Swiss sculptor and architect who predominantly uses everyday materials as a basis for his work. Sourcing his materials from general hardware stores, he makes use of them within what at first appears to be methodical structures based on repetition or mathematical systems. However, each of these pieces allow for an arbitrary element. Born in Zürich 1955, Zoderer currently lives and works in Wettingen and Genova. He exhibited in a range of venues, including Neues Museum Nürnberg, Germany, von Bartha, Basel, Switzerland, Taubert Contemporary, Berlin Germany, Bartha Contemporary, London, UK, Galerie Conrads, Düsseldorf, Germany, Galerie Michael Sturm, Stuttgart, Germany, Dominik Mersch Gallery, Sydney, Australia, Museum Chasa Jaura, Valchava, Switzerland, Museum Chasa Jaura, Valchava, Galerie Martenson & Persson, Stockholm, Villa Langmatt, Baden, Germany and Haus Konstruktiv, Zurich, Switzerland. Working through a very spontaneous process, Zoderer draws on the formal language of historic works of geometric abstraction. His works can be described as self-contradicting and ambiguous, but also playful. ",384
Jill Moser,"Jill Moser is an American abstract artist whose work explores the intersection of “painting, writing and the animated image.” Moser earned her B.A. from Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, in 1978, and her M.F.A. from Hunter College, New York, in 1981. She has been awarded a New York Foundation for the Arts Painting Fellowship and a Max Beckmann Scholarship in Painting from the Brooklyn Museum. She has taught at Princeton, Virginia Commonwealth University, and several other prestigious institutions.  Moser has an interdisciplinary practice that includes painting, printmaking, drawing and collage. Her printmaking includes a diverse array of techniques, such as lithograph, etching, monoprint, intaglio, and screen printing. Her work can be understood in relation to the history of written language—marks that carry meaning. Her brush marks are lyrical, gestural and calligraphic. The lines and forms at first appear spontaneous, yet they evolve through a methodical, indexical process. Moser constructs her compositions in terms of figures on a ground. The surfaces are layered and textured, creating a sense that the lines, marks and figures are suspended in dimensional space. Color and tone add emotional and visual weight to the work, creating pictures that are at the same time self-referential, revelatory of the process of their making, and open to the interpretation of viewers.  Moser is inspired by languages, whether written, visual, indexical, or gestural. She seeks balance similar to that sought by a poet—between conveying enough meaning that the viewer has a guided revelatory experience, and allowing enough room for surprise during the creation and presentation of the work that additional layers of meaning can emerge. She also finds inspiration in such things as the language of filmmaking, the history of symbology, and the collaborative process, for example inviting writers to contribute texts that Moser then interprets into abstract visual compositions.  In their article about Moser on romanovgrave.com, Fintan Boyle and Jennie Nichols wrote,   Moser has exhibited extensively around the world, including at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts Houston. Her work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum, and many others. She lives and works in New York City. ",385
Yvonne Thomas,"The American painter Yvonne Thomas is best known for her lyrical and sophisticated abstractions, prized for their interrogations into the symbolic possibilities of color. Her works consisted of soft, curvilinear brushings harmonized into a pictorial lyricism. Born in Nice in 1913, Thomas immigrated to the United States in 1925 and studied at The Cooper Union, and the Art Students League. She also attended the Subject of the Artist school, with other famous Abstract Expressionist artists such as Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, William Baziotes and David Hare. After becoming a member of the Artist's Club, she exhibited in the 9th Street Art Exhibition in 1951. Thomas' works evolved from early Cubist structures into increasingly expressive compositions. After a three-artist show at Tanager Gallery in 1954, in which Thomas was included, Stuart Preston described her as an artist who distilled “non-specific emotional moods in a language of restless brushwork and fitful color.” Her works were characterized by wide brush-strokes and sweeps of color, forming a personal, fresh, clear and uncomplicated lyricism. The issues she addressed and the zeitgeist of her art gave Thomas a central role in the avant-garde movement that she embraced. ",386
Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler,"Life partners and an artistic duo, Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler are known for site-specific installations and objects concerned with mapping trajectories, questioning history, and highlighting the specificity of places and communities. They have been working together from the late 1970s until Ericson's death in 1995. Born in 1956 in Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, Ziegler began his undergraduate studies at the Rhode Island School of Design, later transferring to the Kansas City Art Institute. He earned an MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia in 1982. He lives and works in Nashville, Tennessee, where he is the current chair of the Department of Art at Vanderbilt University. Born in Manhattan in 1955, Ericson earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1978 and a master's from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982.  The couple met as undergraduates and began working together in 1978, developing a style that featured provocative accumulations of materials and ideas, many of them involved with architecture, American history and the economy. Through their practice, they synthesized conceptual, land art, and interventionist strategies, often working directly with local iconography, sites, and communities across America. ",387
Daniel Rich,"A German contemporary artist, Daniel Rich is known for translating photographs into paintings that call attention to implicit political and social narratives transcribed in the built environment devoid of human presence.  Born in 1977 in Ulm, Germany, Rich currently lives and works in Berlin. He received his Bachelor of Fine Art degree in 2001 at the Atlanta College of Art in Atlanta, GA. He received his Master of Fine Art degree in 2004 at Tufts University in Medford, MA and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, MA. He also studied at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, ME in 2004. He exhibited worldwide, including venues such as Miles McEnery Gallery, New York, NY; Peter Blum Gallery, New York, NY; Carbon 12, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA; Horton Gallery, New York, NY; Andrew Rafacz Gallery, Chicago, IL; Perry Rubenstein Gallery, New York, NY; and SUNDAY, New York, NY. Representing architectural images, the artist seeks to introduce a dialogue about changing political power structures, failed utopias, the impacts of ideological struggles, war and natural upheavals. He explores the highly symbolic role architecture plays in politics and the way it reflects our contemporary experience. ",388
David Allan Peters,"The American artist David Allan Peters is best known for abstract paintings that explode with vibrant colors. Drawing inspiration from the saturated sunsets and flora of his native California, he combines painting with sculptural hand-carved qualities. Born in 1969 in Cupertino, Peters currently lives and works in Los Angeles. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the San Francisco Art Institute in San Francisco, CA, and his Master of Fine Arts degree from Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, CA. His work has exhibited in a range of venues, including Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA, AKA PDX, Portland, OR, Chandra Cerrito Contemporary, Oakland, CA, Marc Arranaga Contemporary Art, New York, NY, and Ruth Bachofner Gallery, Santa Monica, CA. Working on wooden panels, Peters covers the surface with numerous monochromatic layers of paint. Once these layers have dried, he cuts, scrapes, and carves into them, releasing all the colors in the form of radiating lines, rings, and whorls. The variance and choice of color, comes from the specific depth he chooses to carve. The artist describes this tedious process of addition and subtraction as hiding secrets and rediscovering them again. These rainbow pigment scraps are later transformed into vibrant sculptures of geometric shapes and crystalline forms. ",389
Flavio Garciandia,"One of Cuba's leading and most influential artists, Flavio Garciandía is regarded as one of the fathers of Central and South American conceptual art. A key figure on the vibrant Cuban art scene of the late 1970s and 1980s, he is a co-founder of the Havana Biennal. Born in 1954 in Caibarién, Cuba, Garciandía currently lives and works in Mexico. He has had several gallery and museum exhibitions including, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, Australia, Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, FL, Winnipeg Art Gallery, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Katonah Museum of Art, Katonah, NY, Lowe Art Museum, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, Walker Art Center and at the Mai 36 Galerie. Some of his works are a part of the Museo de Bellas Artes collection in Havana, Cuba. Uniting a range of postmodern styles, from cubism to conceptualism and abstract expressionism, Garciandía's works indirectly adapt and reflect Cuban culture as a fusion of diverse influences and terms of references, but also the history of modern art. He ironically describes his style as New Tropical Abstraction, referencing the meteorological term Tropical Depression, which refers to a group of thunderstorms under a closed cloud cover. ",390

Miriam Smidt,"Born in Ostfriesland (East Frisia), a barren, windy region of Germany, close to the North Sea with its unique, tides-related and widely known Wadden Sea, Miriam Smidt always felt drawn to the water. Just as she was drawn to art, daring not to give herself to it for more than a decade – until she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016. This brutal revelation hit her like the mightiest of the storms, making her give up on her work as a social scientist and an author to walk the path of art. Her work is fluid but doesn’t achieve that state through chemical products such as solvents, resins, and binders. Instead, Smidt, repelled by the artificiality of the chemicals but fascinated by the viscosity of the paint, invented a method of fluid painting that includes watercolor inks and paste, naming it liquid light painting. The paste dries invisibly, leaving the colors to shine themselves, with even the paper shining through colors. By observing every single of her works, one can track the effects of ebb and flow, follow the emotions and erosions. Smidt's titles, frequently accompanied by an ironic wink, refer to the struggle for a balance between a life with limitations and the unconditional will to break cages and chains. At its core, her art is about the in(ability) to control – there is no way to control and direct the liquids on the paper, or anything else in the world. “You try to compose an artpiece - a life / curriculum vitae / your memoirs and everything runs like water through your fingers.”     Smidt’s work shows moments of energy and dynamism, where the image can be altered with one swipe of the hand, once again drawing parallels with real life, which can suddenly change with one fateful swipe. There are undeniable heavy and grim facts of life and the artist has no other answer but to oppose them with levity – using the watercolor and brightness, perfectly describing her work motto – “Water(color) – the source of life.” Featured image: Miriam Smidt – portrait.

Lucinda Burgess,"A British contemporary sculptor, Lucinda Burgess emphasizes transience in her practice - the constantly changing nature of materials and the viewer’s direct experience. Working with wood, steel, paper, liquid, and glass, she puts them through the same process repeatedly, highlighting the infinite variety, unpredictability and lack of control. Burgess trained as a painter in the 1980s at Bath Academy of Art in Corsham and, after gaining a post-grad qualification in art teaching at Goldsmiths, she combined painting with teaching. She then became involved with oriental philosophy, and spent time studying in a monastic setting and lecturing on the subject. After working as a successful landscape designer for a while, she has resumed her fine art practice since 2010. In 2014, she gained a distinction in the Masters in Fine Art course at Bath School of Art and Design. Burgess' practice is inspired by her varied experience. The natural processes of change, which often involve the ongoing maintenance required of a gardener, are integral to her pieces, while oriental philosophy drives her thinking. Her famous series Borderlines features works which are neither drawing nor sculpture, highlighting humankind’s inability to define, pin down and fix amidst this constant flow of life.

Ludovic Dervillez,"Ludovic Dervillez is a French abstract painter whose work explores the amalgamation of spontaneity, materiality, and emotion through a visual display of color and dynamic gesture. Driven by rhythm, energy and improvisation, he paints on several canvases simultaneously, moving from one to another. Although a goal, the completion of work is not his primary concern. Instead, Dervillez focuses on experience, immersion in the work, intuition, and the learning process. In 1995, the artist graduated from the Superior School of Art and Design of Reims, where subsequently, from 1997 until 2005, he was also an art teacher.

Paul Landauer,"Paul Landauer is an Austrian abstract painter whose work results from pictorial gestures that create marks, touches, and graphic traces on the canvas. His artistic practice employs a highly personal painting style, often characterized by the systematic and orderly juxtaposition of intense touches. Aside from using traditional media, such as oil or acrylic on canvas, the artist constantly experiments with external textural elements, such as essential jute fabric or precious golden leaf. Even with a methodical process and controlled approach, Landauer's paintings are full of freedom – undoubtedly the result of his moving to Belgrade. ""In Austria you preserve, in Serbia I feel the freedom to question and define - it's a place of inspiration, which invites to expose."" Before devoting his entire time to painting, he worked in movie directing, photography, as a creative director and consultant for brand communication, using his broad skills in visual communication to tell his own personal stories.

Andreas Leikauf,"Andreas Leikauf is an Austrian artist whose painterly practice is based on intertextuality and referentiality. By combining various references from the broader field of popular culture (film, fashion, music, and lifestyle) with simple, yet bold and witty messages, Leikauf constructs seemingly banal narratives aimed to dissect codes of contemporary visual culture. The dim atmosphere of his paintings achieved with a monochrome palette is reminiscent of Film Noir, Pop Art and New Wave. Throughout the years his works were shown in numerous solo and collective exhibitions at important European galleries and museums. ",400

Oswaldo Goeldi,"A Brazilian artist and renowned engraver, Oswaldo Goeldi is considered a master of the art of expressionist xylography – the art of engraving on wood. Working with woodcut and lithography, he achieved somber expressiveness with morbid themes. Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1895, Goeldi lived in Belém, in the state Pará, until he was 6 years old. His father, Swiss naturalist Émil Goeldi, was based there as director of the Museu de História Natural e Etnografia do Pará (now the Emílio Goeldi Museum). After returning with his family to Switzerland In 1910, he started his studies in Bern, and later in Zurich. After serving for a brief period in the army during the First World War, Goeldi moved to Geneva, where he was accepted at the École des Arts et Métiers. Frustrated with the academic environment, he abandoned the school in 1917 and began studying with artists Serge Pahnke and Henri van Muyden, and later with Hermann Kümmerly, with whom he learned lithography. After returning to Rio de Janeiro in 1919, he began a career of engraver and illustrator for popular magazines. Becoming attached to a group of vanguardist artists and intellectuals, such as Beatrix Reynal, Aníbal Machado, Otto Maria Carpeaux, Manuel Bandeira, Álvaro Moreyra, Ronald de Carvalho, Emiliano Di Cavalcanti and Rachel de Queiroz, he started working intensely as an artist. After being poorly received by the critics, he isolated himself in the city of Niterói where he supported himself as a well known illustrator for book editions and magazines.  Goeldi's work impresses by the breadth and depth of the questions he presents. In the artist’s own words, ""the phenomena of nature excite me – thunderstorms, windstorms, heavy clouds, sky and sea, sun and torrential rain and nights full of mystery, birds and bugs. The dramas of the human soul consume me. I feel good about the simple ones and sometimes I get confused with them."" ",402

Tunku Khalsom,"Born in Johor, Malaysia, to a Malay Father and a British Mother, Tunku Khalsom grew up in Kuala Lumpur with her three brothers. She moved to the UK when she was 17, spending the next eight years living in London and then Brighton, where she attended University, studying Interior Architecture and graduating in 2006. After living in the UK, she went back to Kuala Lumpur for a couple of years before moving to Singapore in 2010. Khalsom’s background in Interior Architecture, where she designed hotels and resorts, has helped her understand spaces as a whole, and concerning her art, it has also helped her learn composition and balance. Now she creates abstract paintings, which exude fluidity and stunning color while embracing the concepts of life, love, and change. These paintings contain layered abstract backgrounds, figurative elements, geometric shapes, saturated and neon colors. Skulls and butterflies are the recurring motifs in her work: “As we already know, butterflies are a symbol of change, of metamorphosis, and combined with the skull you’ve got life, death, change and love, all the things that we experience in life.” Khalsom is inspired by Nat Bowen, Sue Arrowsmith, and of course, Damien Hirst. Her pieces are included in private collections around the world – in Singapore, Malaysia, London, USA, Brunei, Australia, and Greece.     ",406
Jennyfer Stratman,"Jennyfer Stratman is an American contemporary artist who transforms her experience and interpretation of the world into the visual language of sculpture, creating pieces rich with emotion, content, and form. Expressed primarily through figuration and natural elements, her work is a continued exploration of interconnections between everything from the subatomic to the galactic. She studied at Arizona State University, majoring in visual arts and art education. Having entered her studies as a ceramicist, she gradually expanded the scale of her creations, eventually meeting the material limitations of working with clay. That’s what led her to the university foundry, and she graduated in 1997 as an emerging metal sculptor.

Zhu Ming,"Zhu Ming is a Chinese artist known for his performances and photographs, which depict the artist inside of a highly symbolic transparent balloon. Whether representing a return to a primordial state, an escape from the rigid social conformity, or a contemporary Vanitas, his works are infused with various layers of significance. Born in Hunan Province, Ming’s idea of the bubble was derived from his experiences of washing clothes by hand, a daily practice that started when he was nine years old. The foam, made up of clusters of tiny, individual bubbles, nurtured his inspiration. Dealing with vulnerability, his oeuvre is distinguished by great conceptual concision and often restricted to closed environments. Ming explores the concepts of isolation and vulnerability, which speak of the explicit and implicit pain that results from both external and internal forces - forces that are socially and intuitionally oppressive, and psychologically driven. He has participated in several pivotal group exhibitions and performances, including at the Guggenheim Museum (NYC), the Tate Modern (London), and The Victoria & Albert Museum (London), becoming one of the most inspiring performers from China. Since 1993, Zhu Ming is based in Beijing.   ",409
Mattia Bosco,"Mattia Bosco is an Italian contemporary artist working in clay, metal, and wood, but is arguably best known for his stone sculptures. Born into a family of artists, he developed his own personal reflections concerning artistic creativity and aesthetics during his Classical studies, particularly in the area of philosophy. Originally working in clay, Bosco found the material welcoming his every gesture, though in a thoroughly permeable and passive manner. Stone, on the other hand, offered a form of resistance, responding to his every move, allowing him to initiate a genuine, formal dialogue with the material. He occasionally integrates color or other materials into his stone sculptures, such as stainless steel. While heavily focused on stone, he still works in ceramic and wood, exploring the potential offered by different materials. Whatever his sculptures are made of, Mattia Bosco seeks to create a synthesis between concept and form. The two combine with balance and harmony, bringing his unique, abstract sculptures to life.

Sebastiaan Knot,"The photographic artworks of Sebastiaan Knot are perceptive investigations. They use light as an explorative and constructive tool, examining forms, colors, and their spatial relationships. Each shot is unique and creates a vibrant sense of depth. Living and working in Rotterdam, Knot is a visual artist with a solid background as a photographer and graphic designer. His artistic practice originates in the studio, where he captures staged compositions of simple shapes, illuminating them with lamps of different colors. Through this process -a skillful use of lenses and filters- Knot questions what he sees: he creates optical phenomena of lights and shadows, chromatic contrasts, and images that look like impalpable architectural structures. There is no digital manipulation; most works are unique pieces or part of a limited-edition series, creating a special viewing experience. Sebastiaan Knot exhibited in the Netherlands and internationally, becoming part of public and private art collections. In July 2022, he exhibited at the Vasarely Foundation in France, weaving a fruitful dialogue with the iconic artworks of Victor Vasarely and showing the same experimental attitude of Optical and Kinetic Art masters. Knot's geometric abstraction challenges our conventional way of observing reality, shedding light on the elementary mechanisms that underlie our visual perception.

Yaacov Agam,"For more than five decades the matters of perception occupied the work of Yaacov Agam and made him one of the most influential artists of modern times. From the very start of his artistic career, the artist has rejected conventional art approach and media in a favor of conducting a  methodology reminiscent to the legacy of avant-garde movements. Agam’s idea to extend the viewer's perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement was governed by the desire for more participation which was in accordance with the times of then art and society currents.   Yaacov Agam was born as Yaakov Gibstein in Rishon LeZion, then Mandate Palestine. His is born in a  family and received no formal schooling, but was inclined in religious practice since his father was a rabbi and a kabbalist, which largely reflected on his later practice. Agam studied at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, before moving to Zürich in 1949. Then, he assigned to study at the Kunstgewerbe Schule where his lecturers were legendary artist’s Johannes Itten and Max Bill both affiliated with Bauhaus movement. In 1951 Agam went to Paris where his career started developing rapidly.   Although during that time Paris was still recuperating from the effects of WWII, the art life already became consolidated. Among the city’s most important galleries was a Galerie Craven which was a hot spot for burgeoning artists at the time. In 1953,  Agam’s first solo exhibition was organized there and immediately he became noticed. After only two years, the gallerist Denise Rene, who showed modern art masters such as Max Ernst and Francis Picabia, organized the iconic exhibition Le Mouvement in 1955. The idea was to introduce the blossoming movement of kinetic art and gathered the group of artists from Jean Tinguely, over Alexander Calder, Victor Vasarely, many others, and among them Yaacov Agam.     The very choice of plunging into the abstract is, without the doubt, related to his family background fulfilled with ascetics and the study of Hebrew mysticism known as Kabbalah. Agam’s nonrepresentational style is an integration of formalist art, but with a particular focus on the matters of perception respectively optical illusion in accordance with the movement. Such a concept was rather radical from conventional mimesis since the observer is able to interact by manually transforming the work or by physically passing by and hence change the meaning, angle or the context of the artwork.    As it was already mentioned, one of the Agam’s lecturers was Johannes Itten, painter, writer, and theorist. He was perhaps one of the most prolific Bauhaus teachers since his methods were based on contemplation, ascetics and physical exercises. Much of his theoretical work was dedicated to the basics of material characteristics, composition, and color, which reflected greatly on Agam. Besides that and the fact the artist basically was a prodigy in regards to forming his personal style without any references from Western art history, the influence of Duchamp’s concept of ready-made is rather notable.   During the course of years, Agam has been working in a variety of media, including painting in two and three-dimensions, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, stained glass, serigraphy, lithography, etching, and combinations of media. Nevertheless, in 1953 he introduced the creation of the  Agamograph, which somehow made his whole activity even more recognizable. It was an experiment which consisted of a multiple series of images viewed through a lenticular lens that changes at every angle viewed. Actually, That how Agam introduced time as another factor to consider in the process of creation.    One of the most important features of Agam’s work is the color.  The palate he uses is very vivid, brilliant and varied in all his creations. The choice of colors is related with Jew religion since Yaacov Agam considers the rainbow as the first gift from God to mankind. In Hebrew, the name of Jehovah is Mehaveh Ou-Mitzvah, which means constant change. Such a synthgma is extended by the element of time, so the whole system and methodology of his is rather complex and interconnected.    From the 60’s onwards, Agam started receiving commissions for works in public space. Among the most famous are probably the fountains at the La Défense district in Paris and the installation titled symbolically  Fire and Water Fountain in the Dizengoff Square in Tel Aviv. In 2009 Agam created a monument for the World Games in Kaohsiung, Taiwan titled Peaceful Communication with the World. It is a colossal object constructed out of pillars positioned in diamond or square formation and their sides are painted in different patterns and hues. The other known work of his a notable, world’s largest Hanukkah Menorah light installation in New York City. The object consists out of real oil lamps, which are lighted every year during Hanukkah.   Without any doubt, Yaacov Agam is an innovator and reasonably his works are part of Museum of Modern Art and the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum as well as a great number of public and private collections around the globe. The artist is the subject of two documentary films Possibilities of Agam and Agam and... by American filmmaker Warren Forma.  Not only that the artist proclaimed the new concept of art as no longer permanent, inaccessible and still, but was eager to achieve a different kind of communication with the public in regards to a silent exchange of energy, experiences, and sensations. As Yaacov Agam proposed in his artist statement his intention was to create a work of art which would transcend the visible, which cannot be perceived except in stages, with the understanding that it is a partial revelation and not the perpetuation of the existing. The outstanding activity, extremely precise and heterogeneous concept and immense efforts of conjoining art and science into a new form made Yaacov Agam as one of the world’s most important artists of the 20th century.

Victor Vasarely,"Victor Vasarely was an eminent Hungarian painter, best known as a father and founder of Op Art movement. His unbelievably complex and colorful patterns engage the viewer’s eye and convey a sense of kinetic energy across the two-dimensional surface. During the 1960’s and 70’s, Victor Vasarely’s optical images became a new indispensable part of the popular culture. They made a strong impact on architecture, computer science, and even fashion. Despite the fact that Vasarely has achieved a worldwide success, he remained quite modest and insisted on keeping his art accessible to everyone. His main motto was Art for All. [caption id=""attachment_291337"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Victor Vasarely - Vega - image via media.mutualart.com[/caption]  Vasarely’s life and biography were quite exciting and full of unexpected choices. The artist was born in 1906 in Pecs, Hungary and he was initially quite passionate about natural science, especially medicine. Accordingly, he decided to dedicate himself to medicine studies at the Budapest University. However, in the late 1920s, he suddenly changed his mind and abandoned medicine in order to start learning traditional academic painting. Around the same time, he enrolled at the private Podolini-Volkmann Academy. In 1928, he became a regular visitor of Sándor Bortnyik's workshop and gallery, which was the very center of Bauhaus movement in Vasarely's home country. While spending time at this gallery, Vasarely got interested in the work of Wassily Kandinsky. He also felt that his home country might not be the most stimulative environment for a young artist, so he moved to Paris and settled there in 1930. He supported himself financially by his work in the field of graphic arts, such as poster designing. He also used to collaborate with various advertising agencies, as a creative consultant. Already at this early point of his career, Vasarely showed enviable skills when it comes to combining patterns and organic images. He preferred working alone and his interactions with other artists were quite limited in this period.  [caption id=""attachment_291336"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Victor Vasarely - Torony II (Left) / Tizenne II, 1986 (Right) - images via pinterest.com[/caption]  Vasarely’slegendary work from the 30s, entitled Zebra, is nowadays considered as one of the earliest examples of op art. It was also a really important departure point in Vasarely’s development of his own style. Over the next thirty years, the artist has created his very own style, consisting of geometric abstract art based on a minimal number of forms and colors. Earlier Vasarely’s pieces revolved around the concepts of color theory but in the 1950s and 1960s, his work became more independent because it started focusing on the optical potential of the two-dimensional view. The artist was also puzzled by the internal geometry present in the natural, organic world and many of his common motifs are rooted in these natural sources of geometry. Since Vasarely’s art turned out to be quite successful in the financial sense as well, the artist has used his income to establish a socio-cultural foundation in Aix-en-Provence in France. The main goal of this institution was the integration of beauty at all levels of the urban environment.  [caption id=""attachment_291339"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Victor Vasarely - Zebra, 1938 - image via charlotteformosa.com[/caption]  Victor Vasarely’s oeuvre consists of paintings and sculptures based on the principles of optical illusions. Over the three decades, the artist has produced a number of quite different series, which confirms the strength and versatility of his talent. Starting from the late 20s until the mid-40s, Vasarely experimented with textural effects, perspective, shadow and light. His most famous works from this period are Zebras from 1937, Chess Board from 1935, and Girl-power from 1934. This period was followed by Victor Vasarely’s further experimentation with cubistic, futuristic, expressionistic, and surrealistic paintings, made in the mid-40s. Afterward, he suddenly felt he on the wrong track, but in spite of this he exhibited his pieces in the gallery of Denise René in 1946 and the gallery René Breteau in 1947. However, it wasn’t until the 50s that Vasarely has developed his very own style. The names and ideas behind his works produced in this period came from various geographic locations. Denfert is inspired by the white tiled walls of one of the metro stations in Paris, while Gordes/Crystal is related to the cubic shape of houses close to the Cote d’Azur. Based on the imagery from his Gordes series, the artist started developing his trademark kinematic images. These were made on acrylic glass panes and due to their modern and light structure, they suggested a dynamic atmosphere. When it comes to his black and white paintings, Vasarely used to combine the frames into a single pane by transposing photos in two colors. During the mid-50s, Vasarely made some of his best pieces, such as his famous Tribute to Malevitch, which is a large ceramic wall placed at the University of Caracas in Venezuela. This beautiful masterpiece was co-designed with the architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva. Generally speaking, around the same time kinetic art became really popular and it truly flourished thanks to Vasarely but also his fellow artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray. In order to thoroughly explain his innovative artistic approach, Victor Vasarely has written and published his Yellow Manifest. This writing was based on his research of constructivist and Bauhaus pioneers. Vasarely clarified that his term visual kinetics refers to the perception of the viewer since the viewer is also the perceiver of optical illusions. After he published this manifesto, Vasarely dedicated himself to another series of works, called Folklore Planétaire, Permutations and Serial Art. This series is typical for its usage of unités plastiques – these are various permutations of geometric forms. In this interesting, almost scientifically organized series, Vasarely has worked with a clearly limited palette. For instance, three shades of red, three shades of greens, two violets and two yellows, but he also restricted his choice of shapes – he used just three circles, two squares, two rhomboids, two rectangles, one triangle, and so forth. Finally, in 1965, Victor Vasarely completed another major series, called Vega: The Tribute to the Hexagon. This series consists of numberless transformations of colors and shapes. Vega has received a great public recognition and was included in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Responsive Eye. The most common optical illusion used in this series is the illusion of volume created by the use of swelling grids.   In 1970, Vasarely has opened a museum containing over 500 of his works , in a beautiful palace in Gordes. Unfortunately, the museum got closed in 1996. The artist came to another similar idea and it was to open the Foundation Vasarely in Aix-en-Provence. This project was inaugurated in 1976 by Georges Pompidou, but nowadays it is also abandoned, due to water leakage from the ceiling. When it comes to other Vasarely’s public projects, in 1976 his large-scale kinematic pieces called Georges Pompidou was installed in the Centre Pompidou in Paris. During the same decade, Vasarely showed a strong interest in the industrial design and he collaborated on the production of an upscale Suomi tableware. In 1982, Vasarely’s work was still quite popular and more than 150 of his unique serigraphs were taken into space by the French-Soviet spacecraft Salyut 7. Later, the same cosmic pieces were sold for the benefit of UNESCO. Around the end of the 80s, the second Vasarely museum was opened, this time in the artist’s native Budapest. Vasarely died in 1997 in Paris when he was 90 years old.   Victor Vasarely’s contribution to the world of contemporary art is indispensable – his kinetic visual experiments had enough power to transformed flat surfaces into dynamic realms of endless possibilities. Thanks to his bold and pioneering approach, Vasarely had bookmarked an entire era in the history of art. In a way, he was also an early bid when it comes to programming, the Internet and digital arts. Nowadays Vasarely is represented by major international museums and galleries and he has received many artistic and honorary awards. Among these important distinctions are the French Legion of Honor, the Guggenheim Prize, and the Gold Medal of the Triennale in Milan. The artist is represented by Galerie Thalberg in Zurich, Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art in Miami and The Jane Kahan Gallery in New York. Victor Vasarely lived and worked in France. ",415
Eduardo Paolozzi,"Enchanted by modern machines and the rapid development of technology, Eduardo Paolozzi produced graphic art, collages, pottery, films, mosaics and sculptures. Mainly driven by industrial engineering, this prolific and inventive Scottish artist was a prominent member of the international Pop Art movement. His early practice of making bronze sculptures representing anguished figures eventually evolved into a process of making geometric human forms by piecing together aluminum and brass casting molds. Paolozzi's mature sculptures have often been described as totems of the technological age.[1]  Eduardo Luigi Paolozzi was born on the 7th of March in the year of 1924, in Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland. He was an only child in a family of Italian descent. In 1943, young Paolozzi enrolled at the Edinburgh College of Art with the intention of becoming a commercial artist and using his creativity to make a living. Although he was slowed down a bit by his short stint in the Royal Pioneer Corps, he transferred to the London's St. Martin's School of Art in 1944 and graduated by the following year at this prestigious UK institution. When the World War II came to a halt and the rifles became silent around the Old Continent, Luigi Paolozzi changed his career path and begun studying sculpture at the Slade School of Fine Art.[2] He stayed there until the year of 1947 when Paolozzi completed his course at this institution.   During the late 1940s, Paolozzi spent some time in Paris, France. Whilst there, he was watching and studying the works of many local surrealist artists[3], such as Jean Dubuffet and Alberto Giacometti. During this time, Paolozzi also started making sculptures and collages - these pieces uniquely combined the influences of Surrealism and Cubism with elements of popular culture and contemporary machinery. By the year of 1952, the pieces Paolozzi made in Paris and their unique style established this artist as one of the creative inventors of what will soon be known as Pop Art.  [caption id=""attachment_368719"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Eduardo Paolozzi - Barkcloth - Image via calsfieldnotes.com[/caption]  During the 1950s, Paolozzi's primary artistic focus was the suffering human form. In the next decade, he further incorporated the theme of modern machinery into his art, a feature that was already responsible for putting this artist on the map of modern art. Aluminum became Paolozzi's new material of choice as he littered his work with discarded machine parts. This was an interesting new feature in his work as it linked him to the early avant-garde art and ready-made pieces. Through his industrial art, Eduardo Paolozzi aimed at making a social statement about man's role in the age of growing technology. Later in his life, this author spent much of his time working on abstract art[4], exploring printmaking techniques and reliefs. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Paolozzi continued to accept public commissions on a regular basis, working on artworks like his 10-foot bronze statue of Sir Isaac Newton. Eduardo Paolozzi died after a long period of illness in 2005.   Thanks to his incredible works of art that attempted to bridge the gap between the rapid development of technology and artistic traditions, Eduardo Paolozzi established himself as a prominent member of the international Pop Art. He was also one of the most unique and distinctive authors of the movement, which is saying a lot since Pop Art was so diverse and rich with characteristic artists. Maybe the greatest of Paolozzi's achievements was his embrace of technology - rather than perceiving it as a sort of demon to be feared, Eduardo insisted that 20th-century art and culture must not reject the results of the industrial development but rather use it and creatively profit from such a correlation.

Fred Stichnoth,"Fred Stichnoth entered the world of professional photography in 1987, when he was hired as an assistant to the famous German photographer Walter Schels. The 1990's saw Fred enjoying success as a portrait photographer, photographing the likes of director Wim Wenders; Thaddeus Ropac in his Austrian castle for Vogue; an exuberant Chrissie Hynde from The Pretenders for EMI Records; Pink Floyd in Berlin; and numerous album covers for many artists and bands.  During the mid-nineties, Fred became enamored with fashion photography. His photos were used in high fashion editorials for magazines and catalogues for a plethora of brands. The German-born, Bali-based photographer relinquished life as a celebrity and fashion photographer in the late nineties, where he was poised for popularity, in order to decamp to the East Indies - a home that is fast disappearing, along with their customs, legends, ceremony and regalia.  Stichnoth’s portraiture studies the beauty of women and ethnic culture using a unique combination borne out of necessity and unconscious influence. He employs an old-fashioned technique whereby a backdrop is used to separate the subject from their surroundings. This juxtaposition is striking when the subject is so obviously separated from their natural environment. He also uses motifs and poses that echo the stylised productions in fashion magazines. The final picture comes together like an ethereal sculpture, caught on photographic paper. ",419

Takashi Murakami,"There is no light without the dark, no life without death, no yin without the yang. One completes the other, and often the two sides of the coin aren’t mutually exclusive. There’s a lot of such duality in art as well: ancient and contemporary, East and West, high and low… To have a clear distinction of the line between such realms is one of the basic principles of the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami who learns from both aspects of any given subject and sometimes merges them together in his work. Titled as the Japanese Andy Warhol, he deals with Japanese aesthetics and cultural criticism in his cartoony paintings, bringing together commercial and fine art.   Comparisons to Andy Warhol have defined the career of Takashi Murakami who has been frequently described, since emerging in the 1990s, as Asia’s counterpart of the US pop artist, using much of the same fusion of the commercial and fine art in his colorful pieces.  And, like Warhol, Takashi Murakami also works with teams of assistants to complete large works. The comparison has brought both merits and difficulties to the Japanese artist, and he’s learned to accept and embrace the connection with Warhol that was bestowed upon him. He does have a certain amount of reserve and states that ""I’m very sad to be compared with Warhol and The Factory, because I have no drugs, you know. We have no drug culture in Japan!"" Takashi Murakami was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. He attended T.U.A Tokyo University of the Arts (formerly the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), and although his original plan was to master the skills necessary for becoming an animator, he eventually majored in Nihonga, which is the “traditional” style of Japanese painting that incorporating techniques, subjects, and styles that are native to Japan.   Due to the mass popularity of anime and manga, Japanese styles of animation and comic graphic stories, he became disillusioned with Nihonga and became fixated on Otaku culture, which he felt was more representative of modern-day Japanese life. The University of Tokyo recently introduced an undergraduate course on Otaku culture; Otaku is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, most commonly those absorbed by anime and manga. Otaku subculture is at the center of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research, and its birth in the 1980s came with the growing popularity of anime and the change occurring in the social perception of Otaku traits. Takashi Murakami achieved great recognition for Otaku-like designs: building on the Otaku fascination with game and anime characters, his studio has produced larger than life fiberglass figurines that exhibit the fetishism of the cosplay culture, where kids dress up as their favorite characters, and the sexualization of manga images. For example, Hiropon, the pornographic fiberglass creation is an anime-type character with monstrously huge lactating breasts that are spilling out of her bikini. This super-sized fantasy figurine sold at an auction in 2002 for $427,500 and helped transform Takashi Murakami into a globally recognized art-world rock star. ""I became an otaku when I was in high school and absorbed many different things from anime, like its erotic and fantasy elements... that very process resulted in that work,"", he says, adding that his art is about finding his true self.   In 2000, he developed and exhibited a signature two-dimensional style he called Superflat. This distinctive style employs highly refined traditional Japanese painting techniques to depict a super-charged mix of Pop, animé and Otaku content, displaying both cultural inspirations and aesthetic issues all within the dimension of the narrative. The style is characterized by flat planes of color and graphic images that portray a design obviously originating from anime and manga. The Superflat movement propelled Takashi to fame in the 1990s and eventually caught the eye of the designer Marc Jacobs. In 2002, Jacobs, as creative director of Louis Vuitton, collaborated with Murakami to update the traditional LV logo. The handbag collection became a defining accessory of the decade. Superflat is also the name of a 2001 art exhibition curated by Takashi Murakami, one that toured West Hollywood, Minneapolis, and Seattle. Superflat is used by Murakami to refer to various flattened forms in Japanese graphic art, animation, pop and fine arts, as well as the ""shallow emptiness of Japanese consumer society."" With enough audience supporting it, the successful niche marketing made Superflat into an art movement, and though it was designed for Western audiences, it has been embraced by American artists who have created their own version of the phenomenon and called it SoFlo Superflat. Artists whose artwork is regarded as Superflat include Chiho Aoshima, Mahomi Kunikata, Sayuri Michima, Yoshitomo Nara, Aya Takano and Takashi Murakami, among others. Murakami’s definition of Superflat comes in very broad terms which allow for the subject matter to be diverse and encompass a variety of themes. Often, the works explore the consumerism and sexual fetishism that is prevalent in post-war Japan and includes lolicon art which is, in return, parodied by works such as those by Henmaru Machino. The variety comes from an exploration of Otaku sexuality through grotesque and/or distorted images; other works are more concerned with a fear of growing up, and some works focus on the basic form, underlying desires that comprise Otaku and overall post-war Japan. Initially, Murakami’s aim was not to make his works as fine-art media but decided instead to focus on the market sustainability of art and promote himself first overseas. This marks the birth of KaiKai Kiki, LLC.   In 1996, Takashi Murakami founded the Hiropon factory in Tokyo which later evolved into Kaikai Kiki, a corporation that deals with art production and art management. The company does more than promote the works of its founder: Kaikai Kiki works as a nurturing environment for new, fresh talent, supporting young, emerging artists. Kaikai Kiki evolved from an art production and promotion company into a collaborative vehicle for like-minded artists. The public exposure and conjoint exhibitions with Murakami have definitely aided the artists that are just beginning their careers, making Kaikai Kiki an ideal and desirable place to start such a path. Although Murakami supervises the work’s production, he never actively paints or sculpts the final work. Striving towards the “God-like” craftsmanship skills of Duchamp, Warhol, and Van Gogh, Murakami imposes certain requirements not only on himself and his training, but on those that seek to become members of Kaikai Kiki. A madness of a sort, one that permeates the reality of these legendary artists that have entered a realm beyond the human capabilities, he seeks to reach this level of visual quality and demands it in the works of others. With a thriving business already set up, the company also does mass production of various products that feature Murakami’s signature images: vinyl figurines, plush toys, keychains, t-shirts, posters, and much more.   With a strong belief that an artist should realize and study the boundaries between different worlds, he has represented a bridge between many of the oppositions like the high and the low, the ancient and the modern. Through his work, Murakami portrayed these contradictions in East and West, past and present, high art and low culture, all the while maintaining accessibility and interest in his pieces. Using his knowledge of Western art, he integrated the Eastern culture within the Western frame and successfully created a revolution in the world of art. Although he had moved on to the art of animation for its popularity, this portrayal of contradictions between the contemporary Japanese and American societies marked his early sculptural work during the beginning of the 1990s.   In 1993, Takashi Murakami created and alter ego under the name of Mr. DOB, serving as a sort of a self-portrait. Mr. DOB is described to have a circular head with two ears, with the letter D inscribed on his left ear and the letter B on the right ear, with the face being O-shaped, thus inscribing his name in its form. DOB is a contraction of the dada-like phrase, “Dobojite dobojite” standing for “Why? Why?” which derives from the comic book Inakappe Taisho. The character of Mr. DOB was supposed to be iconic, authentically representing the Japanese culture while having a universal appeal. This alter ego of Murakami’s is capturing elements of both Japanese and American animation; DOB - who underwent a transformation over time, having his appearances in various pieces becoming darker and more menacing - became a cult hit and presented Takashi Murakami as a name belonging to more than just the gallery circuit.   His 2014 psychedelic exhibit In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow, held in Gagosian Gallery, borrows freely from the past and displays ancient art and architecture in Murakami's signature opposition, a high-low, cross-cultural aesthetic of Superflat. With its allusions to the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear meltdown, this exhibition as a whole puts to the forefront the ways in which religion and art try to define inexplicable calamities that occur. Murakami began examining Japanese artworks which were created in the wake of natural disasters throughout Japan’s history: “To me, religions are a narrative… Natural catastrophes, earthquakes, are things caused by nature. Such chaos is natural, but we have to make sense of it somehow, and so we had to invent these stories.” Following the Great Tohoku Earthquake of 2011, Murakami created a series of works on the subject, many of which were exhibited in this show. The show's most striking piece, Bakuramon, simulates a legendary gate that once led to the capital city of Heian-kyo (modern-day Kyoto) in the 10th century Japan. Placed at the sight of a viewer turning the corner inside the Gagosian Gallery to enter the show, the gate uses wood and stone, and rises nearly to the rafters. The original gate was known as Rashomon, and it served as the setting for the short story underpinning the famous Akira Kurosawa movie of the same name. The version that Murakami made evokes an entrance to another world, as it displays a skull that grins through the gate, marked by the bright colors distinct for the Otaku society. Rashomon was destroyed twice by storms, and it served as dumping grounds for bodies during the famine of the 12th century. In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow presented also gargantuan canvases leafed in gold and platinum: Murakami’s work is driven by his vision of an authentic Japanese identity rising phoenix-like from the authenticity of anime and manga. In other words, he harbors nationalistic sentiments uncomfortably close to those that propelled Japan into World War II.   In 2015, portraits of the Barcelona striker Lionel Messi by Takashi Murakami have been commissioned as part of the “1 in 11” campaign, a collaboration between Unicef, FC Barcelona Foundation and Reach Out To Asia to extend educational opportunities to marginalized children in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nepal. The artworks were auctioned at Sotheby’s in London with the goal to raise funds for the charity. Messi, a three-time winner of the Golden Boot award and a Unicef goodwill ambassador, is a figurehead for “1 in 11” and is leading the efforts to raise awareness and money for the charity. Murakami said the Messi portrait, in which the footballer’s image is superimposed on the artist’s signature comic-book-style flowered background, was part of his ongoing series of portraits of cultural figures of our era.  Jellyfish Eyes is a debut feature film by Takashi Murakami, a loving homage to Japanese popular culture. It is the first in a trilogy of feature films directed and produced by Takashi Murakami, debuted in April of 2013 at Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and it has screened at museums and cinemas throughout the world. Jellyfish Eyes is a story about a young child who discovers himself through an unusual friendship. The live-action feature-film of Takashi Murakami brings the acclaimed visual artist’s trademark aesthetic to a live-action world; elementary-school years may not have looked like this, but all that imagination and moments of wonder feel familiar all the same.   Takashi Murakami’s art is some of the most wanted in the world at the start of the 21st century, and for a good reason: he broke the barriers imposed by cultures, demonstrating how his distinctly Japanese works can find a place in any international domain. An intriguing person as much as an artist, the TIME’s one of the 100 most influential people in the world from 2008 breeds lotus plants, small guppies, and beetles in his spare time. With his mind set on reaching the level of the legends of art history, Murakami strives forward in his work and leads young talents on the path of success with him.  ",421
Yayoi Kusama,"With her portfolio consisting of works from the mediums of painting, sculpture, film and performance, Yayoi Kusama is a famous provocative avant-garde artist from Japan and one of the most prominent figures in her country's contemporary culture. Born in 1929, her career has lasted for decades now and during that time, she established a trademark out of repeating motifs and psychedelic colors that imply on the themes of feminism, obsession, sex, aggression, psychology and powerful self-reflection. Kusama represents an artistic legend that stands as a real leader in the both avant-garde and post avant-garde movements.  As was mentioned before, Yayoi Kusama was born in 1929. She grew up in the Matsumoto City, a mountain town on Japan’s main island, Honshu, known for its Matsumoto Castle - a 16th-century stronghold nicknamed Crow Castle because of its distinguishing black walls. The young Yayoi started painting at an early age of 10, searching for an emotional channel to help her deal with a hard childhood full of neglect and abuse by her mother. By her own admission, the artist even had hallucinogenic visions during those stressful years. So, in an attempt to somehow deal with the harsh circumstances of life, Kusama began painting the aforementioned visions - the pieces consisted of dots and patterns she as a child saw all around her. It was feared that these apparitions were early signs of a serious mental illness, but as Kusama was growing up the symptoms started to gradually disappear. Ultimately, the visions were defined as an attempt of the mind to deal with neglect and isolation. These fruits of fantasy and the paintings they inspired were the basis for Kusama's profession in the years to come. During the year of 1957, Kusama was inspired by the letter from the famous artist Georgia O’Keefe and decided she would go to the United States with intentions of following in her friend's artistic footsteps.  Yayoi Kusama - Accumulation, 1963  Yayoi Kusama arrived in the Big Apple at the age of 27. She already considered herself to be a unique artist, but she was suddenly caught in a society much more dynamic and generally different from Matsumoto City - so even though Yayoi knew she was in the right place it was still a rather stressful experience. She brought to New York that characteristic rejection of traditional art values and after some time managed to become a part of the strong artistic scene at the time when New York was arguably the second city in the world when it came to the avant-garde art, just behind Paris. Over the next decade, she garnered a reputation as a controversial member of the New York art society. She obsessively worked on her series of Infinity Nets, paintings and sculptures featuring meticulous, seemingly endless repetitive motifs. During these first ten years in the Big Apple, Yayoi Kusama also staged elaborate happenings throughout the city - most notably when she broke in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art and performed a happening alongside several of her naked assistance. She organized outlandish performance pieces in prominent spots like Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge, often designed to protest the Vietnam War - the ultimate enemy of the art at the time.     When she managed to establish a name of an avant-garde and progressive artist, Yayoi Kusama became one of the prominent female figures of the New York scene. She exhibited her work with the likes of Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg, directing the way modern art was going. She was enormously productive but did not profit financially from her work - something that never troubled the artist too much. At the peak of her career, however, Kusama started to feel yet again mentally unstable. Not wanting to stay in an American hospital, Yayoi decided to head back home and seek help in Japan that offered a much calmer place for healing. She spent the early 1970s in a mental institution where she wrote surreal short stories and poems. At one point she started to feel better and returned to the physically more challenging mediums of painting, sculpture and installations - but did not ever leave the hospital grounds. It has been recorded that Kusama created rooms in her ward full of mirrors reflecting her iconic polka dots and Infinity Nets. Nevertheless, she continued to have mental breakdowns and was often suicidal.  Yayoi Kusama - Polka dots  After the artist started to feel better psychologically, she decided it was the right time for her to return to the top of the artistic scene where she belongs. As the public often loves a good comeback story, the audience welcomed her back with opened arms. She made many of her fine works in the 90s, but most notably she represented her country at the Venice Biennale in 1993 where Kusama received heightened recognitions from the international art world. Her mature works continued to share the characteristic obsession with repetition, patterns and accumulations - that is when she came up with a term of the obsessive artist, a title well deserved in every aspect. Kusama proceeded to work on her trademarks by covering surfaces - walls, floors, canvases, household objects and even naked assistants - with the already famous and unique dots. However, it should be noted that the artist was never able to get a grip of herself psychologically and never stoped seeking help from mental institutions.    Although she is now in her late eighties, Yayoi Kusama is still very active and continues to prove her reputation as the arguably most important modern artist of Japan. In recent years, she has created large public sculptures on commission and has made several films and documentaries, the most recent released in 2008. The same year, Kusama became the best-selling living female artist, with works breaking record prices at auctions. She continued to create pieces of art richly infused with autobiographical, psychological and sexual content. During this time, Yayoi also published a few novels and poem collections, as well as heavily influencing the fashion scene of the world. Unfortunately, she is still troubled by her mental state and even to this day she lives in a hospital in Tokyo - a hard choice she made a long time ago. Kusama once stated: If it were not for art, I would have killed myself a long time ago. Yet another example of how fate likes to toy with the most brilliant of us all. In October 2006, Yayoi Kusama became the first Japanese woman to receive the Praemium Imperiale, one of Japan’s most prestigious prizes for internationally recognized artists.  Yayoi Kusama - The Flower  Ultimately, there aren't many contemporary female artists whose name precedes them as much as is the case with Yayoi Kusama. She did not only help push modern art down the direction of progress and advancement but also proved that it is possible to mix attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art and abstract expressionism without endangering any one style. Whether you choose to attribute her success to the artistic talent, her bravery or childhood hallucinations, there is no denying that Yayoi Kusama is one of the most era-defining artists of her generation - not the mention that her work is probably the most instantly recognizable of all the pieces in recent history. All in all, a true legend of Japanese art.

Gunther Forg,"Günther Förg, was a prolific German artist. He was a painter, graphic designer, sculptor and photographer born in Füssen, Allgäuon in 1952. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and twenty years later he taught at the Staatliche Hochschule für Gestaltungin Karlsruhe. Since 1999, he was a professor in Munich. His works also include a lot of architectural photographs, which are geometrical and abstract. The main motif of these photos is Bauhaus. Gunther was deeply immersed in the realm of modernism, which his works often exemplify or even toy with. Some of his early pieces are nearly exclusively black monochrome paintings, some of which were exhibited in his first solo exhibition at  Rüdiger Schöttle Gallery, in Munich. These paintings had a milky, veiled effect, thanks to the acrylic black paint combined with translucent gray.   Some of the artists that influenced Günther’s abstract style are Cy Twombly and Ellsworth Kelly. In 1977, after his colleague Blinky Palermo had passed away, Thomas turned to minimal art. This phase was followed by some of his prominent works in the early 1980s. His work Alubilder, from the early 1980s, was assembled of aluminum sheets, with linear patterns painted on them. It was at this time that Förg was using photography for his art, mostly large formats of a variety of famous architectural sites. His interest in photography led him to travel a lot around Europe, with a keen interest for Bauhaus buildings. The grainy quality of his photograph conveys his preoccupation in the process of fragmentation making it a modern style. This effect was to suggest a similarity with paintings. His sharp-angled perspectives on some of the Bauhaus structures in Israel, of fascist ones in Italy, serve to suggest the nature of those buildings. To present his photographs, he used thick protective glass which reflected the room and the viewer.   This German artist's series Fenster-Aquarelle (window watercolors) preceded the Gitterbilder (grid paintings) which appear in his work from 1992. The prior series is the crossbar that forms a grid for space in the image, providing the frame for a flow of paintings, not limiting their free display and development. His pieces play with the architectural structure, just like the one Förg did for the opening of Museum für Moderne Kunst, in Frankfurt, in 1991. This wall piece with a bronze relief formed a contrast to the post-modern museum architecture. In 2000, Förg handled color design for the interiors in the 1920s Villa Bodmer, in Zurich. Here, he installed two immense tubes made of raw metal in the entrance hall.    The title of one of the artist’s exhibitions - What others take for granted is a problem for us – could easily be taken for his credo. He borrowed the idea from an Austrian composer Ernst Krenek. As Förg always played on the edge of conservative and radical, always leaving the viewer, and even his friends in suspense not knowing what really lies beneath. He has built a number of libraries, practically identical, in his studios and apartments in Switzerland and Germany. One of them, in Weidinger, a beautiful structure, with a 4-meter ceiling is also the exhibition space and the guest house of his Foundation. Günther Förg died on his birthday in 2013, from cancer.

Ellen Priest,"Ellen Priest is an American abstract painter, whose art is inspired by jazz music. As a painter, she is mainly self-taught.  Born in 1951, Ellen Priest got her B.A. degree from the Lawrence University, Wisconsin. In 1977, Priest received her Master of Divinity from the Yale University Divinity School in New Haven, with a dual qualification in Christianity and the Visual Arts.  Jazz music has been Priest’s subject matter since 1990. Inspiration for her abstractions comes from several different sources – primary, Ellen is captivated by the rhythmic and harmonic structures in jazz and related African and Latin American music. Secondly, her artistic influences include Cezanneʼs watercolors done in his later period, Matisseʼs color and compositional structure, and the movement and dynamics of Abstract Expressionism, especially the paintings of Willem De Kooning and Joan Mitchell. “If I could say one thing to a person viewing my paintings for the first time, it would be - give them time to move” – Ellen Priest Priest’s painting practice that emerged from mentioned influences include jazz-based multi-layered abstractions, translucent spaces full of color and light. Her work balance between painting and sculpture – from a distance, it is seen as a vibrantly colored spatial illusion, and when seen up close, the viewer is faced with relief constructions of layered opaque and translucent paper. Each of Ellen Priest’s series of paintings, such as Jazz Cubano, ""Venezuelan Suite"", Berklee, and Chelsea Shuffle series, are based on a single jazz composition. She carefully choses music as an influence, listens, studies the score, makes an image in her mind, and as a choreographer, creates movement of a brush while the music is playing.  Titled Jazz: Edward Simon’s ""Venezuelan Suite"" #1-23, this series of works was created in a period between 2006 and 2010. Priest collaborated directly with a pianist and composer, Edward Simon, while he was composing and including Venezuelan song forms and rhythms into jazz in a four-movement piece. Using form as a language of music, her abstractions capture movement and depict jazz as full of joy and energy. In 2007, Edward Simon’s 7-piece jazz ensemble performed the full Suite in the Main Gallery at the Philip and Muriel Berman Museum of Art in Pennsylvania as a part of Priest’s solo exhibition that included the first ten artworks from the series.  Ellen Priest’s long fascination with Afro-Cuban jazz was visualized in her Jazz Cubano series of paintings, created in 2012. The musical influence chosen for this series is the duo named Dos Y Mas, consisted of Cuban percussionist Arturo Stable and Cuban pianist Elio Villafranca.  Priest has been drawn to this type of music especially because of the percussion, and its movement and space. In order to visualize it, the artist began deconstructing complex rhythms and melodies to simplest components – literary single percussion notes, only to reconstruct them later through painted visual forms. Works that emerged from this musical decomposing formed a series of fifty brush studies. Combining them in pairs, Ellen made another series - the Percussion Drawings. Months later, when she was confident enough, Priest started creating larger brush studies and paintings. In 2013, musicians from the Dos Y Mas duo improvised from her brush studies, creating new musical compositions. This visual and musical interaction between the artists continued, visible in a new series of Priest’s layered, collaged paintings named Jazz Cubano: Arturo and Elio, Thinking Out Loud.  Ellen Priest’s artworks were mainly exhibited throughout the United States, in New York, Philadelphia, Connecticut, Washington D.C. and New Jersey. Her first solo exhibition was held back in 1979, after which she had many more solo and group shows. Since March 2015, Ellen has been represented by IdeelArt. The Pollock-Krasner Foundation has twice awarded Priest major grants, in 2001 and 2007. In addition to her art practice, Ellen has also started a personal studio art program named Eyeball It!, with drawing exercises and video demos for elementary-age children. Ellen Priest lives and works near Philadelphia. Here you can read the latests interview on Ideelart",425

Henrietta Harris,"Henrietta Harris is an Auckland-born artist and illustrator known for her series of distorted watercolor and gouache portraits. Through amazing technical skills, she makes memorable faces characterized by clean brushstrokes. Her artworks have appeared on t-shirts and in galleries around the globe, whilst she has also worked with an impressive list of commercial clients. The artist earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Auckland University of Technology in 2006.  New Zealand-based artist creates her appealing and dreamlike portraits working with paper, pen, watercolor, gouache, acrylic, and occasionally gold leaf. Harris masterly captures the intimate detail and likeness of the subjects with her colorful hand-drawn style using digital methods only to plan her compositions. Often described as a surrealist, the artist actually fuses naturalistic and surrealistic approach in her images of heads that seem to be dissipating like smoke, and doubled, fragmented faces, as if reflected in a broken mirror.    Seemingly caught in moments of a romantic introspection bordering on spiritual transcendence, Harris’ subjects dissolve into swirls, scribbles, and line. Her inspiring, mutable and memorable portraits, hands, faces, brains, glaciers seem to float away from each other, reminding viewers of those moments when your body is present but your mind drifts away to another place far away with the reality that you are in. Her pastel-toned watercolors are calling the person in front of them for closer examination, promising a trip to borderless landscapes, stripped from time and space.   Amongst her paintings of distorted faces, the artist also creates portraits that don’t include faces at all. Instead, she draws their hair, ears and, perhaps, their neck and shoulders. Although she usually makes these sketches quickly, while sitting and watching TV, they attracted a lot of attention, especially among her Instagram followers.[1] Harris also creates landscape paintings usually depicting lofty mountain scenes. Based on real photographs, these works represent both a portrayal of nature itself, but also the artist’s vision of it. In one of her most recent pieces, Gold Mountains, she experimented with watercolor and gold leaf on paper creating majestic snow-filled landscapes.    Henrietta Harris’ major commissions and clients include Vanity Fair, France; The Department Store, Auckland; Karen Walker; Flying Nun Records; VERAMEAT; Coffee Supreme, New Zealand; to name a few. Her works could be found on t-shirts, on record covers and in fine print publications. Her paintings and drawings have been included in many individual and group exhibitions including at High Seas Gallery, Auckland; Greet Street Gallery, Brisbane; Gallery Hanahou, New York City; Plaything Gallery, Auckland; and others. The Hum, one of the most recent solo shows by the artist featured her latest works that highlights less the individual, and instead the forms a person inhabits metaphorically.

Born in 1927 in Schaerbeek, Belgium, he has lived and worked in France since 1951. In 1944, he attended the l'École nationale supérieure d'Architecture et des Arts décoratifs de La Cambre, Brussels where he studied illustration techniques, printing and photography. In the following year, he discovered the work of Henri Michaux, Jean Dubuffet and developed a friendship with the art critic Jacques Putman.

Alechinsky's works combine medieval illustrations, folk art, and comic-book layouts. He once explained that when he paints, he liberates monsters. ""They are the manifestations of all the doubts, searches, and groping for meaning and expression which all artists experience. One does not choose the content, one submits to it.""",429
Robert Baribeau,"Robert Baribeau is an American artist best known for landscapes he explores on his dynamic canvases that reminiscent Abstract Expressionism.  Robert was born in 1949, in born in Aberdeen, Washington. He studied at Portland State University and received his MFA at the Pratt Institute. He has been awarded with a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant, a National Endowment for the Arts Grant, a Pratt Institute Art Department Grant/Fellowship, and a Florence Saltzman-Heidel Foundation Grant as well.  From the very beginning of his career, in the 70s, Robert has been recognized and known for his use of bold, vibrant colors and his thick impasto. During his long career, Baribeau derived elements from Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Color Field and Neo-Expressionism. He has been depicting the energy of post war New York alongside of pastoral and sublime atmosphere, inspired by the Mystical painters from the 50s. By fusing landscapes and abstraction, Robert managed to present nature with a lyrical touch, in all of its purity.  In the 80s, Baribeau started incorporating different shapes, like lines, spokes or circles. Next evolutional step he made in the 90s, when he made so called village paintings – with a small mounds and pictographs. From there, Robert moved to hard-edged geometries complemented with the use of found materials. Everything was usable, from old maps to any discarded household object. By doing so, he created graffiti-like artworks with an element of collage technique.  Baribeau's work from the last decade is characterized by the use of pink, blue and white color. On the first glance it evokes a Romantic landscape, but then, the look goes down, to the lower part of the painting and the clash with the gritty and cacophonous section occurs. His work has been a subject of Artforum, Artnews, The New York Times, The New York Sun and New York Magazine.  This artist is represented by Anna Zorina Gallery from NY.  ",430
Tomory Dodge,"An American artist, Tomory Dodge is best known for painting landscapes with a Surrealist influence, based on photographs of swamps and deserts, clouds and trees. Broadly applying paint with a brush or palette-knife, his canvases are characterized by layers that bleed together, organized by vertical and horizontal rainbow colors, or built-up impasto surfaces. Born in Denver in 1974, Dodge currently lives and works in Los Angeles. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1998 from the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, RI, and his Master of Fine Arts degree in 2004 from the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, CA.

As the artist explains, the brushstrokes in his work are the image. These gestural abstractions combine American history, landscape painting, post-Internet aesthetics, and urban life. In these works, there are many smaller paintings emerging within the composition. ",431
Jurgen Drescher,"A German artist, Jürgen Drescher is best known for his sculptures, but he also creates video, text and performance works. Focusing on everyday objects, he transfers them into ""ready-made"" objets d'art, probing the tension between original and replica, and between reality and fiction. Born in 1955 in Karlsruhe, Drescher currently lives and works in Berlin, Germany. He gained attention while still a student when he exhibited his work Drescher Bar - in which he manned a live bar in an annual exhibition alongside peers Thomas Schütte and Katharina Fritsch. He exhibited worldwide, including Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe, Germany, Kunsthaus, Vienna, Kunsthalle Nuremberg, Germany, Hamburger Kunsthalle, Hamburg, Museum Fridericianum, Kassel, and Castello di Rivara, Italy, among others. He participated in the 7th Shanghai Biennale in 2008 and the Venice Biennale in 1990. Considering the sociopolitical potential of art, Drescher channels the expansive power of the everyday. Taking everyday objects and situations as his departure point, he explores contemporary modes of existence. He is known for metal casts of mundane objects such as cardboard boxes and drains, videos, texts, and performances that dissect how context might alter experience. In his later work, Drescher began using plastic casts to make larger structures that are monuments to economic and cultural exploitation.",432
Tom McGlynn,"Tom McGlynn is an American contemporary artist born in 1958. He is known for his minimalist approach to abstraction and for using monochromatic, contrasting colors. Expressing himself through painting, drawing, photography and sculpture, McGlynn also works as a curator, and is a regular contributing writer to The Brooklyn Rail.  He received his BFA in Printmaking from Ramapo College in New Jersey in 1979, and his MFA in Painting from Hunter College, City University of New York, in 1996. McGlynn is working as a Professor at the Parsons School of Design in New York City. At first look, his pieces seem to be very precise, but a closer look exposes intended imperfection, and clear signs of brush strokes. As he is inspired by consciousness and the ways of its revelation through human experience, the imperfections seem adequate.   The artist has restricted himself to color choice that seems reticent, as he uses colors like blue, red, orange, green, yellow, etc. Far from stability and uniformity, the colors are contradicting and unpredictable. All of his pieces leave the viewers a possibility of different interpretations. That is the key point, as all people, along with their consciousness and unconsciousness are quite different, and we don’t look equally on the same experiences and memories. His artworks are a part of several public collections, e.g. the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York, NY; Jersey City Museum, Jersey City, NJ, and many more. McGlynn's work has also been acquired by the V&A Museum in London, the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design.   He is represented by IdeelArt Gallery in London, UK.

Klaus Kampert,"The search for beauty through art could take you almost anywhere. From the narrative, over style and technique, to our personal preferences, beauty can be found in many of the artwork’s aspects. For the German photographer Klaus Kampert, beauty is displayed through the unity of mind and body, representing the human being as a whole. Although he’d never attended any art-related classes, his practice and works are widely known and have been used by major companies for various campaigns. Bringing together emotion, mind, and the body, his photographs give the beauty of human form a whole new meaning.   Klaus Kampert’s relationship with art started at a very young age, as he used to draw as a boy. Born in 1953 in Düsseldorf, Germany, he, in fact, studied history while practicing photography in his spare time. Focusing more and more on the artistic practice, he had brought a tough decision of aborting his studies in favor of devoting himself fully to photography. Self-thought, he worked for many respected photographers before opening a business of his own in 1981 in Düsseldorf, one that he has enjoyed doing ever since. It brought him great acclaim, as major companies like Audi, Boss, Puma, and others have hired Kampert not only for his skill with the camera but for the simple and elegant representation of a complex narrative in his works.   Kampert’s focus and area of expertise is the portrayal of the human body in his photographs. Attracted to the form of the human body, he emphasizes that there is more to its beauty than what is physically represented. The body is but a vessel for the soul, a link between emotions, mind, and the physical reality it occupies, and by presenting it as nude in his photos Kampert tries to accentuate and reveal this bond. Even though he does deal with nudes in his works, he considers them to fall out of the genres of classic nudes or erotic photography, as they display more than just the body as such. During his years of practice, Kampert found out that ballet dancers are the ones most fitting to portray his ideas through photography. Their nimble, yet strong bodies demonstrate the connection between emotion and beauty and are perhaps closest to the wholeness the artist is trying to reach. Setting up a simple background, Kampert showcases great skill with lighting and shadow, reminding of Horst P. Horst and his style of photography. Using very few graphical elements, his imagery is focused on emotion which can be felt in each piece. He is fascinated with water reflection and its possibilities, and it is a distinct element reoccurring in his pieces.   Looking through the lens of Klaus Kampert’s camera, we are able to see the true beauty of the bare human form - the emotion, the thought, and their intertwining with the body that holds it all together. The simplicity of the surrounding elements which usually consists of triangle, spherical or cubic shapes adds to the weight of the human figure, showing Kamper’s skill as an artist and bringing his ideas to the forefront of his photographs. Regardless of his lack of a formal art-related education, his thriving business and a number of rewards  back up his quality as an artist. The artist is represented by the Artistics Gallery.

Erte,"Romain de Tirtoff, primarily recognized by his alias of Erté, was a Russian-born French artist and designer whose diverse talent was put to a good use in an array of creative fields and works. His pseudonym was derived from the French pronunciation of his initials and it stands as one of the main indicators that this author preferred France over his native country of Russia. Romain de Tirtoff worked hard in many fields of art making, including fashion, jewelry, graphic arts, costume and set design for film, theatre and opera, as well as outlining interior decorations - the combination of these activities ultimately culminated in making Erte a crucial aspect of the Art Deco movement. One of the main creative guidelines this artist followed were the tapering lines and the simplified ornamentation style Erte saw in the natural world surrounding him.  Romain de Tirtoff was born during the year of 1892, in the famous city of Saint Petersburg. He was a member of a distinguished family whose roots were accurately traceable all the way back to the year of 1548. His father, Pyotr Ivanovich Tyrtov, served as an admiral in the Russian Fleet and his line of work heavily influenced the childhood of his son. In 1907, Romain de Tirtoff spent one year living in Paris, a time that will eventually prove to be pivotal for the young artist as it was then that he decided that art could be something worth pursuing a career in. He was utterly fascinated with the Parisian society that was heavily oriented towards art, completely different then all of the people Tytov knew back home. A few years after his return to Russia, Romain managed to persuade his father to allow him to move permanently to Paris where he was able to start chasing his dream of becoming a professional designer. However, Pyotr Ivanovich Tyrtov never truly accepted his son's decision as he desperately wanted him to continue the family legacy of being a part of naval warfare. In order to avoid what his father saw as a disgrace to the family, Romain de Tirtoff assumed an artistic pseudonym of Erte from the point he started working under the guidance of Paul Poiret in 1913. Two years later, Erte secured his first substantial contract with the famed Harper's Bazaar magazine and thus put in motion a distinguished career that initially included designing costumes and style of stage sets[1]. For the next two decades, this author designed over two hundred covers for the Harper's Bazaar, whilst some of his illustrations also appeared in other prestigious publications such as Illustrated London News, Cosmopolitan, Ladies' Home Journal and the unavoidable Vogue.    From the time he established himself as a leading designer in the City of Light, Erte primarily worked on his elegant fashion schemes that completely capture and reflect the Art Deco period in which they were made. His fine figures and sophisticated, borderline over-glamorous designs are instantly recognizable and made such a deep imprint on the world of fashion that they still influence similar authors working in the 21st century. Erte was also well-known throughout the world of theater as his costumes, program designs and sets were featured in numerous prestigious institutions. For example, Irène Bordoni, a celebrated French chanteuse that was a part of many Broadway shows, wore more than a few of Erté's clothing designs. Starting with the year of 1925, Erte was even a part of Hollywood as his sets and costumes were introduced to silent films by Louis B. Mayer. He designed sets and scenery for such films as Ben-Hur, The Restless Sex, The Mystic, Time, The Comedian and Dance Madness[2]. As far as his illustrations go, this author is by far best known for an image titled as The Symphony in Black - a picture that depicts a somewhat stylized, tall and slender woman wrapped in black, holding a thin black dog on a leash. This influential image has been reproduced and copied countless times over the decades. It should be noted that Erté continued working throughout his life, creating illustrations linked to the fashion scene and designing all sorts of aspects commonly found in revues, ballets and operas. Although the interest in his works did not maintain the heights it once had during the first half of his career, Romain de Tirtoff's art had a major creative revitalization and rejuvenated moment during the 1960s with the Art Deco revival[3].   When Erte's career is observed as a whole, it's fair to say that his life was completely devoted to creating various works of graphic art, sets, jewelry, costumes and all sorts of designs. Maybe it is precisely this kind of diversity and willingness to experiment with the unknowns what made Romain de Tirtoff so interesting to his contemporary viewers. The ability to constantly expand your work and surprise the audience is one of the most powerful abilities an artist can have in his or hers arsenal and Erte definitely possessed this capability. Such a multifariousness is also the main reason why Romain de Tirtoff was as important to Art Deco as he was, especially when you consider the wide range of practices that this movement aimed at keeping in its core. On the most conceptual level there is, Erte and Art Deco were virtually made for each other. References:   ",435

Gianfranco Pezzot,"Gianfranco Pezzot is an Italian conceptual photographer who is interested in how various forces, such as history, economics, and instinct, affect the ways we construct and make use of our environment. His abstract work is an attempt at inventing new, contemporary photographic languages. Pezzot graduated from the Drama Academy of Venice, Italy.  In an effort to push the boundary of photography as an artistic medium, Pezzot has adopted an aesthetic strategy akin to assemblage, bringing various, possibly unrelated visual elements together in the construction of a new image. His abstract series Dichotomy of a Human Brain is emblematic of this approach. It was created by combining fragments of photographs of flowers, beach landscapes and crumpled sheets of paper then using that assemblage as a ground for additional artistic interventions, such as drawn lines and scribbled text. The various images and mediums combine to create a complex, layered image, presented in its final form as a digital C-print.  Pezzot is inspired by the way the brain constructs narratives from different images. When those images are altered, restructured, or combined with other images, the narrative becomes more less straightforward, and more interesting to try to interpret. He is also influenced by the changing role of photography as a contemporary artistic medium. He wonders about the value of shooting direct, unambiguous pictures compared to the value of approaching photography from a more open, investigative, experimental, and multi-disciplined perspective. About his series Dichotomy of a Human Brain, Pezzot says:  Works by Pezzot have been exhibited throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas, including at the International Photography Festival in Lille, France, and the International Biennial of Contemporary Art in Florence, Italy. His photographs are included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Photographic Art in Kiyosato, Japan. The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",437

Richard Hunt,"The American artist Richard Hunt belongs to the first generation of post-war sculptors. Although his practice was largely influenced by the modernist legacy, he managed to conquer new territories by developing an authentic visual language mostly based on welding pieces of metal into abstract shapes that became his signature technique.  Hunt gained wider recognition after the exhibition at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, and one of his works was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. Throughout his career, he continually experimented with an array of sculptural techniques, while exploring social and political aspects of both historical and contemporary themes. Richard Hunt attended the University of Illinois in Chicago, and in 1957 he earned a B.A.E. from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. This esteemed sculptor is the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees, and over the years he has produced more public works than any other artist in the United States. ",439

Row's work is mainly characterized by language of painterly fragmented geometric abstraction that is usually formed on shaped canvases and installations. He works with matte surfaces and both muted and high-pitched colors. As he explained, the experience of visiting India as a teenager had a profound impact on his sense of color. All the paintings consist of several canvases, each one a different size. In each, there are lines suggesting huge parabolas. ",440

Building on top of that, Kirsch continued to develop her techniques and looked for challenges both within the art of color painting and in her life. Feeling that the painting is a reflection of human individuality, her works are characterized by the inspiration of the moment. For Kirsch, creating art is more than expressing yourself – it means seeing new things arise, it means to develop oneself, as well as working up both relaxation and emotions. Besides attention to detail, passion is an important aspect of the process. She paints not because she needs to, but because it a matter of particular concern to her. Things develop in the depths of her being and she wants to share those visual ideas with other people. “Painting is an essential asset of mine, without it my life would be - in the truest sense of the word – colorless.” ",444
Rico Gatson,"Even though he uses painting, video, sculpture, and installation, the American artist Rico Gatson prefers not to be defined by any single medium, rather thinking of himself as an object maker inspired by Conceptualism and Performance Art. Known for confrontational and politically opinionated artworks, he often bases them on significant moments in black history.  Born in 1966 in Augusta, GA, Gatson lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. He studied at Bethel College, St. Paul, Minnesota, graduating in 1989, and Yale School of Art, New Haven Connecticut, graduating in 1991. He exhibited in a range of venues, including Miles McEnery Gallery, New York, NY, Ronald Feldman Gallery, New York, NY, The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, NY, Samsøñ Projects, Boston, MA, Studio 10, Brooklyn, NY, Wright Museum of Art, Beloit College, Beloit, WI, Exit Art, New York, NY and Suzanne Lemberg Usdan Gallery, Bennington College, Bennington, VT. Often based on significant moments in black history, Gatson's confrontational and politically opinionated artworks often feature images of riots, fires, and confinement. As he once explained, he is ""interested in seducing the viewer and then hitting them on the way out, allowing a delayed response to powerfully charged content."" ",445
Jeff Robb,"Jeff Robb is a British artist known for his lenticular photographic fine art, focusing on the female nude and abstract forms in space. He graduated with Distinction from the Royal College of Art in 1992 with a Master’s degree in Fine Art Holography and has since been continually making art, ceaselessly experimenting with three-dimensional imaging. Inspired by the nude female form – its countless permutations of body/composition, facial expression, and light, provide both a technical challenge and fascinating problem for the artist to solve. Robb also finds inspiration in his chosen medium – Lenticular Photography, a complicated, expensive process that captures the world and its subjects in a strange, wonderful blend of photography and sculpture. His work, a 2-dimensional print with 3-dimensional illusory properties, suspends the viewer’s perception of reality. The artist feels that this suspension is of great importance for our minds to feel, considering that we (particularly in the Western World) live in a spiritual vacuum. “We need magical inspiration in our lives and I’d like to share a sense of this in my work.” Aside from lenticular photography, Jeff Robb works in a variety of mediums, including painting, bronze, and silver cast sculpture, reflection and transmission holography, photography, film, laser light, and sound installations.

The sculpture is an artistic medium in which he has also been working in recent years.   ",455
Jay Kelly,"American contemporary fine artist Jay Kelly is known for his unique style of creating life-like portraits and collages out of books, photos, and magazines. He began his career creating photorealistic paintings, and in recent decades has started making abstract sculptures. Kelly’s works are a part of numerous collections around the world as well as notable institutions like Brooklyn Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art (NY), Princeton University Art Museum, The British Museum in London, to name a few. His distinctive work has also appeared in numerous TV shows and the fan-favorite movie Donnie Darko.   Self-taught artist Jay Kelly, born in 1961 in Pasadena, CA, started his career as a graphic designer after graduating from UCLA. Only in the late 90s, he began experimenting with figurative collage. Kelly uses meaningful images and bits of text from second-hand art books and attaches them directly to the canvases. At first, he would use paint to get the shadows and highlights right. However, he soon realized that different shades and colors of images and text were enough to archive the desired effect. Once the collage is done the artist covers everything with a thick coat of resin that gives the work the right visual polish, as well as help unify all the elements into one cohesive unit.   Kelly has a unique way of playing with the point of view. Firstly the image is seen from afar and looks like photography however, as the viewer draws closer, he slowly discerns all the small pieces that are part of it. At that moment, the true exploration of Kelly’s artistic genius begins, for there are layers of meaning in each of his pieces. He mostly draws inspiration from nature images that are far from traditional scenes. Instead, they are contemporary compositions derived from a careful blend of classic beauty and modern life, which all have one thing in common – emotion. Kelly’s abstract sculptures show the architectural and the organic at the same time. He uses metal wire, Japanese paper, wood, gesso, and nickel silver to create shapes, nets, and smooth non-referential forms. The surfaces are often weathered and aged with patina. The final result are sculptures that often remind one of works by Alexander Calder, Paul Klee, and Tim Burton.   Even though Kelly is a contemporary artist, he refuses to be a part of the detached digital world where there are no questions unanswered. Thus he has decided that his collages are there as something tangible in such an impersonal world. His work celebrates the nostalgia of the past while bringing a classic beauty and mystery from a lost moment in time into the present day. Art for Kelly is not just to be gazed upon and enjoyed but to transport and inspire the viewers. Jay Kelly lives and works in New York City.    ",456

Elizabeth Peyton,"The whole painterly practice of Elizabeth Peyton has been marked by the particular genre of rather intimate and sensible portrayal. The use of the genre is almost always led by the artist’s urge for analyses of one’s persona, but in this case, the very approach to psychologization is what makes it so different and quite authentic. Regardless of class, race or gender of depicted subject, Payton pays special attention to their inner state and the very situation in which they are being portrayed. On the other hand, the selection of models or the way they are being represented reflects the artist's interest in different types of bodies and faces which may lead to her work being interpreted in regards to feminist and gender theory.   Elizabeth Peyton was born in 1965, in Danbury, Connecticut. She began drawing at a young age, and in between 1984 and 1987 studied fine arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Shortly after the end of her studies, Peyton worked several jobs and held only one solo exhibition in six years. Interestingly, in 1993 with the financial aid of Courtney Love, grunge femme fatale and then wife of Kurt Cobain, she had the first successful exhibition in the room of notorious Chelsea hotel consisting only of drawings. Afterward, the galerists noticed Peyton’s work so she started exhibiting at Gavin Brown's Enterprise in New York since 1995, at Neugerriemschneider in Berlin since 1996, Regen Projects in Los Angeles since 1997, and Sadie Coles HQ in London since 1998.   The usual technique Peyton uses is oil, but watercolor, pencil, and etching are present as well and her most frequent feature are washy glazes of dripping paint. The artist is pretty much inspired by the works of Nadar, Alfred Stieglitz, and Robert Mapplethorpe. The painterly process starts from photographs. Namely, Peyton uses to shot her subjects with either a standard 35-millimeter or a Polaroid camera, without any particular focus on composition or lighting and in 2002  transferred to a digital camera. The figures depicted are often slender, almost androgynous, and thus sexually ambiguous. They are usually involved in some kind of melancholic activity – sleeping, sitting or daydreaming. Since 2007, Peyton has included a still life to her range of subjects.   The continued focus on stylization celebrities made her art being perceived as deriving from popular culture. It is no wonder that one of her major influence is no other than notable painter David Hockney. From David Bowie, over Oasis’s brothers Gallagher, Jarvis Cocker,  Princes William and Harry of The House of Windsor, to Kanye West, Payton has painted all of them in the same unpretentious manner. One of her works became a cover for the compilation album The Best of Suede. The artist has even collaborated with artist superstar Matthew Barney on a project titled Blood of Two, as well as with Jonathan Horowitz on a series of monotypes which develop upon the concepts of plants and flowers as motifs of love and death.    Over the years, the works of Elizabeth Peyton became part of various important collections from Centre Pompidou in Paris, over the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, to Kunstmuseum in Basel. For her work, Elizabeth Peyton received in 2006, the 14th Annual Larry Aldrich Award honoring an artist who has had a significant impact on visual culture. In 2007, she was honored with amfAR’s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS. Interestingly, this year the artist will show her works for the first time in Japan at Hara Museum of Contemporary Art in  Tokyo.   The works of Elizabeth Peyton were often seen as fashion illustrations, and at the same time, she has been credited for having revived the tradition of portrait painting.  Therefore, the artist was described by a professional public as a forerunner of new Realism. The astounding body of work has not just revealed the immense contribution to reviving forgotten stylistic approach but suggests a particular insight in the studies of popular culture from a new perspective.

Karel Appel,"Held in high regard for the way he was able to depict genuine expression through the use of uniquely vivid colors and strong forms, Karel Appel was an influential Dutch painter who created some of the most pivotal abstract works of the 21st century. Bearing the influence of Jean Dubuffet and the Art Brut movement, Appel's work is a fantastic indicator of how the art of his time established a bold gestural style and rejected many cultural and artistic values of the post-WWII period. Besides of his contributions to the development of abstract expression, Karel was also a co-founder of the CoBrA group, a pivotal organization which formed many creative concepts with Asger Jorn and several other Danish, Belgian and Dutch artists at its creative helm. Even though Appel is fundamentally recognized for his paintings that merge elements of figuration and abstraction, this author also experimented with relief sculpture and design[1].  With a full name of Christiaan Karel Appel, this painter was born in his parents' house at Dapperstraat 7 in Amsterdam during the year of 1921. The entire family was supported only by Karel's father who held a barbershop on the ground floor of their house. When he was about the age of fourteen, he produced his first complete painting on canvas. This was a still life composition as Appel opted to depict a rather classical and popular scene of a fruit basket. After the family picked up on his early talent, Karel's uncle gave him a paint set and an easel. He also received some private tutorships which were intended to direct him down the right path of painting. During the years of the Nazi occupation, Appel studied at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam. Here, the young painter met Corneille and Constant - this newly formed trio of friends and artists shared many outlooks on art practices. Due to the wartime circumstances, Appel had to wait for the year of 1946 to hold his very first solo exhibition[2]. Two years later, Appel and his two painter friends joined CoBrA, an avant-garde group active in Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam. During the year of 1949, he participated with the other CoBrA artists in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, generating a huge scandal within the community and many objections in the press. His greatest inspiration at this point was the aforementioned French brute-art painter Jean Dubuffet. During these forming years, Appel also sculpted quite a bit, exploring what this kind of art making had to offer. He would frequently use disregarded materials in order to make such pieces.    As it was clued at previously, the CoBrA group was noted for their notorious artworks and activities. In that regard, Appel lacked no talent - for example, his fresco Questioning Children was painted in the Amsterdam City Hall in 1949 and stirred such a ruckus from the Dutch people that the town saw it necessary to cover the painting up a few years later. As a result of this controversy and other negative reactions to CoBrA, Appel left the group and moved to Paris in 1950. He would also travel to Mexico, the United States, Yugoslavia and Brazil during this period, all in order to find inspiration and right influences. All along the way, Karel never stopped painting murals as this seems to be the most constant kind of artworks of his career. He continued to develop his Brut art concepts for the next few decades, seemingly being a part of many movements and modern groups. When the 1990s began, he was finally accepted by the Dutch public as a crucial artist of modern expression, one without many of their movements would not be quite the same. Ultimately, he became the most famous CoBrA author despite being one of the first members to leave the group[3]. Soon after he was finally given the attention he deserved for the majority of his career, Appel started suffering from a heart ailment. This illness affected him for the rest of his days before belatedly ending his life on the third of May in 2006. He died in his home in Zürich, Switzerland, but was buried in Paris according to his wishes. A few years prior to his death, the author established the Karel Appel Foundation with goals of preserving and promoting his artworks[4]. In one of the more interesting cases concerning this foundation, a number of Appel's works went missing in 2002. This situation was never truly solved but the paintings were recovered in 2012 after they were found in a disused UK warehouse.    Only a chosen few were able to use abstraction to the point this author was capable of - Appel's paintings are not only some of the greatest Dutch abstract artworks but are counted within the most prestigious modern pieces of the entire Old Continent. His vibrant colors, violent brushwork and thick application of impasto paint had a massive echo throughout all modern and contemporary art history. Among other things, Karel Appel was responsible for the rejection of rationalism and geometry within a painterly composition, opting instead for more intuitive and expressive practices. After we combine that fact with all of his activities with both the CoBrA group and Informel, only then do we start assembling the entire picture of just how influential and crucial Appel's art truly was.

Bernard Frize,"A French contemporary artist, Bernard Frize is well known for his experimental approach to painting. Referencing Minimalism, Abstract Expressionism, and Color Field, the artist mainly focuses on the mechanics of painting, exploring the bare minimal essence of painting, devoid of conception and aesthetic. He often works in series, following strict rules as to process and palette, and employs assistants in elaborately choreographed acts of painting. Frize was born in 1949, in Saint-Mandé, France. He lives and works in Paris as well as Berlin. His artworks have been exhibited extensively across Europe (Centre Pompidou in 2019) and the UK (Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, as one example), as well as recently in the United States. Since the beginning of his career, the artist has been focusing his attention exclusively on the act of painting. He sees a painting as a search for an agreement between ""nature"", a viewer and a flat surface. His work with an embellishment of specificity for a conceptual aim in and of itself—rather than glorifying any one process as key towards something beyond painting. ""This is what my paintings are about and why they are not about the process,"" he once explained. ""Nevertheless, the process is a way of engaging the viewer in a kind of simultaneity."" ",466

After his early period involved with expressionistic figuration, in the early nineties, Ciria developed a dialogue between the uncontrolled flow of the stain and the rigor of geometry. His tireless experimentation in the terrain of materials and supports would soon be added to that initial program. During the 90s, he created numerous series whose main thematic axes were time and memory. ",468

Anne Russinof,"Anne Russinof is an American abstract painter whose work examines color and structure in a gestural, expressionist manner. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Russinof earned her BFA in Printmaking from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1979. She earned her Masters of Fine Arts degree in Painting and Printmaking from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1982. She has completed residencies at Yaddo and the Millay Colony for the Arts, both in upstate New York. She has been a member of American Abstract Artists since 2014. Russinof has exhibited throughout the United States, most extensively in New York City and the surrounding area.  For Russinof, everything begins with color. As she says, “Color serves to create a window onto natural space and light.” She begins a painting by applying color in lyrical, gestural marks. The marks coalesce into a structure, a loose grid. She adds layers; color relationships evolve; depth emerges; a sense of form is suggested. If the composition does not resolve itself effectively, she scrapes it all off and begins again from a place of deconstruction. Her compositions feel intuitive, almost casual, but the process is quite intentional. Russinof came to painting from a background in printmaking. She arrived at oil on canvas after working her way through various mediums, surfaces, and processes. Her practice currently fluctuates between works on paper and works on canvas and small-scale and large-scale work. The smaller paintings allow her to work through ideas quickly. The works on paper allow her the chance to experiment with new mediums and techniques.  Russinof is inspired by things she sees: a visceral reaction to manifest a feeling physically through paint. That initial visual stimulus is often related to color. The purpose of the work is not to imitate something she saw or even to capture a sense of it. Rather, she is inspired by the search; the mystery of what will happen; the suspense of waiting to see how the wet layers of paint are going to interact. She often works on several canvases at once, letting an environment of anxious play guide her from image to image, hoping to coax something elusive into being. She is motivated by the challenge of adding only what needs to be added in order to attract the eye, and stopping before the image becomes chaotic.  Russinof wrote the following for a 2016 catalog: The artist is represented by IdeelArt. ",471
Menashe Kadishman,Menashe Kadishman was an Israeli artist born in 1932 in Tel Aviv. He was best known for his metallic sculptures and colorful sheep paintings.,472
Stanley Whitney,"American artist Stanley Whitney is known for exploring possibilities of color in his abstract paintings. He creates artworks that possess unexpected cadences of space, rhythm, and color. Influenced by his African-American heritage and Abstract Expressionism, he separates the color fields into gridded blocks. The artist possesses a unique talent for creating gestural lines bursting with energy. Whitney’s work is part of several collections around the world, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven and Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City.   Stanley Whitney was born in 1946 in Philadelphia. In the 60s, when it was expected for a Black artist to create artworks that reflected African American life, Whitney came to New York with an ambition to create abstract paintings. He found himself at odds with the cultural scene of the city. However, he refused to change his artistic expression, for he always saw himself as a colorist. The artist graduated from Kansas City Art Institute with a BFA and went on to receive an MFA from Yale University. Influenced by the works of Pollock, Matisse, Rothko, and Cezanne, he refused to compromise and was largely ignored by the New York scene. In 1973 Whitney became a professor at the Tyler School of Art and Architecture. In the 90s, the artist moved with his wife to Italy, where he was well received. There, he drew inspiration from rich architecture designs, such as Pantheon and Colosseum.   In his early works, the artist left empty space around patches of color. Influenced by Roman architecture and art, Whitney shifted his compositions in more horizontal grids that possessed a balance between geometry and color. For over a decade, he drew while listening to jazz music by Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, and Ornette Coleman incorporating the rhythm and the emotion into his work that he often described as an improvisation itself. Whitney's work is dictated by the first choice of color, which dictates the next one and so forths. Thus the artist never knows what the finished paintings will look like leaving it all to spontaneous improvisation. In his artwork, one can see a variety of influences, including the compositions of Velázquez, Titian, and Minimalism as well as Southern quilts.   The artist finally gained the recognition of the American public after two simultaneous exhibitions in 2015, one at Karma gallery downtown and the other at the Studio Museum in Harlem. For his painting titled Light a New Wilderness, the artist broke the personal record at an auction, where it was sold for $700,000. The works in the latest exhibition titled TwentyTwenty at the Lisson Gallery in New York, inspired by jazz music and the works by Edvard Munch. For the year 2023, the Buffalo AKG Art Museum is planning a major retrospective of Whitney’s works. Currently, the artist works as a Professor at the Tyler School of Art, Temple University. Stanley Whitney lives and works in New York City and Parma, Italy.  ",473
Chris Ofili,"Christopher Ofili, known as Chris Ofili, is an English Turner Prize-winning painter and a member of Young British Artists movement. His works are recognizable for their vibrant palette and a variety of applied textures, such as glitter, magazine cut-outs, resin and even elephant dung. When it comes to the main topic of Ofili’s work, it is the exploration of both contemporary and historical black experience through challenging racial stereotypes.[1] Because of his use of elephant dung in paintings, the well-known controversy has arisen over the Ofili’s work entitled The Holy Virgin Mary. [caption id=""attachment_299770"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Chris Ofili - Shithead, 1993 - image via hyperallergic.com[/caption]  Chris Ofili was born in Manchester, Great Britain but his family is originally from Nigeria. The artist has attended St. Pius X High School for Boys and later studied in London, at the Chelsea School of Art and at the prestigious Royal College. In 1992, he got a one-year exchange scholarship to Universität der Künste Berlin and also additional scholarship that allowed him to travel to Zimbabwe. It is important to mention that Ofili showed a keen interest in African cave paintings there, which had a certain effect on his style. His artworks often make references to blaxploitation films and gangsta rap, questioning racial and sexual stereotypes in a clever and humorous way. For instance, in a series of faces that Ofili called Harems, each work consists of one man with as many as four women around him. Ofili's work typically consists of layers of paint, resin, glitter, dung and other materials suitable for collage. His early paintings were heavily influenced by artists such as the legendary Jean-Michel Basquiat, Georg Baselitz, Philip Guston, and George Condo. Chris Ofili has also been the founder of the short-lived Freeness Project, which involved the gathering of artists, producers, and musicians of minority ethnic groups, like Asian and African. The goal was to expose and give voice to the creativity of lesser known contemporary British ethnic minority artists. Ofili himself became established through exhibitions by Charles Saatchi at his gallery in north London and through the traveling exhibition from 1997, called Sensation.   One of Ofili’s most famous paintings called The Holy Virgin Mary, initiated a lawsuit between the mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The controversial artwork was exhibited in 1999, as a part of the Sensation traveling exhibit. This painting represents a Black Madonna surrounded by small images from blaxploitation movies and close-ups of female private parts from pornographic media and magazines. There are also lumps of elephant dung which look like the cherubim and seraphim found in the imagery related to the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary. Ofili’s so-called scandalous painting was ranked No.86 in 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America.[2] However, not everyone was against Ofili - Red Grooms showed his support and open-mindedness by purchasing one of Ofili's artworks in 1999. The Holy Virgin Mary was eventually bought by a collector and it is now on display at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania. Despite this incident, Chris Ofili became renown as one of the few artists of African descent from the Great Britain who got recognized as a member of the Young British Artists. His work can be found in the important permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Tate Gallery, London; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; the Saatchi Collection, London; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others. The artist has moved to the island of Trinidad in 2005, where he still resides and works.   By using various references from African music, culture, religion and textiles, Chris Ofili became the master of experimenting with unconventional techniques, materials and subject matter. His vibrant, technically complex and meticulously executed collage works were awarded Turner Prize in 1998 because of their boldness, audacity, and innovative nature. Through his intricate and highly original paintings, Ofili explores widely diverse and historically important themes, such as sacred ideals, identity issues, black history, high and low culture as well as universal self-awareness. The artist is represented by D. Zwirner London, D. Zwirner 19th Street and D. Zwirner 20th Street.  Sources:  ",474
Bernard Buffet,"Bernard Buffet was a French artist who belonged to Expressionism, famous for his rich body of work in painting, drawing and printmaking. Bernard Buffet was born on July 10, 1928 in Paris – the city where he grew up and spent majority of his childhood. He was never really keen on education, which is why he was suspended from Lycee Carnot in Paris in 1939. His talent, however, was undeniable, and it was recognized by École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts (National School of the Fine Arts) which he started attending in 1943 when he was only 15 years old. For two years, he had been studying under the mentorship of Eugène Narbonne in Narbonne’s studio, along classmates Louis Vuillermoz and Maurice Boitel. He again dropped out in 1945 and moved with his mother to Brittany.  The years that followed witnessed the talented Buffet’s breakthrough into the world of art. At the “Salon des Moins de Trente Ans” at the Galerie Beaux-Arts, the showing of Buffet’s first self-portrait took place in 1946, and by the next year, he had exhibited L’homme accoude at the “Salon des Independants” (of which he became a member) and had his first solo exhibition at the “Art Impressions” book shop in Paris. This exhibition proved to be crucial in Buffet’s career, as his painting Nature Morte au Poulet was sighted by Raymond Cogniat, who purchased it for the Paris National Museum of Modern Art. The show also caught attention of Pierre Descaruge, who was compelled by Buffet’s work and became the artist’s greatest supporter. Later on, he included Buffet in the “Presses Litteraires de France”. 1948 was Buffet’s milestone year. He entered into a contract with Emmanuel David’s gallery “David et Garnier”, which opened the door to world scene for Buffet, gaining him international recognition. That same year, he received the Prix de la Critique award at the “Galerie Saint-Placide”; he was only 20 at the time. Later in 1948, his painting La Ravaudeuse de Filed was featured in the exhibition at the “Salon d’Automne”.  From this point on, Buffet was moving a lot. Until 1951, he lived in a friend Jean Giono’s house in Manosque, when he moved to Nanse, only to stay there for three years. In 1955, he again relocated in Domont, and the next year, he went to the Chateau l’Arc near Aix-en-Provence, where he lived till 1964. During this time, his work had been exhibited extensively. Since 1949, he had exhibitions every year at the “Galerie Douant-David”, the “Galerie David et Garnier”, and “Galerie Maurice Garnier”. In 1952, a series of themed exhibitions started, and there have been 52 shows so far. Listless figures and visions of great violence were a part of the shows, especially early ones which rendered him infamous among his contemporaries, but had also brought him in the spotlight of art in France and the world. In 1955, Buffet was featured in the “Connaissance des Arts” magazine’s list of the top ten post-war artists, ranking at number 1. Three years later, the New York Times included him in the list of “France’s Fabulous Young Five”; a list where his contemporaries, such as Yves Saint-Laurent, were included. 1958 was also the year when his first retrospective exhibition was held, at the Galerie Charpentier; he was 30 at the time. In December, 1958, Buffet married Annabel Schwob, a French actress and writer. They had three children: daughters Virginie (1962) and Danielle (1963), and a son Nicholas (1971). They moved to Brittany in 1964, where they resided until 1970.  Bernard Buffet was appointed the Legion of Honours by the Académie des Beaux Arts in 1974. The French postal administration asked him to design a stamp illustrating “l’Institut et le Ponte des Artes” in 1978, and later on, the Post Museum housed a retrospective of his work. Buffet moved to Normandy in 1980, and then again to Domaine de la Baume in 1986, where he resided with his family until his death. Buffet was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease late in his life. The illness finally made it impossible for him to create, which drove him over the edge. On October 4, 1999, Buffet committed suicide in his home, at the age of 71. He suffocated by putting a plastic bag over his head and taping it around his neck.  Even though Buffet was primarily a painter, he also did some work in lithography, sculpture and engraving. Themes of his paintings were numerous; he painted portraits, still-life, religious works and landscapes. His bleak and harsh, yet emotionally charged images depict sad, lonely and detached figures; they are “ugly”, but somehow still appealing. The gloomy colors he used, primarily the different hues of gray, black and green, make his pictures appear crude. For his La Passion du Christ themed series, he painted Deposition from the Cross, which is now a part of the Vatican’s gallery. The piece was originally done for the Chapelle de Chateau l’Arc. Buffet’s pieces of Paris, made in cubist style, contribute to his extensive body of work, amounting to over 8,000 paintings, drawings and lithographs. By using the seemingly brutal straight lines, Buffet manages to convey the simple, but still complex and beautiful Paris. As Buffet developed his expression through his career, his style had stayed more or less the same. However, landscapes became the main focus in the later part of his career. Bernard Buffet lived and worked all over France. He died in 1999. Images copyright of the artist",475

Pierre Auville,"Pierre Auville is a French self-thought artist born in 1968 in Le Havre. Since he was young, he was interested in making street art, painting surfboards and sailboats. He is known for applying various techniques and materials that can be found in construction and shipbuilding industrial areas. This is where he got in touch with numerous surfaces and manufactured shapes that he later incorporated in his artworks. Before finding himself in art, Pierre explored many different fields of interest, which were sometimes completely unrelated. Auville work is focused on the modest palette of colors, usually a variety of white, beige, gray, and green, mostly depending on the structure of the cement - his main medium.   Unlike many other artists, Pierre didn’t have any artistic background. He studied political sciences at the famous Science Po in Paris. Being inspired by different artistic pieces like graffiti seen on the street walls, he decided to practice art by himself. After graduation, he worked as a journalist for design and home interiors magazines, had a number of management positions in metal industry, joined the French Navy for a period of time, and also spent some time in the medical emergency services. While he was working, Auville took evening classes in fine arts, for almost a decade. His mentor was the renowned painter Anne Papalia. Throughout his aesthetic presentation viewers can see the elements and the influence of modern art movements like the Geometrical Abstraction, Arte Povera, and Street Art.    For more than twenty years, the author has explored a vast spectrum of materials, techniques, and mediums before he found out the cement. Due to its rawness and versatility, Pierre is able to show the original essence of the hand-made materials. He mostly works with the Portland type cement, made of clay and lime, because it enables muted tones to emerge by themselves. The difference in color depends on the season and location when it was produced, but also on the additional mineral pigment ingredients like slate or coal powder. For the contrast in bright colors, the author adds water-based spray paint during the drying process. Special effects in the form of erosion, corrosion, carving, and polishing are achieved by mechanical treatment, by using sandpaper, steel wires wool or scrapers, and by intense washing.    The artist is famous for incorporating construction, industrial, and manufactured materials in his artwork. He applies them over surfaces like Ursalite (high-density foam panels), and adds metal structures, thus creating pieces ranging from one to eight square meters. Pierre art references to different colors of minerals found in stone, like the one from the Lascaux cave in France, the roads of California, or the abandoned WW2 ""blockhouse"" that line the Atlantic coastline of Western Europe.  The artist is represented by the IdeelArt Gallery. He lives and works in Paris, France. ",479

Marc Desgrandchamps,"Marc Desgrandchamps is a French artist who became famous for his surreal, enchanting compositions that enthrall the viewers almost instantly.

Marcy Rosenblat,"Marcy Rosenblat is an American abstract process painter who creates layered, colorful and complex paintings and prints. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Rosenblat earned her BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1981, and her MFA from the Vermont College of Fine Arts in 2010. She received a grant from the Women’s Art Development Committee in 1998. She taught painting at Parsons School of Design from 1986 to 1989, and since 1995 has been an Adjunct Professor of Fine Arts at the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, NY.  Rosenblat describes herself as having an affinity for process art, a method of art making in which predetermined systems and techniques largely determine the outcome of the work. The textured appearance of her paintings emanates from the intervention of common household products such as paper towels during the painting process. To begin each painting, she lays the canvas flat on a moveable easel then pours paint onto the surface. She then tilts the easel in predetermined ways, turning it then tilting it again, allowing the paint to drip down the surface. She then presses the paper towels or other textured products into the wet paint. The pressing leaves behind the imprint of the surface of the textured product, while simultaneously revealing the under layers of paint. It is a process of covering and revealing. Meanwhile, each successive layer of paint drips onto the sides of the canvas, so that in the end all colors used in the painting can be discovered on the periphery, even though some of them may have ultimately been obscured or removed from the surface.  Rosenblat is inspired by the idea of revelation and obfuscation—what we see versus what is hidden from us. She wants viewers to see her final product as a finished phenomenon, but also wants to offer them a chance to peek behind the curtain, so to speak. Each layer of paint is like a veil, through which viewers can see the inner workings of her craft. She is inspired by the idea that this will invite people to look more closely at things. Rosenblat is also inspired by the patterns she sees on ordinary surfaces, especially those not usually related to painting. That was the genesis of her choice to start using paper towels in her work, and in the same vein she often photographs the surfaces of the ground, the street, and objects she sees in the store then uses those photographs to create textures and patterns that will serve as layers of color in her paintings and prints.   Marcy Rosenblat has exhibited extensively, especially in and around New York City. Selected exhibitions include Fordham University, Galerie Berlin am Meer, The Rawls Museum, and the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art. Her work has also been featured on Hyperallergic. The artist is represented by IdeelArt.  ",484

In between 1954 and 1962 while at the residency in Paris, the artist familiarized himself with Letterism and the works by George Mathieu, which became defining influences for his own artistic practice. From the 1960s Staudacher plunged even more into abstraction, and his particular aesthetic can be described as a unique combination of lyrical Informel and Abstract Expressionism. His career is marked by few important national representations in the international context such as the Venice Biennale in 1956, Tokyo Biennale 1965, and São Paulo Biennale in 1975. Staudacher was also often awarded for his domains throughout his long and successful career, and his works are held in important public and private collections around the world. ",486

In purely visual terms, his compositions are very much inspired the Old masters such as Caravaggio and Goya, but also the flamboyance of the 1980s, while the overall effect is achieved with the usage of splattered paint and stencils, as well as non-conventional materials like black glitter, rhinestones, and sequins. Shimoyama graduated from Penn State University in 2011 with a BFA in Drawing/Painting before obtaining his MFA at Yale University School of Art in 2014. He received the Al Held Fellowship at the Yale School of Art in 2013 and his works were exhibited throughout America on numerous occasions. ",509
Gianni Motti,"An Italian visual artist, Gianni Motti creates interventions designed to highlight the contradictions that inform contemporary society. Through his practice, he aims to question authority, while fully exploiting humor's potentials as a truth-revealing weapon. Born in 1958 in Sondrio, Italy, Motti now lives and works in Geneva, Switzerland. He has exhibited all over the world, including Galerie Johnen + Schöttle in Köln, Museum of Modern Art in New York, The Bathroom, Lyon and D + T Project in Brussels. Motti contextualizes ready-made objects in unexpected ways, producing sculptures, videos and site-specific installations. Working within the varied arenas of sport, finance, media, international politics, parapsychology, he frequently incorporates performative and politically charged elements, often turning the strategies of power against themselves. The paper currency is among his recurring motifs, representing a symbol for the ambiguous materials behind the power structures of Western civilization and in reference to the European Union’s press to eliminate the use of paper cash in favor of electronic money. From hijacking a busload of Japanese tourists and taken them to an art opening to organizing a national telepathy event in Bogotá urging President Ernesto Samper to resign, Motti’s improbable actions contain lessons about the freedoms we take for granted.

Paulo Roberto Leal,"A celebrated Brazilian painter, Paulo Roberto Leal focused on the concepts of emptiness, voids, interstices, and silence. Often described as a new, post-modern type of artist, Leal was interested in materiality, but above all in an expansion of the concept of painting. Born in 1946, Leal lived and worked in Rio de Janeiro. He held a degree in economics and worked for many years at the Central Bank of Brazil. A self-taught artist, he never went to an art school, learning his new trade through contact with artists and art critics and as a frequent visitor to exhibitions and studios. In this period, he began collecting art by Brazilian artists, including Ivan Serpa, Franz Weissmann, Amilcar de Castro, Lygia Clark, Willys de Castro, Volpi, Ione Saldanha and Raymundo Colares. His artistic career, which started in the late 1960s, was cut short by his premature death in 1991. For Leal, reflecting on painting meant thinking of supports as surfaces. He started with the canvas fabric itself, sometimes painted in the back and on the front, cut and sown – with occasional loose threads to break up the composition’s rigidity. His most radically constructive work is the series Entretelas (1974-1976), comprised of stitched canvases, painted with oil, whose stitched lines define modular and symmetric spaces. ",511
Ida Kohlmeyer,"Louisiana’s most renowned artist at the time, Ida Kohlmeyer is known for paintings and sculptures characterized by exuberance and painterly freedom. Her canvases are filled with joyous color, motion and vitality. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1912 to Polish immigrants, Kohlmeyer earned a Bachelor of Arts in English at Newcomb College, the former women's coordinate college of Tulane University. She became interested in art during her honeymoon in Mexico, influenced by ceramic folk art of Central and South America. She completed a Master of Fine Arts in painting in 1956 and then studied at the painting school of the artist Hans Hoffmann who influenced her to shift towards abstraction. Her encounter with Mark Rothko the following year further shaped her style. Expressing deep feelings directly onto a canvas, Kohlmeyer developed a distinctive vocabulary of shapes and symbols, organized initially in grid format and later in loose flowing patterns. Her paintings speak to the arbitrariness of symbols as well as to the universal desire to communicate. In her later career, she began creating metal sculptures, comprised of vertical arrangements of both geometric and organic shapes. She described her drive to make art as a ""compulsion, a withdrawal from much that is pleasurable in life, a need to work, for which no other activity can substitute, and a constant search for self.""

Monika Kovatsch,"Monika Kovatsch is a German artist whose work can be perceived as a modern reinterpretation of abstract art. Despite the visual harmony, she reflects contemporary statements in her works, achieving it through a unique technique, where the flow is essential. Focusing on nature and atmosphere, Kovatsch finds inspiration in capturing reflectance, light, and the mood of natural scenes. ""The abstraction of reality enables me and the beholder to have different insights in my artwork."" She holds a Master's in Environmental Planning and Ecological Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. After graduation, she began working as a junior expert for Land Use Classifications. Influenced by her work that uses satellite data (e.g., at the German Aerospace Center) and having gained experience with various projects in Africa but also within Europe, Kovatsch is familiar with contemporary topics such as the refugee crisis due to climate change, but also with the associated challenges that might occur in the future. As an environmental planner, her goal is the conservation of nature and its beauty. As an artist, she portrays a variety of natural highlights in an abstract way. Monika Kovatsch is based in the Munich area    ",520
Marcelo Mendizabal,"Marcelo Mendizábal is an Uruguayan contemporary artist known for utilizing threads, ropes, stitches, and knots in his abstract paintings. At first, he used the cord, thread, and rope to saw small papers with a needle, creating wefts that interacted with the signs applied directly onto the support. Those wefts grew over time, occupying more space, making a texture and a warp the artist found ""deeply expressive."" One day, he discovered that the backside of the sewn paper had stitches and knots, so he began exploring the reverse side of the weft. ""The idea of flat translation for that weft became then recurrent thinking. I began to incorporate digital technology, and confronted the digital format with the real one, looking for a contrast."" Mendizábal's recent works were created in the era of the global pandemic, dominated by uncertainty and isolation. As such, they contain ""a weave that both holds us apart and binds us, barely allowing us a brief glimpse at what lies beyond. A mesh on top of other meshes that both shelter us and set our limits. A solitude propitious for introspection."" The ambiguity of outside and inside becomes apparent as the additional warp of threads ""denotes subjection, security, whilst suggesting a possible way out, a path out of the labyrinth, like Ariadne's."" The artist studied Fine Arts at the National Fine Arts University (ENBA) in Montevideo and attended Courses at Humanities University, UDELAR, and Cinematography courses at 'Cinemateca Uruguaya.' Marcelo Mendizábal lives and works in Montevideo.     ",521
Carolina Alotus,"Known for active and energetic compositions, Carolina Alotus is a Swedish contemporary abstract painter whose works are luminous, fantastical arenas in which beauty and harmony negotiate fiercely with chaos. Self-taught, she embraced abstraction after working as a figurative painter specialized in lush, dreamlike, large-scale reproductions of flowers. Shutting off the mind chatter and creating from heart, the artist doesn’t consciously put symbolism into her paintings, despite occasional references to numbers, letters, or other recognizable imagery. Carolina Alotus was born in Malmo, grew up in the Goteborg region, eventually moving to Cyprus in 1990, where she still lives and works.     Featured image: Carolina Alotus - Pretty little thing (Abstract painting), 2020 (detail).

Carson Cartier,"Carson Cartier is an abstract Canadian artist who seeks to unify painting, photography and fashion through his work. His paintings can be read as gestural abstract representations of forward thinking aspects of the contemporary human condition, such as speed, technology, and motion. Cartier employs untraditional painting tools and methods in order to create compositions that, although painterly, almost seem to be digitally produced. This convergence of the human mark with a cyber-inspired aesthetic is an expression of the emergence of the human race into a new age of technological advancement.  His visual language is intentionally sparse, relying solely on black and white, and decidedly linear—a reference to the linear aesthetic vision of the Futurist painters, who were also concerned with such issues as speed, technology, and innovation. In fact, Cartier frequently invokes the Futurists philosophy and energy in his titles and personal writings about his work. Cartier is based in Vancouver, Canada.

CRASH,"The seventies were an extremely interesting part of history. Amongst a number of social, political, and economic events that changed the way we perceive the world around us, the decade saw the growth of graffiti culture that began in New York City and brought fame to numerous highly talented artists. One of the artists who has been at the forefront of a new art movement is John Matos, better known as CRASH to graffiti lovers. CRASH stands as the representative of the first generation of graffiti artists, and though he deals with the imagery of comics, he gives it his own flavor and do it in his own unique style.  Born in 1961, in the Bronx, New York, Matos took his alias after he unintentionally crashed the computer in his high school. As a teenager growing up in the Bronx, CRASH grew up riding the subways in NYC and using sides of wagons as canvases. Working alongside other pioneering American Graffiti artists, such as Dondi White and Zephyr, CRASH’s bold, blocky signature graffiti on trains began to appear throughout the city. The first years of the 1980s were the turning point of his career when he started transitioning from trains to galleries.    In October 1980, 19-year-old CRASH curated the pivotal exhibition entitled Graffiti Art Success for America at Fashion MODA in the South Bronx. The show, which included work by artists such as Futura 2000, Lady Pink, and John Fekner, was one of the first to allow the writers to paint directly on the walls and facade of the gallery. This groundbreaking exhibition has played a crucial part in legitimizing the graffiti movement. It opened up new possibilities for graffiti in a gallery setting connecting street artists and the downtown fine arts world, with CRASH as a pioneer.   In the following years, CRASH started exhibiting his artworks across the US, as well as overseas. In 1983, he had solo show at Sidney Janis Gallery, and one year later, Crash had a breakthrough in France – alongside such legends as Robert Combas, François Boisrond, Hervé di Rosa, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Keith Haring, he participated at the exhibition named 5/5: Figuration Libre, France/USA at the Museum of Modern Art of Paris. Since then, his oeuvre has been exhibited in more than 150 shows in museums and galleries throughout the world. His work is included in such notable collections as the MoMA in New York and the Groningen Museum in the Netherlands. He has partnered with many companies for brand collaborations including Absolut Vodka, Levi’s, Ferrari and more. For Fender Musical Instruments, he painted guitar amps and famous “Crushocasters” guitars, played by such guitarists as Eric Clapton and John Mayer.   Over the years, CRASH has developed his own instantly recognizable style that fuses pop iconography and graffiti. His paintings - always realized with spray cans - seem to depict the modern world's pure essence, revealing a pictorial inventory close to comics, letting explode colors and expressing the artist’s moods, feeling and thoughts. Often inspired by American artists Roy Lichtenstein and Tom Wesselmann, his imagery is filled with bright flashy colors and tightly cropped compositions. With four decades of experience in graffiti, CRASH remains recognized as one of the pioneers of the movements and legend of the Bronx whose work inspired a whole generation of young artists. The artist is represented by Zimmerling & Jungfleisch in Saarbrücken, Germany, Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art, Miami, FL, Rosenbaum Contemporary, Boca Raton, Rosenbaum Contemporary, Bal Harbour, iDroom, Geneve, Galerie Brugier-Rigail, Paris, and Vroom & Varossieau in Amsterdam.

Claude Rutault,"A French minimalist and conceptual artist, Claude Rutault was best known for a distinct way of expression he created and titled definition-method, which is basically a manual how to create-update his art piece. Born in Trius-Moutiers, France in 1941, Rutault had a highly important role in art in France since the 1970s. He began using his definition-method in 1973, inspired by the event when he repainted his walls of kitchen and accidentally covered a small painting he had left. He soon published a text that forms the instructions of an evolving work that should be ""updated"" by its ""taker"" such as a collector or museum. As he explained, canvas should be braced on a stretcher, painted the same color as the wall on which it is hung, using standard formats available in the trade and traditional hanging arrangement. The identity of the canvas color with the wall has led to the development of a corpus of over 300 definitions/methods.  All of Rutault’s paintings prior to 1973 have been entirely repainted following this principle. The artist has broken away from the strict color identity between the canvas and the wall by taking his paintings away from the wall, stacking them or placing them on the floor or up against the walls.  ",528
Ryan Callanan,"Ryan Callanan aka RYCA is a British contemporary printmaker, known for his works in graphics and for his prints. Working for quite some time on the Street Art scene, Callanan has begun to slowly turn away from his establish aesthetic to a new kind of practice, drawing from his thorough knowledge of craftsmanship and materials, which he gained during his academic training in 3-D design and industrial model making. Beginning with the emblematic visual sign, Ryan developed his series of works incorporating the smiley face, which stands as an equivalent of the 80s acid house rave culture. Black gilded background and gold inlay, which are usually associated with traditional pub signs, define Callanan’s style and materials he uses to create his bas-reliefs and iconic motifs. Ryan acquired and perfected this very demanding technical skill over the course of his prolific career in the sign making industry.  A mastery of such technique provided Ryan with the ability to create a series of works in this visual style. He expanded the range of his motifs, adding the Watermelon and the Cherry of a fruit machine, once again changing the meaning by using this plane visual pun. The reason why Callanan opted for symbols is because they are inherently universal – everyone can comprehend what they refer to, and everyone can enjoy them. Modern pop culture serves as a source of inspiration for Ryan; this includes music, the history of art, and film, among others. All these typical themes can be noticed throughout his practice. Staying true to his pub style, Ryan transferred his visual aesthetic from symbols to texts. In this case, he again draws from pop culture, mainly the 90s rap and hip hop lyrics of the songs that are significant to him, or everyday colloquial phrases such as “fan-fucking-tastic”. The characteristic feature of Ryan’s works is this concept of the cross reference. He takes two or more items out of context, blends them together, and provides us with something that feels familiar, but the meaning of this new creation is slightly changed. The effect his pub style has is evident – it is something that exists in the subconscious and collective psyche of the British, making it even more familiar. It becomes an unconsciously absorbed reference point against which the words or symbols can react.  Callahan still continues to develop his practice and style. He is working on a number of public commissions, as well as lyrics-related project. He’s been exhibiting since 2011, and has taken part in shows and projects all over Europe and the US. He is represented by Robert Fontaine Gallery in Miami.  All images copyright © the artist",529
Dale Chihuly,"Dale Chihuly is an American artist and glass sculptor. He uses glass as the primary medium for his installations and large-scale sculptures. Born in 1941 in Tacoma, Washington, Dale Chihuly was introduced to blown glass technique and learned how to melt and fuse glass while studying interior design at the University of Washington, in 1961. In 1962, he drooped out of school to study art in Florence. He later traveled to the Middle East and met architect Robert Landsman. Their meeting and his time abroad spurred Chihuly to return to his studies. In 1963, he took a weaving class where he incorporated glass shards into tapestries. After graduating in 1965, Chihuly enrolled in the first glass program in the country, at the University of Wisconsin. He continued his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he later established the glass program and taught for more than a decade. Chihuly created several remarkable series of his work over the years, like Cylinders and Baskets in the 70s, Seaforms, Macchia, Venetians, and Persians in the 80s, and Niijima Floats and Chandeliers in the 90s. He used his Cylinders to create glass-thread drawings on vessels inspired by Native American textiles. Colorful threads are carefully laid out in an intricate design and fused onto the vessel when it is in its molten stage. Baskets were inspired by Northwest Coast Indian baskets, struck by the grace of their slumped, sagging forms, capturing this grace in glass. On several occasions, Dale was forced to stop his work progress. In 1976, while Chihuly was in England, he was involved in a car accident during which he flew through the windshield. His face was severely cut by glass and he was blinded in his left eye. After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his right shoulder in a 1979 bodysurfing accident. No longer able to hold the glass blowing pipe, he hired others to do the work. Chihuly explained this change, saying ‘Once I stepped back, I liked the view’. This accident allowed him to see the work from more perspectives and enabled him to anticipate problems faster. Chihuly describes his new role as ‘more choreographer than dancer, more supervisor than participant, more director than actor.’ Venice has been the city crucial for Chihuly’s work. His Venetian series is an homage to Italian Art Deco vases, it’s aesthetic and symmetry. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice. There he observed the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. In 1995, he began Chihuly over Venice, for which he created sculptures at glass factories in Finland, Ireland, and Mexico, then installed them over the canals and piazzas of Venice. Chihuly’s work is exhibited in more than 200 museum collections worldwide, including in the United States, Canada, England, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts.",530
Ellsworth Kelly,"Without the slightest trace of doubt in mind, Ellsworth Kelly was one of the greatest 20th-century abstract artists emerging from the United States. His pure forms and colors blended with the tendency to suppress gesture in favor of creating spatial unity within the composition paved the way for Kelly to have massive influences on both the Color Field painting and Minimalist movement. Ellsworth's work mostly consisted of bright, monochromatic shaped canvases and sculptures the artist derived from the occurrences of everyday life surrounding him. Ultimately, his efforts towards validating Abstraction as a genuine creative expression is Kelly's greatest contribution to modern and contemporary art history[1].  Ellsworth Kelly was the second son of Allan Howe Kelly and Florence Bithens Kelly, a couple who lived in Newburgh, a town located approximately 60 miles north of New York City. Allan Howe Kelly worked as an insurance company executive, whilst Ellsworth's mother Florence was a school teacher. His gene pool was rather mixed as Kelly had Scots-Irish, German, Welsh and Pennsylvania blood running through his veins. The young artist's family lived near the Oradell Reservoir where his paternal grandmother presented him to the science of ornithology for the first time when Ellsworth was about eight or nine years of age. It was in Oradell Reservoir that Kelly developed his deeply rooted passion for color and form. There are many experts, such as Eugene Goossen, that agree that this artist's career was so devoted to color simply because his childhood's fascination with observing birds never completely left his mind. In that sense, all Ellsworth was doing for the entirety of his career was chasing the same delight he experienced while he was still a toddler at the Oradell Reservoir. His early devotions to birds and nature may have been further forced upon him by the slight stutter that persisted into his teenage years, making Kelly feel very isolated when surrounded by unknown people. He attended the local public school and was lucky enough to end up with the right professors who aimed at developing his creative imagination. As a matter of fact, it was a school teacher that encouraged him to pursue an art training despite Kelly's parents being against such a radical and life-altering decision. Kelly studied at the prestigious Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, an institution of which he was a part of from the year of 1941 until the moment he was inducted into the Army on New Year’s Day of 1943.   Hearing that the 603rd Engineers Camouflage Battalion was taking many young artists at this stressful time, Kelly desired to be assigned to that company upon entering the United States military service in 1943. However, after a six weeks training, the young artist served in a deception unit known as The Ghost Army. This company's goals were simple - to mislead the Axis forces about the direction and disposition of Allied forces by using inflatable tanks, trucks and other elements of subterfuge. Due to a lot of exposure to military camouflage, Kelly's future visual vocabulary would be reinforced by this experience. Kelly served with The Ghost Army unit from 1943 until the end of the European phase of the war.  After returning home, Ellsworth decided to accept the G.I. Bill program and study at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston where he took advantage of the museum's collections. Showing great potential, he was soon offered an opportunity to attend classes at the legendary École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While the ex-soldier and a WWII veteran was at this institution in France, he would study day and night, exploring all the advantages this school had to offer and eventually establish his aesthetic vocabulary. Immersing himself in the rich artistic resources of the French capital[2], Kelly found an artistic guiding star within the work and character of Paul Cézanne. He also met fellow Americans John Cage and Merce Cunningham in Paris as the two were in the experimental phases of their career. Some sources state that Ellsworth also befriended Jean Arp to some extent. After being abroad for six years, Kelly decided to return to America in 1954. Like many of his contemporaries who returned to New York after a long time of art studying in Europe, Kelly found the Big Apple scene way too rough and uninteresting.    It took Kelly a long time to adjust and break through the ranks of the NYC scene. His first solo exhibition was held at Betty Parsons' Gallery during the May of 1956. As expected, his art was considered more European than was popular in New York at the time. His pieces were considered radically different from the other works available at the time - a characteristic that became Ellsworth's trademark at one point. However, he was not able to become as popular as he wanted and after over fifteen years of working in the Big Apple, Kelly left and settled in Spencertown in 1970. Here, he was finally able to release his Abstraction without any boundary that weighted his creativity in New York. In 1973, Kelly began regularly making large-scale outdoor sculpture artworks which remain as some of the greatest abstractly sculptured pieces ever made[3]. Both his paintings and sculptures thrived in these new circumstances. Ellsworth first added curved shapes to his repertoire, something he was terribly lacking in the past decades. Ultimately, this led to a pivotal break with the rectangular support and his redefinition of painting’s figure-ground relationship. He was also finally able to use the space surrounding the pieces to his advantage, achieving excellent results that he always wanted and heavily influencing the global development of installation along the way.  In later paintings and sculptures, namely those from the 1980s and 1990s, Kelly distilled his palette and introduced new forms that altered his creative vocabulary a bit[4]. The artist explained his own work in 1996 by stating the following: I think what we all want from art is a sense of fixity, a sense of opposing the chaos of daily living. This an illusion, of course. Canvas rots. Paint changes color. But you keep trying to freeze the world as if you could make it last forever. In a sense, what I've tried to capture is the reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get at the rapture of seeing. To this day, this remains as one of the greatest explanations of abstract art ever put into words. From 2001, Kelly worked in a 20,000-square-feet studio reconfigured and extended by the architect Richard Gluckman in Spencertown. This room will ultimately be the last working studio of Ellsworth as he spent the last years of his life creating art within these walls[5]. Kelly passed away on December 27 in the year of 2015. He was 92 at the time.  When one observes Ellsworth Kelly's career as a whole, it's not a challenge to conclude just how pivotal his work was for establishing Abstraction as a valid field of art making. His explorations of light, space and color were crucial for all of the modern and contemporary art, having massive influences on Pop Art, Color Field painting and Minimalism. His sculptures, paintings and drawings are some of the best abstract pieces ever made and it would be foolish to even consider discussing the United States' scene of Abstraction without analyzing the life and work of Ellsworth Kelly. This artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art Miami. References:   ",531
Red Grooms,"Red Grooms aka Charles Rogers Grooms is an American multimedia artist known for his lively and colorful pop-art pieces portraying busy urban life scenes. His unusual, endlessly amusing painted collage sculptures depict both fictional and observed scenes and they are characterized by Grooms’ strong talent for stylization and his sharp sense of humor. He created his most famous pieces using the complicated, painstaking technique of putting together various painted depictions into so-called sculpto-pictoramas, which are a unique combination of painting and sculpture. After he moved from Nashville to New York in the mid-50s, Grooms collaborated with other creative people belonging the Pop Art movement.  Grooms is originally from Nashville, Tennessee and he was born during the time of Great Depression. He studied fine arts at the Art Institute of Chicago and Peabody College in Nashville. Grooms decided to move to New York City in 1956, where he enrolled in the New School for Social Research. Around the same time, he attended a summer session at the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He got his nickname Red while living in Provincetown, where he worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant before he became a full-time artist. It is important to underline that Red Grooms belongs to the generation famous for the intelligent sense of humor and keen desire to comment on the human condition. Grooms is often compared to the Marx Brothers because of his impetuous, unstoppable energy and ability to be both solemnly serious and extremely witty, depending on the occasion. He was also compared to Marcel Duchamp, who is again a notably witty, tongue-in-cheek commentator of the human condition.   One of the first projects Grooms participated in happened in the spring of 1958. Together with Yvonne Andersen and Lester Johnson, Grooms painted twelve-foot by twelve-foot panels, which were placed on telephone poles on a parking space close to the amusement park in Salisbury, MA. We can call these panels an old fashioned version of today’s billboards. but what is really important is that Grooms’ distinctive talent for visual arts already at that time won the considerable amount of public exposure. In addition to visual arts, Grooms was also fascinated with performance and acting, which dates back to his childhood days in Nashville. During the late 50 and early 60s in New York, he created Happenings, which were traveling events staged by a group of young performers, still outside of the established art world of New York City. These performances were a wild, chaotic blend of improvisation and studio practice. The best-known happening was The Burning Building, which was staged at Grooms’ studio in Lower East Side of Manhattan. Grooms has always been a very prolific and versatile artist and today he’s considered one of the pioneers of site-specific sculpture and installation art. One of his first worldwide renown pieces was City of Chicago, from 1967 - a large, walk-through installation containing sculptures of celebrities such as Mayor Daley, Hugh Hefner, and Abraham Lincoln, with a burlesque background music. This installation is confirming Grooms’ amazing capability to create humorously bizarre compositions. His another famous sculpo-pictorama, from 1975, is called Ruckus Manhattan and it consists of a number of mixed-media installations which became Grooms’ signature works. Ruckus Manhattan features colorful three-dimensional constructions and cartoon-like characters, inspired by the most diverse inhabitants of New York City. Grooms’ talent for creating caricatures is more than evident in this series. He literally transformed the Grand Central Terminal into a hilarious 3d caricature of Big Apple and its people. In addition to Grand Central, this installation features other typical NYC locations such as Central Park and the Appolo Theater as well as figures of tourists, shoppers, taxi drivers, gamblers and prostitutes.   Besides his famous paintings, sculptures and installations, Grooms is also renown for his dedication to printmaking. He is quite creative and experiments with non-traditional printmaking techniques – he creates woodblock prints, uses spray-painted stencils and constructs elaborate three-dimensional lithographs. After he bought a hot-glue gun in 1973, he started creating stunning pieces of paper sculpture. Later on, in 1979, Grooms spent some time at the University of New Mexico, where he first learned to work even in bronze.   Grooms talent to reveal the city’s dark side and frenzy as well as its sparkling allure turned Manhattan into an exciting wonderland. His warm-hearted parody and satirical approach pay homage to Big Apple in a unique way and his work is highly appreciated and loved for its comic-like character. Grooms' pieces have been shown across the United States, Europe, and Japan and they are included in the permanent collections of roughly 40 museums Grooms was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for his innovative and humorous work that won the hearts of his audience and art critiques. The artist is represented by  Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art and Puccio Fine Art.  ",532

He exhibited in a range of venues, including Galerie Lelong & Co., Paris, France, National Museum Cardiff, Cardiff, Wales, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield, United Kingdom and Royal Academy, London, United Kingdom. Working with natural materials such as wood, Nash uses equipment including chainsaws and an axe to carve the wood and blowtorches to char it. He often works with live trees, transforming them into unexpected shapes. Also a land artist, he is best known for Wooden Boulder. A work which begun in 1978, it involves the journey of a large wooden sphere from a Welsh mountainside to the Atlantic Ocean. It is large wooden sphere carved by Nash in the North Wales landscape and left there to weather.",534
Henri Matisse,"Henri Matisse was a French painter and printmaker, as well as one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century. His stylistic innovations fundamentally altered the course of modern art and greatly affected the works of several generations of younger painters that followed. Matisse's brilliant use of color and exaggerated form was truly groundbreaking at the time and it's quite impossible to overstate his importance to contemporary painting. The bitter rivalry he shared with Pablo Picasso and the movement of Cubism led Matisse to the creation of a whole new moment in art history - Fauvism.  Henri-Émile-Benoît Matisse was born on the New Year's day of 1869 in a small industrial town of Bohain-en-Vermandois, France. Like the most people from this northern French town, almost every member of his family was employed in a local grain company. However, Matisse did not choose this life for himself as he was much more interested in studying law. He found a job of a legal clerk and ultimately went to Paris to learn the trade at the law university. After graduating in 1889, Matisse got a position in a law office in the town of Saint-Quentin. Interestingly enough, he did not show any significant sign of artistic tendencies before coming to Saint-Quentin.   Trying to brighten up the dull days of working in a law firm that did not turn out to be as interesting as he previously expected, Matisse started attending drawing classes. After a few months, when he was the age of 21, he suddenly got diagnosed with an illness that prevented him from going to work for a while. All the time he was tied to bed, Matisse spent painting. Soon after he got better, Henri realized he felt more happy while sick and painting then when he was well and working. He quit the job and made a choice to go to Paris and seek further artistic education. Being financially well off, he was able to afford studies at such institutions as the Académie Julian and the École des Beaux-Arts.    Learning at prestigious schools meant working by academic principles and Henri was fine with that up until the day he was exposed to the recent Post-Impressionist work of Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh. This had an enormous impact on young Matisse who was still undecided if he will take modern or traditional painter's steps. He began to show his work in large group exhibitions in the mid-1890s - including a show at the dreaded Salon, with whom aforementioned Cézanne had many issues. He received some favorable attention and positive reviews from the critics. Soon he married Amélie Parayre, with whom he would have three children.  Where Cézanne and van Gogh failed to fully attract young Matisse, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac were more successful. By the turn of the 20th century, Henri began painting in the Pointillist style - a method of painting in which an artist uses small dots of color rather than full brushstrokes. Soon he cut ties with the Salon and turned towards the more progressive Salon des Indépendants. In 1904, he had his first solo exhibition at the gallery of the art dealer Ambroise Vollard.    Matisse had an impressive creative breakthrough in the years 1904 and 1905 when his color palette suddenly turned much brighter. This can be attributed to a journey he had at the time in which he visited Saint-Tropez in southern France and a Mediterranean commune of Collioure, where he painted two major pieces - Open Window and Woman with a Hat. He exhibited both paintings in the 1905 Salon d’Automne and a contemporary art critic wrote an article about them, stating the boldness and distortion of images created by a certain artist he nicknamed fauves - wild beasts.   Accepting the term used by the Parisian critic, Matisse continued to emphasize the emotional power of curved lines, powerful brushwork and acid-bright colors - all obvious in his masterpiece The Joy of Life. Like much of Matisse’s mature work, this painting captured a mood rather than simply trying to depict the world as we see it. After creating his own personal style, Henri Matisse enjoyed a great deal of success. This allowed him to travel extensively, visiting Italy, Germany, Spain and North Africa - all very usual as sources of inspiration. He bought a large studio in Paris and signed a contract with the prestigious art dealers of Galerie Bernheim-Jeune.    During the year of 1909, Matisse created an important pair of paintings - Dance I and Music. With these, he continued to delight audiences with the signature elements of saturated color, flattened pictorial space, limited detail and strong outlines. All of the above became trademarks for Matisse's art. Some of his works from this period had Cubistic elements (like the Piano Lesson from 1916), but not much. This was almost certainly down to the relationship Matisse had with Pablo Picasso as the two were considered lifelong archrivals. They were both extremely successful and wealthy thanks to their art but had complete opposite ideas of color and form.    In 1917, Matisse began spending his winters on the warm Mediterranean and in 1921 he moved to the city of Nice. From 1918-30, Henri mostly painted female nudes in carefully staged settings, but also spent a lot of time printmaking and illustrating books. He received several major commissions, such as a mural for the gallery of collector Dr. Albert Barnes, titled Dance II, in 1931. He was forced to undergo surgery in 1941 and after the procedure was mostly bedridden - making full circles, as his career started the same way, by painting in the privacy of his own bed. Until the end of his life he continued to experiment with painting, he loved writing and illustrating his books, decorating interiors and creating images out of colored paper cutouts. Matisse died on November 3, 1954, at the age of 84.  The first scholarly book about Matisse's importance to art history came out in the year of 1920 - when Henri was still in his early fifties. This speaks enough of how much appreciation there was (and still is) dedicated to Matisse's work, as he was marked as a vital part of modern history while it was still taking place. Only one other man had the same treatment and that was his already mentioned rival, Pablo Picasso. As was said before, you really can't overestimate the influence Matisse had on the painting scene. He developed a whole art movement that was literally a one-man show and it opened the door for all the modern painters that followed after him.  The artist is represented by Puccio Fine Art in New York, US. Featured Image: Henri Matisse - Photo of the artist - Photo Credits Business Destinations All Images Photo Credits Wikipedia ",535
Clay Ketter,"Clay Ketter is an American contemporary artist active in the fields of photography and painting. His works are characterized by skillful combination of content and execution. Born in 961 in Brunswick, Maine, United States, Ketter lives and works in Malmö, Sweden. He holds a BFA from School of Art+Design, Purchase College, State University of New York. He worked initially as a carpenter and cabinetmaker, a skill which would become part of his artistic practice. He has had solo shows in New York, Paris, London and Copenhagen, as well as participated in group shows at Whitechapel Gallery and Saatchi Gallery, London, Lunds Konsthall and Museum of Artistic Process and Public Art/Skissernas Museum, Lund. In 2009, he had a major solo show at Moderna Museet in Stockholm. His work is in a range of public collections, including Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, Arken, Ishøj, Astrup Fearnley Museet for Moderne Kunst, Oslo, Bonnierföretagen, Stockholm, Brooklyn Museum, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. Having a background as a carpenter and builder, Ketter creates work inspired by built environments, drawing on the craft of his earlier trades to explore the intersections between architecture, sculpture and painting. His early works are characterized by an oscillation between construction and fine art.",536
Judy Pfaff,"By focusing fully on relations between compositional elements, Judy Pfaff plunges into a search for a perfect form which is governed by both intense planning and improvisational decision-making. For over four decades, the artist creates works on the verge of media, so it can be said that the hybrid forms are her forte. Two or three-dimensional constellations of Pfaff are basically dynamic environments in which space seems to fluctuate as if it is an organic form. Led by the intuition and a fixed concept at the same time, the artist allows the artwork to be modified constantly during the process until the best result appears.   Judy Pfaff was born in 1946 in London. She was raised in a rather humble family, though her father was absent from her life. Soon after Pfaff was born, her mother moved to Detroit and left Pfaff and her brother to be raised by their grandparents. Growing up in post-war and severely damaged  London was bleak, but in 1956 she reunited with her mother and attended Cass Technical High School. Due to bad relations, at the age of 15, she left home and married a U.S. Air Force officer. Afterward, Judy Pfaff attended Wayne State University and Southern Illinois University, completing a BFA at Washington University in 1971. Pfaff enrolled in the MFA program at Yale University School of Art and was dazzled by other disciplines such as physics, medicine, zoology, and astronomy. Pfaff taught at the California Institute of the Arts from 1976 to 1979 and joined the faculty at Bard College in New York in 1994, where she is currently the co-director of the Studio Arts program.   Judy Pfaff was on the pioneers of installation art in the 1970s, and also participated in Process Art and the Pattern and Decoration movement which continued to reflect on her future artworks. The artist started engaging painting, sculpture and prints in order to produce installations. Although Pfaff uses steel, fiberglass, and plaster, she also draws upon found and natural objects. Extremely complex and layered, her prints were quite progressive at the time, and still are among the most innovative examples of contemporary printmaking today. Due to exuberant and elaborately impure installations, she became characterized by critics as the collagist in space.   While starting out and experimenting as an artist, Pfaff articulated the exterior side of her imagination, only tackling the surface of her artwork since she focused on trivial almost painterly matters. As she progressed, the artist went even further in investigating the inner relations between the elements. Critical towards modernism in regards to her leftist standpoints, Judy Pfaff focused more on displaying emotions that she harbored within herself. That is how she came gradually to conceiving her installations, not like chaotic clashes, but rather as an emotional playground where she is set completely to herself. Therefore, by employing the high level of intuition and sensibility, which was a related to her feminist agenda, Pfaff started anticipating the characteristics of decades like the ’80s flamboyance and optimism, as well as ’90s insecurity and vulnerability.   Pfaff has received numerous awards for her work, including a John D. online Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award (2004) and fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1983) and the National Endowment for the Arts (1986). Major exhibitions have been held of her work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (2002), Denver Art Museum (1994) and Saint Louis Art Museum (1989).[2] In 2013 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Judy Pfaff is an artist who displays what controlled chaos is in sculpture form and governed by the ideals of permeation and ongoing change, which makes her activity in accordance with the contemporaneity.

Ashley Oubre,"Ashley Oubré is an American self-taught artist, known for her large-scale drawings made with graphite powder, india ink and carbon pencil, created in a photorealistic style. Artist’s objective is not to replicate photography, but rather to instill senses of empathy and wonderment, for and about the subject. As long as the artist can remember, the human condition has been a source of enchantment for her.    Ashley Oubre was born in 1984 in Washington D.C. She took an art history class at the age of 19, after which began her complicated relationship with art making. At first, Ashley painted abstractions, then experimented with mixed media. Eventually she found her place in pencil drawing, but after only a few works done, she left her art-making and made a long break. Only a few years ago Oubré quit her job doing administrative office work, and decided to entirely devote herself to drawing and delve more into art. Despite the fact that she suffers from hand cramps, the artist sees the process of drawing as a sort of therapy, and a way to express her inner feelings of melancholy and loneliness.   The scarred, the lonesome, the uncomfortable, the forgotten – Ashley Oubré‘s subjects share amorphous feelings. Much like the nature of jellyfish, swimming in a quiet current, the portrayed subjects seem overwhelmed with a kind of wistfulness most don’t understand on first sight, but by which some are intrigued and dare to follow.  Drawn to subjects that are socially damaged in some way, she cites lost love, self-loathing, bitterness, misery, loneliness and human indignity as her main points of interest. The artist’s great understanding of the notion of the body allows her to utilize these states of human condition in order to show melancholic and intriguing, yet beautiful imagery. Her work echoes a certain darkness. Through it, she embraces excluded and marginalized, portraying things considered abnormal by the society – obesity, stretch marks, age spots and depression.  Oubré perfected execution of light, shadow and texture within the grey-toned images. The artist’s skills are seen through immaculate detail and precision of each of her artworks. The negative space left around her figures creates a world of vacancy, in which portrayed subjects appear floating, frozen in moment in time. Oubré is represented by the Robert Fontaine Gallery, located in Miami.   All images courtesy of Ashley Oubré",538
Jaume Plensa,"Spanish artist Jaume Plensa is best known for his monumental sculptures made from various materials, such as bronze, polyester resin, steel, concrete, marble, and glass. Among his most renowned public works is the Crown Fountain, giant video portraits that sprout water, located in Chicago’s Millennium Park.  Plensa’s work can be found in a number of cities around the world, including Burj Khalifa, United Arab Emirates; Bastion Saint-Jaume, France; Bonaventure Gateway, Montreal, Canada, and BBC Broadcasting Tower and St. Helens, England. Throughout his career, the artist has received numerous rewards, such as Premio Nacional de Arte Gráfico, Medaille des Chevaliers des Arts et Lettres by the French Minister of Culture and Creu de Sant Jordi Award.   Jaume Plensa, born in 1955 in Barcelona, attended the Escola Superior de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi and the Llotja School. The mostly self-taught artist preferred to travel often and has worked and lived in England, Berlin, France, Belgium, and the USA. Plensa was a teacher at the l’École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. In 2015 the artists won the Global Fine Art Award in the category of “Best Public Outdoor Installation” at the 56th Venice Biennale for the exhibition titled Together at the Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore. For over 3 decades, the artist has created public art that activates public spaces and brings people together. His sculptures, ranging from delicate paper works to huge public installations, are inspired by the beauty of humanity, yet they possess countless dualities, such as earth and sky, interior and exterior, and light and dark.   For the artist, the language is a metaphor thus, his work never carries a specific message. For Plensa, the biggest inspiration is the human figure, which he sees as the universal symbol. His latest work is the 80-foot-tall sculpture titled Water's Soul (2021). The artwork symbolizing the importance of water, located on the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway in Jersey City, is made out of marble dust, fiberglass, and polyester resin. In 2020 Plensa has unveiled two major works – Dreaming, located in front of Richmond-Adelaide Centre in Toronto, and Behind the Walls close to the University of Michigan Museum of Art. The artist celebrates the diversity of human cultures through work that intuitively communicates with the viewers. However, some of his artwork is also abstract, as is the case with the 2005 installation titled Breathing. Commissioned by the BBC, the artwork projecting light 3000 feet into the sky, was made in honor of all the journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty.     Jaume Plensa's work is incomplete without interaction with the viewers. It evokes intellectual engagement on a deeper level resulting in inward reflection. At the moment, Plensa is the only living artist who has exhibited at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas. In 2018 he was awarded the Honorary Doctorate from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. Plensa has had numerous exhibitions around the world, including MAMC–Musée d’art moderne et contemporain Saint-Étienne Métropole, Saint-Étienne, France; The Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio and Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid Spain. Jaume Plensa lives and works in Barcelona, Spain. ",539

Mark Mastroianni,"Mark Mastroianni is an American artist, known for creating atmospheric paintings using primarily warm earth colors. He received his education at Ohio State University, earning his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1981. He worked as a studio assistant to Malcolm Morley until 1995, and has been working as an Instructor of Life Drawing at Cherry Valley Community Center in New York since 2011. Mastroianni draws inspiration from nature, seeing beauty in simple things, such as the motion of water, and the play of light as it reflects from it. Even though he mostly paints on canvas, Mark's favorite surface is tar paper, because it gives smoothness and evenness to his paintings.  Mark's art could be classified as geometric abstraction. However, the complexity of his style defies any formal classification. The influences of Rothko is noticeable in the way he accentuates color. Patterns and shapes are also important in Mastroianni's works – especially rectangle. Rectangles enable him to divide the surface he's working on, setting up a basis onto which his artistic language builds up.  The artist's paintings is in both private and public collections across the world, like Scandinavian Friends Inc. In Hamburg, Celmark in Sweden, and Worthington Industries in Ohio, US. His works have also been displayed in many galleries and museums worldwide since 1982. Some of his more notable exhibitions include a 2009 duo show Signs of Life with Rick Begneaud, and a 2012 solo exhibition Natural Wisdom, both of them organized by Woodward Gallery.

Ashlynn Browning,"Ashlynn Browning is an American artist best known for her abstract paintings – its geometric forms, put together in a process of layering. Browning was born in 1977. She got her Studio Art and English BA at the Meredith College of Raleigh and her Painting and Printmaking Master of Fine Art at North Carolina University.  When this artist creates her artworks, she never makes a plan or follows a study – what leads her artistic expression is intuition or even accident. Ashlynn Browning is close to classic Abstract Expressionist method where one is to mark a mark, and then respond to that mark, and so on.  Ashlynn uses charcoal, oil pastel and graphite to create a mixture with paint. Until 2006, she mostly worked on paper. Afterwards, she chose panels to work on and by doing so, oil painting started dominating among her techniques.  If we are to search for some touchstone in Browning’s art, those would definitely be a geometrical forms and stacked forms, grids and networks as well. Also, she pays a lot of attention to colors – usually, they strictly depend on her current emotional state and a sphere of interests… However, Guston pink is constant in her work. Browning holds grants and residency fellowships from the Joan Mitchell Foundation, United Arts Council, Vermont Studio Center, and Virginia Center for Creative Arts.

Delphine Brabant,"Work of Delphine Brabant is set in motion by the eternal confrontation of opposing forces. Exploring the dance between shadow and light, balance and imbalance, and strength and fragility - while focusing on pure geometrical forms, this French sculptor creates artworks that manage to keep their harmonious composition, no matter how intense the dance was. During the process of direct shaping, she truly enjoys all the little surprises that many different materials hide within.  Delphine was born in 1964, in Lille, near France's border with Belgium. She was born into a family of artists and began expressing her creativity very early. In 1990, Brabant started her studies with the famous French artist Jean-Marc Lange, a winner of the Premier Grand Prix de Rome at the age of nineteen! The sculpture course she took involved practice with live models so Delphine quickly developed an affinity for working on the representation of a human face, giving her pieces more personal characteristics. One of her first experiments in that field was her shaping sculptures out of ascending forests of human beings.    Delphine’s representations of human groups all have the same theme: the relation between the horizontal and vertical position. Her upright figures look as if they are trying to see or reach for something high above their heads. With time, this figurative dimension was gradually diluting, leaving just the trace of those relations, hardly visible but essential for the entire composition. This artist's figures started to form a forest of beings just to become a group of slender forms. Brabant was persistent in a wish to simplify her figures as much as she can, not losing the sight of her seminal goal: to unleash the true nature of the material used in the creation of the sculpture, enriching the work with its powerful spiritual and elemental characteristics. Whether she used bronze, steel, concrete, plaster, clay, stone or wood, this artist insists on confronting the benefits and the limitations of any material. Maybe it is because she holds tight to the philosophy that the better understanding of a material inevitably leads the artist towards more successful juncture of the idea of sculpture and a material from which was made. This artist is represented by the Artistics Gallery.  ",543
Jean-Baptiste Huynh,"Jean-Baptiste Huynh is a well-known, prize-winning French photographer known for his series of works made in Mali, Japan and India. Born in France in 1966 to a French mother and a Vietnamese father, Huynh is an autodidact who taught himself photographic lighting and printing techniques, which he mastered to the point of developing a personal style. Between 2006 and 2012, he compiled a study of light through six photographic projects: MIRRORS (2006), TWILIGHT (2007), FIRE (2008), MONOCHROME (2009), LOUVRE (2010) and BLIND (2011), all assembled in the book Lumière along with the personal exhibition Rémanence hosted by the Louvre. Winner of the Villa Medici outside the walls in 1997, he exhibited in prestigious international museums, including the European House of Photography in Paris, the National School of Fine Arts in Paris, the Louvre and the National Museum of Asian Arts - Guimet. His pure and timeless photography explores widely varied themes and subjects, including portraits, nudes, minerals and plants, as well as spiritual symbols and emblematic masterpieces. His thematics include the human gaze, our image of ourselves, the play of light, a sense of timelessness, and an attempt to capture infinity. ",544
Pedro Cabrita Reis,"One of Portugal’s best known artists, Pedro Cabrita Reis is known for his complex oeuvre that spans very disparate media, from the painted over pencil and pastel drawings, the large scale painting, via sculptural works to site specific installations that can reach architectural dimensions. Pedro Cabrita Reis was born in 1956 in Lisbon, the city where he currently lives and works. He has exhibited widely and participated in numerous international exhibitions, including documenta IX in 1992; in 2003 he represented Portugal at the Venice Biennale. He has exhibited extensively across the globe including the current exhibition at the Power Plant in Toronto, Tate Modern, London (2013), Museu Colecção Berardo, Lisbon (2011), Museum for Contemporary Art, Leuven (2011), Carré d’Art, Nîmes (2010), Hamburger Kunsthalle (2009), Museo Tamayo, Mexico City (2009), Fondazione Merz, Torino (2008), Kunsthaus Graz (2008), Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rome (2006), Modern Art Center, Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon (2006), Kunsthalle Bern (2004) and Camden Arts Centre, London (2004). Deeply interested in nature, landscape, architecture and color, Cabrita Reis creates works marked by a highly individualized philosophical and poetic discourse. He uses simple materials that he recycles through constructive processes, using a suggestive power of association to explores issues of space, architecture and memory. ",545

Agent X,"Agent X is the creative alias of a talented American artist currently based in Vancouver who creates experimental multimedia collage art, paintings and 2D artworks. He does so by juxtaposing pop culture, technology, fashion, music, politics and race, a practice that results in visually stunning pieces of collage art that challenges its viewers to think deeply about what they are seeing. While his work draws from a rich formal training, Agent X's mash-up multimedia style is primarily self-developed and, therefore, completely unique.   Among other things, Agent X is known for his education which has provided him with a great foundation for creating art. His days as a student saw him studying in New Haven, Vancouver and Atlanta. What also makes Agent X so interesting to analyze is the incredible number of influences this man lists as pivotal inspirations in his work - he cites Takashi Murakami, Lada Alekseychuk, Romare Bearden, Peter Kennard, Wangechi Mutu, Robert Rauschenberg, Mimmo Rotella, Jacques Villeglé and Kara Walker. The works and techniques of all these artists seems to have combined and culminated into the art of Agent X.   Often described as a Pop artist with thought, Agent X juxtaposes pop culture, technology, fashion, music, politics and race in visually complex amalgamations expressing the anxieties of the global, post-modern world, the dark side of consumerism and media-obsessed culture. His work occupies a unique intersection between the aesthetics and philosophy of Futurism, the social critique of the Dada movement and contemporary artistic movements ranging from Pop Art to Superflat. Agent X often combines the ephemera of the past with the glossy world of contemporary magazines and newspapers, adding paint and other mixed media to create images that cleverly critique humanity’s current obsessions and where they are leading us.    When he was asked to explain his artistic pseudonym, Agent X stated the following: The name Agent X means that I am an agent of the unknown as my artwork is never the same, plus I feel that I am always on a mission to do art. In early American history, most black slaves were given the last name X. I honor them as well. Thus I am a slave to my art in a twisted way. It was also my music producer name back in the day. This somewhat surprising explanation is a valuable insight into this man's practice and it enables us to further analyze Agent X's art and truly understand it on all its creative levels.  ",547
Pieter Vermeersch,"The Belgian artist Pieter Vermeersch is best known as a painter, but his artistic practice takes him beyond the traditional boundaries of canvas.  Born in 1973, in Kortrijk, Belgium, Vermeersch lives and works in Brussels. He graduated from& HISK, Higher Institute for Fine Arts, Antwerp, Belgium and H.I.B.K., Higher Institute for Visual Arts, Sint-Lucas, Ghent, Belgium. His work was included in various exhibitions all around the world, including Barcelona, Bogota, New York and Tokyo, among others. Vermeersch questions and explores the parameters of painting and works on a variety of surfaces, such as canvas, marble, photographs, and existing architecture, using time, space and color as the three building blocks of his practice. Through his practice, he explores the relationship and the border between representation and abstraction. In addition to gradient wall paintings and immersive, painterly installations, where subverts territory whether conceived for an exhibition space or adjusted to a pre-existing architectural site, the artist also creates an array of ephemeral zero degree paintings on canvas, brought to a concrete reality by the irreversible process of chiseling and milling natural stone. Painting directly on the marble, he seeks to activate the temporal dimension that the material holds within. ",548
Nicolas Party,"American multidisciplinary artist Nicolas Party is known for his still life, landscapes, portraits, murals installations, and sculptures. The figurative painter creates work in soft pastel which gives him freedom and fluidity in his artistic expression. The depictions of body parts and busts allude to the remains of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. The Fauvist-hued landscapes are complex and layered, challenging the established purpose of the genre. The artist, whose work is sold for millions, has exhibited in cities all around the world, including Beijing, New York, Brussels, and Zürich. Today the artworks are part of numerous collections, including the K11 Art Foundation, the David Roberts Art Foundation, Museum Folkwang, the Rubell Museum, and the Sifang Art Museum in China.     Born in 1980 in Switzerland, Nicolas Party started creating graffiti in the 1990s. In 2004 he graduated from the Lausanne School of Art with a BA in Fine Art and later received an MA from Glasgow School of Art. The artist draws inspiration from the natural world, yet he does not create faithful depictions of it. Instead, while staying true to the combined legacies of 20th-century figurative painting, Classical antiquity, Romanticism, and Renaissance, he strips his subject of all inessential details. For example, in the figurative painting titled Portrait (2015), the subject's hair, neck and lips disappear into the bright red background. Free from all constraints of reality, Party is able to concentrate more on capturing the personality of the person.   The artist's sculptures and installations are executed in a rich pallet of vibrant colors. With a keen eye for compositions, Party explores the transformation and translations of nature through materials and color. Murals blended by hand distort the perspective and make it appear as if they expand beyond the borders of the image. In his seductive works, he explores the power of paint to alter how we perceive and experience art. Party often paints rocks with depictions of strangely shaped fruits. The practice of expanding beyond canvas on unconventional material fascinates him, for it allows him to examine both the materiality of the fruit and stone. The layering has always been part of the artist's practice, as can be seen in numerous exhibitions where a mural is a backdrop for a painting or sculpture. The process he named 'layer cake', he utilized to create the installation Magritte parti at Magritte Museum in Brussels in 2018.   In a recent exhibition titled Watercolor (2021) at Karma in New York, the artist showcased around 50 paintings that explore the fluid element of the paint. Inspired by the French artist Louis-Léopold Boilly, Party created murals, paintings, and sculptures for the exhibition Boilly at the Consortium Museum. Other notable exhibitions are HEADS AND CAVE showcased at the world's smallest museum, Kunsthalle Marcel Duchamp in Switzerland; Sottobosco (2020) at the Hauser & Wirth, Los Angeles; and mural Stage Fright at Kestnergesellschaft in Hannover (2021). Nicolas Party lives and works between New York and Brussels. ",549
Ernest Pignon-Ernest,"Ever since the 1960s, Ernest Pignon-Ernest could be seen wandering the streets of Paris, wheat pasting his monochromatic artworks which would carry inside them a strong political and social commentarie. This man is one of the most important initiators of urban and street art in France, alongside such sounding names as Daniel Buren and Gérard Zlotykam. When you consider just how beautiful and inspiring his work is, you wouldn't be far off if you said that Ernest Pignon-Ernest is the closest thing street art has to Classicism. Urban interventions of Pignon-Ernest are closely tied to concepts of French Fluxus and Situationism, so naturally the pieces he makes have a deep, strong inner meaning that may not be as easy to figure out as you may think.  Ernest was born in Nice, France, during the year of 1942. His first contact with art was a lot different when compared with his later, mature work - he began making architectural drawings on a the university in his hometown. This, however, served as an excellent basis upon which Ernest was able to build his ideas and concepts. Pignon-Ernest wanted to become an artist unlike any other that was before him, but he almost instantly ran up into his first obstacle. Luckily, it was an easily conquerable obstruction - there already was an artist with the name Ernest Pignon! Since the man in question was a well-known artist, there was a requirement for our Ernest to somehow alter his own name in order to distinguish himself. And that was the moment Ernest Pignon-Ernest was born, so to say. After he made sure there was no room for confusion with another French painter, it was the right time to start creating. Pignon-Ernest's work was usually based on his political views and it was them that served as fuel for his artistic expression - something that never truly changed as Ernest got older. The first street works were a direct reaction to France's involvement with the nuclear strike force on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These pieces were inspired by the horrific shadows on the walls left from people that were unfortunate enough to find themselves in these towns during this terrible moment at the end of The World War II. Although these Hiroshima and Nagasaki homage paying pieces were much darker then Pignon-Ernest's mature works, they were a good clue as to what will eventually be his trademark - Ernest has always tried to somehow capture the essence of a place inside his pieces. He draws from the history of the place, the memories it holds. The street art he creates can be interpreted as the artist's personal reactions to a location and things that occurred there. This may not seem like an original concept in street art today, but keep in mind that Pignon-Ernest used to develop these ideas way before this medium had a chance to establish himself. Therefore, all this artist managed to achieve was completely his own and new to the art scene.  When he was younger, Pignon-Ernest desired to follow in the footsteps of Pablo Picasso. The incredible innovations the legendary Spanish painter of Cubism brought to the table was simply a limitless source of inspiration for Ernest who wanted to make the same impact on the world. Ultimately, he realized that following Picasso's example meant he would be required to part ways with his own ideas and concepts. With a heavy heart, he decided not to pursue Cubistic designs and he turned towards Situationism, Fluxus and the aforementioned capturing of the essence inside locations. About the latter, Ernest Pignon-Ernest stated: Places are my essential materials. I try to understand, to grasp everything that can be seen there: space, light, colors and at the same time everything that cannot or can no longer be seen: history and buried memories. This is what I use to elaborate my images, which are thus born out of the places where I set them. The aim of this insertion is both to make the into a visual space and to work on its memories, to reveal, disrupt and heighten its symbolism. I do not make works in a given situation, I try to make works with situations. Ernest's interests and love for urban environments can definitely be attributed to his knowledge acquired during the studies of architecture. The artist himself explained it best himself: I always start with walking through a city, by day and night, trying to understand its organization, to comprehend its space, rhythm, color, texture, light, everything visible. Simultaneously, thanks to many meetings as well as the numerous books I have read, I give my best to see what is not visible (anymore) – history, memories that haunts some place, it's suggestive, poetic and symbolic power. Always wanting to open the eyes of the spectator to look at misery, poverty, immigration, racism, epidemics and other difficulties of a particular place he chose to work at, Pignon-Ernest brings to the surface forgotten histories, buried memories and politically informed remarks. As was mentioned in the opening paragraph, Ernest's technique is that of the wheat paste - a method in which a gel or liquid adhesive made from wheat flour or starch and water is used to hold posters and notices to walls.    Ultimately, all Pignon-Ernest knows about art he learned on his own - a pretty logical statement since he quit college before graduating and is responsible for establishing many original concepts of the 20th-century art. As was mentioned before, he is considered to be a Fluxus and Situationist artist. The first movement was connected to experimental syntheses of different artistic media and disciplines in which participants from fields as diverse as art, poetry, economics and chemistry produced performance events. Members of the Fluxus appreciated terms such as Neo-DaDa, anti-art and anti-commercial sensibility. Basically, they were believers in the new artistic ways and were interested in experimenting with established, traditional means of expression. The other side of Pignon-Ernest's artistic duality is, as was already said, the Situationism movement. The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from anti-authoritarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century, particularly Dada and Surrealism. Overall, situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of the mid 20th-century advanced capitalism. As Fluxus, it also focused a lot of attention towards performance events and changes within society. The combination of the two relatively similar but still very different art movements made Pignon-Ernest strive for blending various artistic medias and disciplines in the 1960s. All in all, it is true that if one wishes to understand the art of Ernest Pignon-Ernest, it is necessary to look closely towards his connection with Fluxus and the intellectual foundation of Situationist movement. Both of this movements had a toll on Ernest Pignon-Ernest’s aesthetics and his political consciousness.    Now widely considered to be a living legend of the street art scene, the immortality of Ernest Pignon-Ernest's work is pretty much guaranteed. The man proved to be a true urban art pioneer and it's virtually impossible to imagine that the street art movement would be the same today if Ernest, God forbid, choose to pursue the career of an architect or a Cubistic painter. Luckily for us, this was not the case and the artist paved a way for the generations of young French urban artists that wanted to state their opinions through interventions upon their city's surroundings.  The artist is represented by Artsuggest.com and Galerie Lelong Paris.

Swoon,"Swoon is a Brooklyn-based artist whose life-sized woodblock and cut-paper portraits hang on walls in various states of decay in cities around the world. She is also known as a designer of several large-scale installations, most notably the Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea in 2008. Her pieces have been collected by of The Museum of Modern Art, The Brooklyn Museum of Art, and the Tate Modern. Major pieces have appeared at PS1, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and Black Rat Press. Swoon has been traveling for the past several years creating exhibitions and workshops in the United States and abroad.  Swoon - Dawn and Gemma, 2014 - Courtesy of the Artist[/caption]  Swoon is known for being mysterious and modest – she didn’t want to tag her art in the beginning of her career. She felt best about working anonymously and worked that way until her boyfriend told her he had a dream in which the police was chasing two of them because they were writing graffiti and tagging them with the name Swoon. The artist taught that the sound of the name Swoon sounds nice and she accepted the suggestion of her boyfriend. A few years later, she indeed became recognized under that name. She found it funny that people believed she was a man and expected the Swoon-guy to do shows in their neighborhoods.   Swoon - Bangkok, 2014 - Courtesy of the Artist[/caption]  Swoon was born in New London, Connecticut but she moved to the Borough Park in Brooklyn, New York to study painting at the Pratt Institute. Around the same time, she has joined groups in New York City like Grub, which organize so-called free Dumpster-dived dinners. She is a very active young woman known for hosting various social events, such as a march through the Lower East Side consisting of a crowd playing instruments made from recycled garbage. Later on, after getting used to the NYC environment, she became an instigator and a collaborator. She founded the Toyshop collective and the Miss Rockaway Armada and is a member of Just Seeds and the Transformazium. Since 2006, she made a significant contribution to four large-scale raft events and floated down the Mississippi and Hudson rivers with them. In 2009, she and her collaborators designed a flotilla of sea-going rafts that invaded the 2009 Venice Biennale. When it comes to her artistic process, it is is based on the belief that art is an immersive, provocative, and transformative experience for its participants. Although Swoon’s aesthetics can be seen as an outgrowth of street art, her engagement with ethical living and making art share a close kinship with the idealism of off-grid, barter-based cultures and economies based on sharing. She uses scavenged and local materials and embraces print media as a potent means of action for social change. The majority of her street art consists of portraits. She believes that our bodies and faces store all of our experiences and that a portrait can become a deep insight into those experiences. She wants her portraits to depict the very essence of her subjects and hence she tries to emphasize something she loves or finds striking about her models and has seen in him or her.   Konbit Shelter is one of Swoon's environmentally engaged projects. It has begun in 2010 with the aim of raising consciousnesses and sharing resources through the building of homes in post-earthquake Haiti. Together with a group of artists, builders, and architects Swoon was working on building creatively designed structures meant to be resistant to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and fires. In December 2010, a community center and these small ecological shelters have been completed and people can inhabit them if needed.   In 2011, Swoon launched the Kickstarter project Dithyrambalina with the aim to erect a musical village in the heart of New Orleans. Since then Swoon has also spent the last couple of years creating monumental street art pieces and installations for MoCA Los Angeles, ICA Boston, NOMA New Orleans and MAC Oaxaca as well as on the streets of New York. Thanks to her unstoppable energy and inspiration, her projects that followed Dithyrambalina became well-known all over the United States and Mexico.    Swoon is a both humanitarian and artist who creates street art, installations, and sculptural assemblages in order to improve the world and make people happier and more content with their surroundings, both functionally and aesthetically. In 2015, after many successful projects, Swoon has founded a non-profit organization called The Heliotrope Foundation, in order to expand her community-based works in Haiti and New Orleans. The artist is represented by Hang-Up Gallery in London, Die Kunstagentin in Cologne and Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art in Miami.  ",551
Ai Weiwei,"With his personal circumstances moving in constant flux, Ai Weiwei, a Chinese artist, remains a cultural magnet. And nothing less than a worldwide phenomenon. A figure of Warholian celebrity (as labeled by New York Times), he is renowned for his political activism and social media activity almost as much as for his social interventions, approach to the readymade, and knowledge of Chinese traditional crafts. His oeuvre isn’t easily categorized, as he is an extremely creative and diverse individual, expressing his feelings and thoughts through sculptures, videos, installations, and performances. However, his fame extends throughout and beyond the art world. A master at communicating powerful ideas in astonishingly few words, Ai Weiwei is known for his innovative use of social media to disseminate his views. With works that touch on topics such as imprisonment, borders, and disaster, the artist has often found himself in conflict with the Chinese authorities. Today, he’s an artist of global stature, whose strong social conscience has galvanized a generation of Chinese artists, but also numerous others throughout the globe.  Ai Weiwei was born in Beijing. His father was the Chinese poet Ai Qing, who was denounced during the Anti-Rightist Movement due to his poetry. In 1958, the family was sent to a labor camp in Beidahuang, Heilongjiang, when the artist was just one-year-old. They were subsequently exiled to Shihezi, Xinjiang in 1961, where they lived for 16 years. Upon Mao Zedong’s death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the family returned to Beijing in 1976. Ai Weiwei began his training at Beijing Film Academy. In 1978, he was one of the founders of the early avant-garde art group the “Stars”, together with Ma Desheng, Wang Keping, Huang Rui, Li Shuang, Zhong Acheng and Qu Leilei. The group disbanded in 1983, yet Ai participated in regular Stars group shows, The Stars: Ten Years, 1989 (Hanart Gallery, Hong Kong and Taipei), and a retrospective exhibition in Beijing in 2007: Origin Point (Today Art Museum, Beijing).  He spent the years between 1983 and 1993 in New York. A decade spent in the USA, a country that promised Chinese artists freedom from the repressions they faced in their homeland, helped in shaping his style and set the stage for his future career as an artist. He lived in a tiny apartment in New York's East Village and was an active member of the neighborhood's arts scene.[1] There he continued his education at the Parsons School of Design and was instrumental in the founding of the Overseas Chinese Artists Foundation as well as laying the groundwork for experimental artists in the East Village where he published three books about the future generation of artists. The artist finds inspiration not only in the contemporaneity but his own personal memories as well.   In 2006, even though he could barely type, Ai Weiwei started blogging. For more than three years, he turned out a steady stream of scathing social commentary, criticism of government policy, thoughts on art and architecture, and autographical writings.[2] He wrote about the Sichuan earthquake (and posted a list of the schoolchildren who died because of the government's ""tofu-dregs engineering""), reminisced about Andy Warhol and the East Village art scene, described the irony of being investigated for ""fraud"" by the Ministry of Public Security, made a modest proposal for tax collection. Weiwei’s engagement over Sichuan province earthquake included assembling a team, going on the spot, information and filming the area – a direct response to government’s intransparency regarding this natural disaster, and its resistance to publicly announce the names of students that died during the earthquake, with the poor construction of students’ campuses being one of the main reasons for their deaths. The artist and his team gathered more than 5,000 names before Chinese authorities shut down his blog on June 1, 2009. Later that year, he was beaten by the police, when he tried to testify for one member of his investigating team. After this beating, Ai Weiwei was experiencing frequent headaches and complained of his sudden inability to concentrate. He went to Germany, where he was diagnosed with internal bleeding, and where he had an emergent brain surgery.  The artist was arrested by the Chinese authorities while catching a plane from Beijing to Hong Kong back in April 2011. He was held in prison for almost three months – at first, it was stated by a Chinese state media that Ai Weiwei was arrested due to the incomplete departure procedures, and only later it was announced that Ai Weiwei was imprisoned during the investigation for “alleged economic crimes”. After 81 days in prison, Ai Weiwei was released, but the Chinese authorities have kept his passport and he was unable to leave the country. The answer to the question ‘why he was arrested in the first place’ probably originates in the long history of the artist’s criticism pointed toward the government, and yet, the authorities accused him of tax fraud. They stated that his company – the Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd. – had allegedly evaded $1.85 million worth of taxes and intentionally destroyed accounting documents. But, according to information that came from Ai Weiwei’s family, the Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd. is officially registered in his wife’s name, and Ai Weiwei is not the legal representative of this design company, nor is he the CEO. During the time he was unable to leave the country, Weiwei began one of his best-known performances. More precisely, With Flowers, part-performance and part-protest began on November 30, 2013, more than two years since the start of his confinement. The artist placed a fresh bouquet of flowers in the basket of a bicycle in front of his studio in Beijing and action of endured for about 600 days. In July of 2015, Ai Weiwei finally got his passport back, after four years during which he missed more than 200 exhibitions featuring his work and numerous other events.  Without going into the politics behind Syrian conflict (which has lasted for almost six years now), we can only shake our heads in disbelief as we see just how many people’s lives have been lost and how many destroyed. Countless faceless and nameless men, women, and children, barely escaping from becoming a collateral damage in the war, tried finding a safe place in Europe. Ai Weiwei has recognized the gravity of the situation and has been involved in the European refugee crisis for many months now. He is constantly criticizing the European and the global response to the crisis. As he recently told The Guardian: “These people have nothing to do with Europe; they are like people from outer space, but they have to come. They have been pushed out and they are being totally neglected by Europe. They are sleeping in the mud and rain and it is only volunteers giving them food or clothes.”[3] The artist has described the EU-Turkey deal as illegal and immoral, shameful, underlining the fact it’s not a solution, but a source for further problems (EU-Turkey agreement allow the Greek and EU FRONTEX border teams to stop the influx of refugees into Greece, forcing them back to Turkey, while the European countries would accept refugees from Turkey based on quota system agreed among the EU member states. Turkey received billions of Euros as aid). He visited refugee camp Idomeni in Northern Greece, where thousands of people are trapped after the so-called Balkan Route was closed. Ai pulled his works out of Denmark when the Danish parliament passed the law allowing the authorities to confiscate valuables and cash from migrants in order to cover the cost of their care. He set up a studio on the Greek island of Lesvos (also known as Lesbos), stating: “This is a very historical moment from any perspective. As an artist I want to be more involved, I want to create artworks in relation to the crisis and also create some kind of consciousness about the situation.” In September of 2015, body of a 3-year old Syrian boy refugee, Alan Kurdi, surfaced on a beach near the Turkish town of Bodrum. The heartbreaking photograph captured this haunting moment of the lifeless infant who drowned and was left there on the beach, lying face down in the sand. An image, as powerful and impactful such as this one, became a symbol of the refugees’ plight and struggle they have to overcome in order to escape the horrors of their own homeland and reach a new and hopefully better world. Ai Weiwei posed on the Mediterranean beach as the Syrian boy, lying face down on the beach, in an attempt to remind the world of the plight of the people making their way to Europe. Many have praised Ai’s humanitarian activism in Cycladic islands and in mainland Greece. From the artist’s statement, we can conclude that he is really involved in migrant crisis as a humanitarian, not only as an artist. As he said: “People are being selfish, very greedy, short-sighted and ridiculous. This is not a regional problem; it is a human problem. The bad guys are everywhere, but also the good guys are. We have to trust in humanity but not trust in politicians.”[4] However, there are some voices criticizing his art engagement in relation to the refugee crisis, accusing him of using the situation (especially the posing as a drowned boy) for strengthening his celebrity status. On the other hand, many critics are saying that his activism damages his art. Those who are critically oriented towards Ai’s activism are also critical about the artist’s idea to make a feature length documentary which he plans for cinema release (a film about the refugees). But, that is how protest art functions. Someone might dislike it, but nobody can deny the enormous potential art and celebrity artists have to raise awareness about injustice, humanitarian crisis, wars, and other violent events.   With an active role in the refugee crisis and other socially responsible activities, it is almost easy to forget Ai Weiwei’s more traditional form of art expression. We’re speaking, of course, about his sculptures. His work is highly influenced by Chinese tradition, political and social issues, relations between past and present, and so on. But, probably the most important feature of his art is his attempt to spread social messages through the beautiful artworks he creates. When it comes to sculpture, he is probably one of the most innovative artists in the world, pushing the boundaries of today's sculpture practice. In Coca-Cola Vase, he has displayed a conflict between the progression of the modern and the preservation of traditional - what else could be said about the sculpture where we see a Twentieth Century logo festooned upon a two-thousand-year-old vase? The emblem of American capitalism is emblazoned on an ancient Chinese artifact, a unique hand-crafted object adorned with the ornament of mass-production. Deeply conceptualized, this artwork poses many questions: the relationship between consumerism and traditional way of life, between American capitalism and Chinese “one state-two models” system, new and old. In Grapes, the sculptor wove together 32 Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) stools in a semi-spherical bowl. He has asserted that these three-legged stools are a fundamental expression of the aesthetic of rural China; they can be found in every countryside home, often passed down through the generations. By giving stools a completely unique form, Ai Weiwei points to the potency and rapidity of the social, economic, political, and artistic changes facing China in the 21st century. In the Gold version of Circle of Animals / Zodiac Heads, the artist has reinterpreted the twelve gold animal heads representing the traditional Chinese zodiac that once adorned the famed fountain-clock of the Yuanming Yuan, an imperial retreat in Beijing.   The need for honesty has never been bigger than today. The world is absurd, stupid and cruel, and people who dare speak against it are often silenced. It takes a certain level of courage and spite to resist those who oppress the weaker. Ai Weiwei is a shining example and his never-ending pursuit of honesty and fairness has been recognized by many. In the world whose negativity seems endless, where our hearts are broken just by watching the news and seeing images around the globe, the hope is a necessity. A hope that some things may get better. The artist provides a glimpse of that hope! Famed for his tongue in cheek criticisms, his satires of traditional culture and his strong sense of social responsibility, Ai Weiwei is always ready to raise his voice against injustice, oppression, war and everything that hurts those unable to defend themselves. And he is not going to stop, as long as he feels he’s making a difference, as long the world needs someone to stand up and speak up. Because of all above-mentioned, Ai Weiwei is our Artist of the Year 2016! He is represented by Verso Contemporary Art and Kunzt Gallery.   References:  ",552
Robert Mapplethorpe,"With his name forged on the list of the most era-defining artists coming from the 20th century, Robert Mapplethorpe was an American photographer known for his controversial, large-scale, highly stylized black and white images that literally changed the medium of modern photography. His arguably perfect portfolio featured a wide array of subjects and themes, including celebrity portraits, male and female nudes, self-portraits and still-life images. His most provocative work by far is that of the underground bondage and sadomasochistic scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The strong note of homoeroticism inside this project fuelled a national dispute over the public funding of controversial artwork and to this day remains as one of the strongly debated subjects of contemporary art. The life and work of Robert Mapplethorpe was a true cornerstone of the modern photography and the medium was never quite the same after he changed it for good.  Robert was born during the year of 1946 in Floral Park, Queens. As the artist himself stated, it was a quiet place to grow up in - perhaps too quiet, if you go by the Mapplethorpe' words: I come from suburban America. It was a very safe environment and it was a good place to come from in that it was a good place to leave. When he was about nineteen years of age, it came a time for him to move away from home. In 1963, he started studying at the prestigious Pratt Institute in nearby Brooklyn, where he studied drawing, painting, and sculpture, but mostly focused on Graphic Art as this was his major subject. Although considered a successful student, due to some unfortunate circumstances and disagreements, he dropped out of the Institute before he was able to graduate. Influenced by artists such as Joseph Cornell and Marcel Duchamp, Mapplethorpe spent his college years experimenting with a large variety of materials and sources in mixed-media collages - usually pictures he cut out of magazines and newspapers. In 1970, a year that will prove to be a real landmark for Mapplethorpe and his career, he bought a Polaroid camera and began taking his own photos, incorporating them into the aforementioned collage pieces. Robert was delighted with the results and stated that producing collages this way felt a lot more honest compared to the techniques he used earlier.  Mapplethorpe quickly found satisfaction taking Polaroid photographs independently from mixed-media and soon he stopped incorporating them into collage pieces - as a matter of fact, it seems that photos took precedent over his collages as he started devoting one hundred percent of his time to taking them. In 1970, the same year when Robert started to take more serious photographs, the artist moved into the Manhattan’s Chelsea Hotel with Patti Smith, Mapplethorpe's girlfriend he knew for about three years at the time. The two were in a complicated on-and-off love relationship but still represented each other's greatest supporters in terms of artistic expressions. Soon after moving in the hotel, Robert's career took off in a great fashion. In 1973, the Light Gallery in New York City organized Robert Mapplethorpe's first solo gallery exhibition, simply titled as Polaroids. It was an absolute success. Two years later, he obtained a professional Hasselblad medium-format camera and began taking images of his close circle of friends and acquaintances, all of whom were an artistic story in their own right - musicians, socialites, pornographic film stars and members of the S&M underground. Robert Mapplethorpe started to make quite a name for himself and was building a reputation of a rebel artist that lives for his uncompromising work. During the early 1970s, Robert frequently worked on commercial projects, designing album covers for Patti Smith's music records and creating a series of portraits for the Interview Magazine - a newspaper established by the legendary Andy Warhol.  In the second half of the 1970s, Robert Mapplethorpe's career was going nowhere but up. In 1977, he participated in Documenta 6 in Kassel, West Germany and in 1978, the Robert Miller Gallery in New York City became his exclusive dealer. And as he was quickly becoming a bigger star, Mapplethorpe's portfolio started to stand out as some of the most characteristic work out there. He stubbornly stuck to the black and white images which became his trademark by then. After he took a few pictures of the iconic Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1976, Mapplethorpe did a series on Lisa Lyon, the first World Women's Bodybuilding Champion. This was just a beginning of their collaborations - over the next several years they worked on a series of portraits and figure studies, a film and a book.  At the end of the 70s, already very famous Mapplethorpe grew increasingly interested in documenting the New York S&M scene, a great taboo subject at the time. The resulting photographs were shocking for their content and remarkable for their technical mastery. Throughout the late 70s and early 80s, Mapplethorpe produced a pack of images that simultaneously challenged and adhered to classical aesthetic standards - his work was provocative and controversial, but at the same time incorporated stylized compositions of male and female nudes, delicate flower still lifes and studio portraits that looked straight out of some photographic academy. Meanwhile, his career continued to flourish and it was impossible to be a photography fan and not run into his name everywhere you looked. Robert introduced and refined different techniques and formats, including color 20"" x 24"" Polaroids, photogravures, platinum prints on paper and linen, Cibachrome and dye transfer color prints - and achieved all this in less than a decade.  While much of Mapplethorpe’s work was considered erotically explicit and unconventional, he also became renowned for a classic sensibility in his choices regarding light, shadow and shape in black and white. He became a true master of such balances that made his portfolio instantly recognizable. During the mid-eighties, he designed sets for Lucinda Childs' performance act Portraits in Reflection, created a photogravure series for Arthur Rimbaud's A Season in Hell and was commissioned by curator Richard Marshall to take portraits of New York artists. Unfortunately, the wild style of life simply caught up with him - Robert Mapplethorpe became a victim of the much feared and relatively unknown illness at the time, as he was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986. Despite his disease, the time Mapplethorpe spent with the dire diagnosis was the most active of his already perfect career. He accelerated his creative efforts, broadened the scope of his photographic inquiry and accepted increasingly challenging commissions. Although it may seem logical that an artist's work should become a lot darker in such circumstances, his images did not change that much during this time as they remained almost identical to the works before he was diagnosed with AIDS. The Whitney Museum of American Art mounted his first major American museum retrospective in 1988, a hugely successful exhibition organized almost one year before Robert's death in 1989. After much struggle, Mapplethorpe died on the morning of March 9, 1989, 42 years old, in Boston, Massachusetts. His body was cremated and the ashes buried in Queens, New York, in his mother's grave, marked Maxey.   Robert Mapplethorpe is widely recognized as a giant of the late century photography and today his perfect legacy is represented by several established galleries around the world, while his work can be found in the collections of some of the most important international museums dedicated to his medium. Besides the straight-out artistic and social aspects of his work, Mapplethorpe's influence on today's photography scene lives on through the work of the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, an organization the artist personally helped establish in 1988. Robert's vast, provocative, era-defining and powerful body of work has confirmed him as one of the most important artists of the twentieth century - as well as one of the first stops for any aspiring photographers that wish to be introduced to the artistic peaks of the medium.

Tom Wesselmann,"Widely considered as one of the major artists of the New York Pop Art, Tom Wesselmann was an American artist best known for his stylized female nudes which were the definite focal points of his career as a painter. Due to his enormous contributions to the aforementioned Pop art, it comes as no surprise that Wesselmann's name is often found alongside Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. However, it should be stated right away that, just like the case was with Jim Dine, Wesselmann disagreed with the label of a Pop artist on a conceptual level. Tom, in an effort to reject Abstract Expressionism, made collages and assemblages that incorporated everyday objects and advertising ephemera. Although his field of art making is extremely broad and diverse, Wesselmann is arguably best known for his Great American Nude works produced during the 1960s - this highly sexualised series featured flat figures in an intense palette of red, white, blue and other patriotic colors often associated with the United States of America.  Wesselmann was born and raised in the city of Cincinnati. After what was a very happy childhood, he spent two years at the Hiram College in Ohio before transferring to major in Psychology at the University of Cincinnati. Since he was drafted into service by the US Army in 1952, Tom had a lot of spare time on his hand from the moment he was stationed stateside. It was during this time that he made his first cartoons and became interested in pursuing a career in illustrating. After returning home, Wesselmann began to study drawing at the Art Academy of Cincinnati and achieved some initial success, like selling his first cartoon strips to the magazines 1000 Jokes and True. Tom soon came to live in NYC and after a visit to the MoMA, he was inspired by the Robert Motherwell painting Elegy. This fascination drove Wesselmann to reject the ideas of action painting, but it also transformed him into a painter instead of a cartoonist. In the meantime, Wesselmann became one of the founding members of the Judson Gallery alongside a few friends who had just arrived in New York[1]. Tom's series Great American Nude, begun during the year of 1961, first brought him to the attention of the art world. This series was extremely patriotic in nature as the artist focused on the use of American red, white and blue. Images also incorporated other representational depictions of patriotic themes such as American landscape photos and portraits of founding fathers. The pictures from the Great American Nude were mostly collaged from magazines and discarded posters, which called for a much larger format than Wesselmann had used previously in his career. These pieces were also the ones to be displayed at Tom's first solo exhibition at the Tanager Gallery. Soon Wesselmann became a vital part of the Pop art scene and started both collaborating and exchanging ideas with the prominent artists of the new movement.    After he successfully established himself as one of the leading artists in NYC, Tom began to teach art at a public school in Brooklyn and later at the High School of Art and Design. As was clued at earlier, Wesselmann never liked his inclusion in the wrongly termed Pop Art, pointing out how he made an aesthetic use of everyday objects and not a criticism of them as consumer objects. Tom explained his unsatisfaction by stating the following: I dislike labels in general and 'Pop' in particular, especially because it overemphasizes the material used. There does seem to be a tendency to use similar materials and images, but the different ways they are used denies any kind of group intention. Ultimately, Wesselmann managed to reduce the classical female nude to her most essential components of lips, nips and pubes, underlined by a strong note of sexualism. After the success of the Great American Nude, Tom began working on a series of still lifes, experimenting with the potentials of assemblage. Although he conceptually distanced himself from the Pop art term, Wesselmann maintained his connections with the evolution of the movement, as evidenced by the event The American Supermarket held at the Bianchini Gallery in New York during the year of 1964[2]. Tom continued to experiment with his art for the next five decades, exploring the abilities of collage, limitations of assemblage and general range of his Pop-like concepts. Additionally, Wesselman was a self-confessed fan of country music and sometimes incorporated operating radios, TVs or other sound elements into his standards artworks. He also introduced new ideas on color, proved his ability to construct the composition and displayed the constant tendency towards new materials - all the while maintaining his highly sexual and colorful style. Whilst working on a throw-back series of Sunset Nudes in 2003/4, Wesselmann suddenly had severe complications with his already unstable heart condition. Following a failed surgery, Tom died on December 17, 2004, alone in his hospital bedroom. His life and work were a crucial study of Pop art, although his painting did not have anything to do with the style of Andy Warhol and other representatives of the movement.   As is usually the case, the years following Wesselmann’s death were marked by a sudden and renewed interest in his life and work. Many retrospective shows were held and Tom's contributions to the Pop art evolution were finally brought to full light, despite his regular protest against the membership in this movement. Wesselmann’s legacy was secured whilst his Venuses with tan lines, cigarettes dangling from their rocket-red mouths and modern nudes sprawling across furniture in suggestive poses effectively entered art history. Ultimately, after all was said and done, it comes as no surprise that the legendary Jim Dine once stated that Tom may very well be one of America's greatest modern painters to date[3].

Chuck Close,"A major figure of the 20th and 21st-century painting, Chuck Close is an American artist known for his monumental portraits which are rendered with exquisite realism taken from photographic sources. His large-scale pieces are some of the greatest examples photorealism has to offer from its artistic arsenal. Playing with ideas of scale, color and form, Close has become additionally famous for his fabulous compositions which, although abstract up close, form unified and highly lifelike images when looked from afar. Besides this Impressionism-like practice, Chuck is also active in the field of photography. It should also be noted that Close suffers from an inability to recognize faces - an interesting fact that sheds new light on his painting method. Chuck also suffers from partial paralyzation, a result of a spinal injury that occurred in 1988.  Chuck Close was born in the year of 1940 in Monroe, a city in Snohomish County of Washington. His father's name was Leslie Durward Close and he died when his son was eleven years of age. As a consequence, Chuck was raised by his mother, Mildred Wagner Close. While he was still a toddler, Chuck suffered from a neuromuscular condition that made it difficult to lift his feet off the ground. Furthermore, he had a prolonged issue with nephritis that kept him out of school for most of the sixth grade. However, this was not the end of the problems for the small child - he also had dyslexia which was not diagnosed for most of his school days, heavily affecting his achievements as a student. As a mean of escape from such a troubling reality, young Chuck Close turned his attention to making art. Most of his early works are very large portraits based on photographs of family members and close friends. These pieces can be observed as announcers of his future work as Chuck Close never changed his subject - he only got a lot better with his technique.  As if his other issues were not enough, Chuck was diagnosed with prosopagnosia, an illness which is better known by its layman's name of face blindness. Although this kind of disability would probably make most of us stay well clear from painting portraits, this was not the case with Close. Furthermore, the artist claims that it was this problem that inspired him to do portraits in the first place. Noticing that her son was at his happiest when he was painting, Mildred Wagner Close supported her son's creative endeavors. She would take him to museums and art shows, all in order to make sure her son does not lose interest in painting. The artist recalled such a memory during an interview he did with The Brooklyn Rail. In it, Close stated the following: I went to the Seattle Art Museum with my mother for the first time when I was 14. I saw this Jackson Pollock drip painting with aluminum paint, tar, gravel and all that stuff. I was absolutely outraged, disturbed. It was so far removed from what I thought art was. However, within 2 or 3 days, I was dripping paint all over my old paintings. In a way, I've been chasing that experience ever since. Pursuing a career in painting, Close started attending classes at the Everett Community College in the year of 1958.   In the year of 1962, Close received his B.A. from the University of Washington in Seattle. He entered the graduate degree program at Yale University during the same year, an institution where he received his MFA in the year of 1964. After Yale, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna for a while on a Fulbright grant, enjoying Austria's well-organized presentation of European art history. After he returned to the soil of the United States, Close worked as an art teacher, giving lectures on a regular basis at the University of Massachusetts. Close came to New York City in the year of 1967 and established himself as a worthy artist in SoHo, a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan which came to the public's attention in recent history for being the location of many artists' lofts and galleries. Here, Chuck expanded his contribution to portraiture by mastering varied drawing and painting techniques, such as ink, graphite, pastel, watercolor, conté crayon, finger painting and stamp-pad ink on paper. Furthermore, Close worked with printmaking, exploring such techniques as etching, woodcuts, linocuts and silkscreens. He also used to create paper collage artworks, Polaroid photographs, Daguerreotypes and Jacquard tapestries. Interestingly, Close's early airbrush techniques directly inspired the development of the inkjet printer, a type of computer printing that recreates a digital image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper, plastic, or other substrates. Close's method was surprisingly simple when put into words, but make no mistake as this is a complex process. Chuck would first put a grid on the photo as well as on the canvas, later continuing to slowly copy cell by cell to its finest detail. His later work branched into non-rectangular grids, topographic map style regions of similar colors and CMYK color grid pieces.   In the year of 1967, Chuck Close made a choice to make art hard for himself and force an individualistic artistic breakthrough by completely abandoning the paintbrush, turning to other methods of creative expression. The painter explained such a radical decision with the following statement: I chose to do things I had no facility with. The choice not to do something is in a funny way more positive than the choice to do something. If you impose a limit to not do something you've done before, it will push you to where you've never gone before. Soon, Close started working with a gridded photograph, building his images by applying one careful stroke after another. This methodical way of building a composition resulted in huge pieces which were highly focused. As a reaction, the New York City accepted photography which became assimilated into the art scene thanks to the works of Chuck Close, as well as pieces made by artists such as Richard Estes, Denis Peterson and Audrey Flack. Such artworks also had a massive impact on the development of Photorealism which will soon be accepted as a valid style within art history.   On the 7th of December in 1988, Close was at a ceremony praising local artists in New York City and was waiting the moment he would be called to the podium to present an award. However, he felt a strange pain in his chest. Chuck was able to deliver his speech but suffered a seizure which left him paralyzed from the neck down. As soon as he arrived in a hospital, the cause was diagnosed as a spinal artery collapse. Unfortunately, there was nothing the doctors could do at that point. Close called that day The Event. For the next following months, Chuck was in rehab strengthening his muscles with physical therapy. The therapy was partially successful as the painter regained slight movement in his arms and could walk for a bit. However, he was bound to a wheelchair ever since. Yet this terrifying event was not able to have a crucial impact on his art - Close continued to paint with a brush strapped to his wrist with tape, creating large portraits in low-resolution grid squares with the help of an assistant. This was the time Chuck abandoned his photorealistic ideals altogether, although this process was well underway before The Event. Since then, Close started to turn completely to semi-abstraction as he adopted the aforementioned technique in which the composition is abstract up close, but forms a highly lifelike image when looked from afar. Since his life was altered so much, Close's art flourished, to say the least. He collaborated with many artists and made portrait pieces out of many of them, such as Kara Walker. His work continued to set standards and he is now well regarded as one of the most influential living artists in the United States of America. In 2000, Chuck Close was the recipient of the National Medal of Arts which was handed to him by the president himself. The artist also received the New York State Governor's Art Award, the Skowhegan Arts Medal and over 20 honorary degrees including one from Yale University. In the year of 2010, Close was appointed by Barack Obama to the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities.   Although it is easily possible to connect Close with the ideas of Conceputal art, his greatest contributions to art history are without a doubt his photorealistic portraits. Never before had there been such realistic depictions placed on a canvas and combining that fact with knowing Close is not physically able to distinguish faces makes his work that much more impressive. Another occurrence concerning Chuck's life and work makes us feel extremely lifted and inspired. The fact he has been able to stay undeterred after his severe injuries and the way he adapted his art to the limitations placed before him makes Close one of the most awe-inspiring chapters of modern art history. He is a living and breathing proof that there surely is no excuse nor obstacle if one sets his mind in the right direction.

Wifredo Lam,"The astonishing body of work of Wilfredo Lam represents complex practice interwoven with both purely artistic topics and philosophical and political aspirations. He was the fertile painter, well connected and recognized on the international scale and such a reputation was followed by the continuity of his painterly practice with several departures to ceramics and sculpture in his late years. The way Lam constructed his oeuvre by drawing inspiration from spiritual traditions of Southern America, socialism and modernist trends of the time, ranked him as one of the most authentic and progressive artist’s of the first half of the twentieth century.  Wifredo Óscar de la Concepción Lam y Castilla or Wifredo Lam was born on December 8, 1902, in a village of Sagua La Grande, in Cuba. Yam Lam, the artist’s father, was a Chinese immigrant while his mother Ana Serafina Castilla descended from Congolese slave mother and Cuban mulatto father. That origin made him not only of a mixed race, yet he was exposed to diverse cultural influences in terms of Catholicism and African spiritual practices, which respectively became the central motif of his work. At the age of 14, Lam moved to Havana to study law according to a desire of his family. In parallel, he became involved in a tropical plants course at the Botanical Gardens, and at the Escuela de Bellas Artes studied painting from 1918 to 1923 when suddenly he was fed up with the academy and fled to Madrid.   In Madrid Lam’s teacher was the famous artist Fernando Zaragoza, who taught Salvador Dali and was the curator at the Museo del Prado. The artist was a bit torn between academy classes and painters with whom he spends the rest of the time, but that did not in any way disrupted his artistic development. The works of Lam at the time merged from being rich and saturated to being simple, yet decorative. While in Spain Lem got acquainted with Eva Piriz and soon she became his wife, but sadly both she and their young son died in 1931 of tuberculosis, and this event certainly reflected on his work.   Wifredo Lam was exposed to various works of art at the Prado Museum, from Hieronymus Bosch to Henri Matisse, as well as latest tendencies embodied in Surrealism. Apparently full of compassion and aware of social inequality which was related to his own background, the artist was quite moved by the hard lives of Spanish peasants and became involved in Spanish Civil War. During that period he produced posters for Republican army but was severely injured and transferred to Barcelona. Out there through some friends, he was introduced with Pablo Picasso. Lam moved to Paris in 1938 and then met Georges Braque, Juan Miro and other relevant artists from that circle.   Shortly after being introduced to art dealer Pierre Loeb, Lam had a chance to prepare his first Paris exhibition in 1939. The influence of Cubism became more and more apparent in his work, and the same year he showed his works together with Picasso in Pels Gallery in New York. After a year, on the very beginning of World War II, Lem left to Marseille due to the German occupation of Paris where he meets Andre Breton and started working with him. It was a publication of Breton’s poem Fata Morgana which was edited with Lem’s drawings. In 1941 after being prosecuted by vicious Vichy regime a large number of intellectuals boarded the ship to the island of Martinique and they were immediately interned at the Lazaret camp, where they spent over a month. Interestedly, though the situation was rather inconvenient it served as a perfect setting to imprint and modify ideas of Surrealism according to pagan and animist traditions of Africa.   Soon afterward, the return to Cuba marked Lam’s unique work as a conjecture of several influences besides before mentioned Magic Realism, Cubism, Surrealism there was an imprint of Primitivism which was not surprising since of his culturally diverse background. The tradition of Caribbean and African symbolism accentuated with the references to Santeria, a hybrid religion practiced in the Caribbean, after the return to Cuba became the focal motif of his work. In that period the artist started examining that tradition with a help of Lydia Cabrera, an anthropologist and specialist in the Afro-Cuban culture who was on a task of preserving the heritage of ancestors. From the begging of his career Lam painted still life’s, landscapes and figural compositions, but as the series of paintings that he produced from 40’s onwards show increasing representations of anthropomorphic figures which due to a course of time became fully hybrids, like goodly creatures shaped out of human, animal and plants parts.[1]   In 1943 Wifredo Lam produced perhaps one of his most respectable works called symbolically The Jungle. This humongous canvas seems to obtain a summary of Lam’s intimate thoughts and persuasions. The narrative represents intensity and density of Afro-Cuba religions and, on one side, it seems as if it celebrates the openness of human mind, as well as the dark corners of imagination which can be a direct comment on the global political state of the time. The ambiguity of the composition makes it so exceptional primarily because it exposes the viewer to outstanding execution of artistic practice in aesthetical, social and political context. The curiosity is that the painting was for many years installed on ground floor of the New York’s prestige MOMA, next to the coatroom, so there was a controversy regarding the work being marginalized because it did not fit within colonial and exclusive discourse of Western art, which tells much about the reception of the arts of the Others.   Lam was quite supportive of the changes in his homeland, so decided to exhibit at Havana University in 1955 due to student protests against the authoritarian regime. After the change came the artist remained loyal to communist ideas and his painting El Tercer Mundo (The Third World) was produced for the president Castro’s palace. In the 60’s Lam moved to Italy with his wife Lou Laurin, a Swedish painter, and their children. That period of his life was followed by a large number of retrospective exhibitions and awards, while the artist decides to work with a media of pottery and sculpture and by the end of 70’s Wifredo Lam’s reputation became confirmed on the international scale.   The way he has merged artistic ideas and ideological beliefs with the everlasting need to articulate his own position shows an immense effort to fight the prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Therefore, it can be said that his stylistically hybrid practice was based on agenda of emancipation and sensitivity for diversity. Last year Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris hosted a huge retrospective exhibition of his works which then traveled to the Reina Sofia Museum in Spain and the Tate Museum in London afterward and this year the restrospective was held in Tate Museum.[2] Finally, the relevance of showing his work is largely based on Wifredo Lam’s efforts to promote and interpret different cultural models and heritage which marks him as perhaps one of the brightest examples of engaged art in the context of Southern America. Wifredo Lam died on September 11, 1982, in Paris. Refernces: ",556
Joe Webb,"Joe Webb is a British visual artist known for his enticing handmade mixed media collages. He uses images from vintage magazines and posters to conjure surreal narratives that express both a comical and cynical take on the modern world.  Born in 1976, Webb worked as a commercial artist and graphic designer for several years. Tired of modern technology and its overwhelming potentials, Joe turned to collage, a technique he described as ""more immediate and graphic than painting"". Webb’s elegant handmade collages are made of vintage magazines and printed ephemera that he has collected during the years. Without Photoshop manipulation, combining only two or three elements in each piece, Webb re-invents the imagery taken from his collection of prints to create simple and elegant, yet surreal, images that explore themes such as global warming, consumerism, war, drought, famine, and others. Webb reinterprets the imagery using simple and concise edits, transforming the original scene into his version of what is going on in the world, all without the aid of computers. The central figure or object in Joe’s pieces is often displaced into an unusual setting, holding a mirror up to conflicting cultures and experiences.    Combining and removing imagery from vintage color schemes with decades-old advertising conventions Joe Webb creates a nostalgic visual effect, taking the viewer backward, first, yet after a few seconds the current importance of the collages’ subject matter comes into full view. In Web’s piece titled TV Times, 2014, the artist depicts the stereotypical 1940s/’50s nuclear family unit sitting outside and watching the eruption of a volcano on their personal television, while the it is happening just behind them. Thus, Webb is showing the ironies of present-day society’s obsession with screens and experiencing the world through them, even when actual events are precariously nearby. Using as a medium magazines from the 1950s and 1960s, Joe also reminds the viewer of the post-production filters and tones used in social networks such as Instagram.  Many of Joe’s artworks wittily examine human relationships and our perplexing position in the universe. In Stirring up a Storm, 2014, a continent-sized electric mixer from the 1950s, Sunbeam Mixmaster Junior, stirs Earth’s atmosphere with its twin silver beaters to create massive, hurricane-like weather patterns. At first sight, issues of global warming and energy crises come to mind, however, the well-crafted humor, imaginative aesthetic, and a subtly wry irreverence ensure that his message is successfully notified.   Joe Webb’s piece Kissing Magritte is the homage to a Belgian surrealist artist René Magritte who influenced the artist’s work. Webb presents Magritte's signature clouds in this screen printed collage by removing the bowler hat wearing gentleman's face.  Although Webb is primarily drawn to images from the 1950s and avoids digital photo processing in his practice, his work has become incredibly popular thanks to modern technology. Joe has participated in numerous solo and group shows in galleries and art fairs, including the Saatchi Gallery, London, and Christie’s Contemporary Art Gallery.  Joe Webb lives and works in Brighton, UK.   ",557
Patrick Wilson,"Patrick Wilson is an American artist known for his luminous, sumptuously colored abstract paintings composed of lines and quadrilaterals. Born in Redding, California in 1970, Patrick earned his BFA from the University of California, Davis in 1993 and his Masters of Fine Art degree from Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, California in 1995.  Patrick Wilson’s abstract paintings are composed of richly layered geometric forms—lines, squares, and rectangles. Conceived with the ideas of beauty and pleasure at the forefront, the artist meticulously deploys a palette of potent colors that range from muted grays and blues to intense reds, bright greens, yellows, and deep purples. The result is an opaque architectural and chromatic pattern, made up of astonishingly subtle tonal shifts as well as of hard-edged color fields. Wilson's playful mixtures of colors, employing literally dozens of nuances demonstrate breathtaking risks, as the resulting variances in tone are always alive with stunning surprises.    In his practice of creating abstract paintings Patrick Wilson uses humble tools - he applies acrylic paint with a drywall knife to drag layers of translucent and dense coats of paint across the canvas to progressively build rectilinear spaces of line, pigment, light, and texture. Superimposing what seems like disarmingly easy geometric forms, on top of, beside, or inside each other, Wilson devises complex modular compositions which request careful observation, rewarding viewers who look closely.   Despite the obvious accuracy of Wilson’s method, the artist produces pieces by intuitive exploration of the relationships between color and shape. This playful attitude is the most obvious in the titled of Wilson’s paintings, which often connect his works to other, more quotidian, creative and sensual experiences such as cooking and dining.  In his series of works, The Chandler Paintings, the artist has named each piece after a different novel or short story of the American novelist and screenwriter Raymond Chandler, paying homage to the writer's depiction of the city of Los Angeles. All the paintings from that series of works were ranging in size from 17 inches square to over 7 feet high.  The artist describes himself as a “studio rat” and “painting junkie”, while he says that his new body of work is “organic”, because the paintings appear to be in a constant state of slow motion or growth. In one of his recent solo shows Steak Night held at Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects in 2014, Patrick presented his latest paintings composed of solid geometries, destabilized as they undulate with a vibrancy that contradicts their architectural references.  Patrick Wilson’s work has been exhibited throughout the United States, in many prestigious institutions and galleries, including Ameringer McEnery Yohe, New York, Marx & Zavattero, San Francisco, Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, Culver City, San Jose Museum of Art, San Jose, and Rebecca Ibel Gallery, Columbus, among others. Wilson’s work is included in many prestigious public and private collections including the Columbus Museum of Art, Columbus, Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, and the San Jose Museum of Art, San Jose, CA, to name a few.  Patrick Wilson currently lives and works in Los Angeles, CA.",558

stikman,"stikman, sometimes referred to as Stickman or Bob, is an anonymous American graffiti artist, the mastermind behind stikman - a robot-like figure which looks as if it is made of sticks. Not much is known about this mysterious author, except that his paste-ups have been popping up all over the US for more than 20 years. Somewhere around 1990, he went to a flea market in Philadelphia, where he found a plaque made of plaster which depicted a man made of sticks. The stick-man appeared to have broken the boundaries of the plaque, which intrigued the author so much, that he decided to share it with the rest of the world. In 1992, the first stikman appeared on the streets of New York, and the person behind it adopted the name stikman as his pseudonym. That same year, the author designed 50 more figures. Around 1996, he started developing and painting three-dimensional images of stikman.  The identity of the person is not clear. Neither age nor gender is known. That is why some believe that stikman could actually be a group of artists gathered around the concept of these little robot-like figures. In a 2008 Washington Post interview, a journalist interviewed stikman, who introduced himself as “Bob”. When he (or she? or they?) was little, the author saw a photograph in a magazine – a piece of one of Christo’s early works, where he piled up a bunch of rusty oil barrels against a wall. This photo struck stikman, and he decided that he wanted to make art. He often cites Christo as his inspiration and one of the first role models in the art world. Many viewers compare stikman’s works to Toynbee tiles, messages on asphalt by an unknown person which have sprung up in over 20 cities in the USA since the 80's. However, although he respects the author of the tiles, he says the two share very little, apart from their work environment and ‘paved canvas’.   Stikman has appeared in every major city in the USA and is made from many different materials, like wood, plastic, metal or cloth. Stikman’s choice of the surface also plays a part – it can most often be found on the pavement, or crosswalks (literal street art), hiding in plain sight. Some of the artist’s favorite surfaces include the walls of dilapidated buildings covered in stencils and paste-ups or other street elements altered by time. The first stikman appeared in the East Village, and it soon spread. Stikman says that there isn’t any particular meaning his little robot-people try to convey. Yet they can be analyzed by pedestrians if they feel the need to attach a certain meaning to them, mostly in terms of the environment that is occupied. However, stikman encourages the viewers to be more observant of their surroundings. And perhaps they are, as many people have noticed these signatures around cities streets. Some even “hunt” for them, comparing stikmen to Waldo, a character from a popular children’s game “Where’s Waldo?” (also known as “Where’s Wally?”).   The appeal of stikman’s artwork hasn’t escaped the critics’ and collectors’ notice. His brilliant work was a part of numerous group shows, and he’s also had several successful solo exhibitions as well. Stikman has cooperated with numerous galleries, like Stupid Easy and Pandemic, but also with Woodward Gallery in New York which represents him. One of the most notable group exhibitions he participated in, titled Sur-real, was organized in 2014.  ",561

Bruce Conner,"In his paintings, prints, photographs, films, sculptures, collages, and performances, American artist Bruce Conner examines the fears and desires of post-war American culture. From the rise of consumerism to the fear of nuclear apocalypse, the artist tackled themes that reside in people's subconsciousness. His fascination with mortality and grotesque is ever present in work inspired by Victorian-era aesthetics and Surrealist artworks. Today Conner's art is part of several public collections, including the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C, the Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Musee Modern in Stockholm, Museum Moderner Kunst in Vienna, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.   Bruce Conner (born in 1933 in McPherson, a city in Kansas) graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Nebraska and went on to study at the University of Colorado and the Brooklyn Museum Art School. In his early works, the artist was inspired by such movements as Dada and Abstract Expressionism. In 1956 Conner had his first solo exhibition in New York. The artist first gained public attention with his assemblages created out of found objects combined to create complex amalgams. Using items such as bicycle wheels, costumes, jewelry, fur, and broken dolls, the artist created complex compositions which were often erotically charged. In 1959 he made one of his most renowned pieces entitled Child, featuring an emaciated figure rotting in a chair. The work was inspired by and a homage to the executed prisoner Caryl Chessman whose life story left a profound impact on the artist. About his work, Conner said:   Over the course of several decades, Bruce Conner made numerous films and was considered a pioneer of avant-garde filmmaking. In 1958 he made his most famous piece, A Movie. Even though it is a 12-minute non-narrative film made out of short scenes from old newsreels and movies, it made quite an impact on the public and critics as well. Over time, the artist created his unique technique of quick-cut editing, which meant he could convey a lot in a single short movie. To create music for his films, Conner often collaborated with musicians. On the Crossroads (1976), he famously worked with Terry Riley and Patrick Gleeson. The 30-minute movie, which is today held at the Academy Film Archive, is credited for inspiring generations of young filmmakers.   Conner, who was a member of the San Francisco Beat movement, has had retrospective exhibitions at the Museo Reina Sofía, the Walker Art Center, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In 2016, a major retrospective of his work entitled It's All True was held at The Museum of Modern Art in New York. Bruce Conner passed away in 2008 in San Francisco. ",563
Carole Feuerman,"Carole Feuerman is an American sculptor whose breathtaking life-like sculptures won her a prestigious place of a pioneering figure in the world of hyperrealist sculpture. This style emerged in the 70s along with the photorealist painting. Together with her fellow artists Duane Hanson and John De Andrea, Feuerman was one of the three chief artists in making works that portray their models very precisely. In addition to their astounding, hard to believe precision, Feuerman’s pieces possess a subtle natural beauty, grace, elegance and an undeniable feel of inner peace.  When it comes to Feuerman’s artistic processes and materials, she works with bronze, marble, and resin. She transforms these materials, so they change their state from solid to liquid and vice versa. The look of each specific sculpture depends on Feuerman’s understanding of various materials and their properties. She is inspired by the basic elements, air, water, fire, and earth, so she casts bronze spheres of the earth, bronze figures of the Greek god of fire, or human figures floating on air or water. Feuerman’s sculptural tradition is rooted in the second Century bronze and marble busts of Roman eminent personalities. She does a lot of sketches and life drawing prior to sculpting, but once she gets down to work, she uses direct casting instead of three-dimensional models. She renders the details of her models, such as teeth, nails, pores, and wrinkles extremely meticulously, to give the viewer the impression of a real human being. In addition to her main pieces in bronze and marble, she also creates resin works which express various aspects of her own life but also the human condition in general. Even though she’s a well-recognized sculptor, Feuerman experiments with new media as well, combining her sculptural works with videos and projections.   The most frequent topic of Feuerman’s pieces is water and the way us humans experience water. Her swimmers seem serene, enjoying the experience of floating or holding onto a giant ball. Her other major creations represent the female figures engaged in various sports, such as gymnastic, running or yoga. All of them display a strong impression of well-being, health, and calming self-awareness. At the same time, each of her sculpture explores realism, sexuality, and reality.The majority of her works are portraying women of all races and skin colors as strong and active, which is emphasizing the idea of the global emancipation of women.   Feuerman’s successful career lasts over four decades and her work has been featured in five major museum retrospectives. Her amazing artworks have been exhibited worldwide - In Italy, she participated in Venice Biennale four times, while In Asia, she has shown her pieces in Harbour City in Hong Kong, The National Museum of China in Shanghai and the Daejeon Museum and Suwon Museums in Korea. Outside of galleries and museums, her sculptures have appeared in many outdoor venues, such as Petrosino Square in New York City and the Frederik Meijer Sculpture Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan. One of her most famous pieces, called The Golden Mean is placed in Riverfront Green Park near the Hudson River in NY. In 2011, Feuerman has founded the Carole A. Feuerman Sculpture Foundation in order to promote the global interest and passion for the arts and to inspire her fellow artists. Her pieces can be also found in many private international collections of eminent people such as the Emperor of Japan, President Hillary Clinton, Norman Brahman, Andrey Molchanov and Malcolm Forbes.   Feuerman’s amazing life-like pieces have been widely appreciated not only because of their technical perfection but also because of the questions of introspection, female well-being and universality they address. According to the artist herself, her work has been created to embody serenity, tranquility, purity, and passion for life and healthy lifestyle. Her projects are also dedicated to the basic elements, such as water, earth, fire, and air, which are, in a way, a celebration of the life itself and the beauty of our mother planet.

Hamish Fulton,"A self-characterized ""walking artist"", Hamish Fulton creates work based on the experience of walks, translating them into a variety of media, including photography, illustrations, and wall texts. Interested in Native American cultures and Buddhist meditation practices, Fulton has walked in more than 25 countries in the past 30 years, including trips to the tops of Mount Everest and Denali. Fulton is born in 1946 in London, where he still lives and works. He first attended the art foundation course at Hammersmith College of Art. With help from a tutor, David Hall, he was accepted straight into the advanced course at Saint Martin's School of Art, London, and the following year studied at the Royal College of Art, London. During visits to South Dakota and Montana in the 1960s, he decided that art should be about life, not about producing objects.

They represent the pure experience of raw nature. She feels her work is also an exploration of her true self in a way because it is connected to moments of solitude. “Simplicity and chaos, inner and outer world, stillness and motion are constant pillars of exploration in my working process.” Primarily interested in finding good forms and lines in relation to colors and haptic texture, Vogel seeks the mark-making tactility, breath, dynamics, and color. She usually paints without sketches, with an idea which colors she’ll be using. The first phase of the painting process is the fastest one, getting slower and slower over time. Vogel will even return to rework a piece after it’s been hanging in her studio for a few weeks. Understanding that as a painter, one must often act courageous, she experiments with materials and techniques, finding it to be quite stimulating for her working practice.

Rick Lewis,"Rick Lewis is an American artist who works primarily as an abstract painter, also incorporating drawing, printmaking, photography, and sculpture into his studio practice. He believes that his direct connection with the ecology of the Gulf Coast was pivotal to the early formulation of his aesthetic. Each work is “born out of relationships to or qualities within nature that connect with my psyche.” The natural environment is the only source that provides metaphors for his abstract paintings. Lewis' pieces have been exhibited in New York, Texas, Philadelphia, Hong Kong, and Indonesia and are held in various public and private collections throughout the world. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.   ",613

Ross Tamlin,"Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Ross Tamlin is a contemporary artist widely known and recognized for his corrugated iron paintings. These works, influenced by the De Stijl movement, represent a synthesis of art and function. Incorporating the aesthetics of modern industrial technique, the corrugation in the paintings is a visual illusion created by layers of paint and varnish. The use of bold modern signage adds another layer of visual interpretation. Tamlin completed 2 years of a Town Planning course and was offered a cadetship in a County Council. Knowing he wanted to be an artist, he declined the offer, emigrating to Australia in 1982. There he began his artistic education with a Fine Arts Certificate course at Meadowbank TAFE before completing a graphic arts course in Brisbane. After he returned to Sydney, he joined the artists’ studios in Rozelle, first at CASA studio and then 1+2 studio.   ",615

Julie Breton,"French Canadian artist Julie Breton creates colorful, gestural, abstract paintings that embody the dynamism and unpredictability of nature.  In a balancing act between improvisation and will, Breton merges calligraphic scribbles and spontaneous brush marks with thoughtfully placed collaged elements and carefully drawn forms.  Visually balanced yet playful, the work feels as though it has sprung from a place of boldness and unrestrained expression, and alludes to feelings of positivity and constructive energy. Abstract Expressionist influences are evident both in her expressive mark making and in her masterful use of extremes of dark and light hues to create a sense of movement and “Push Pull.”          Julie Breton is a recipient of the Visual Artist grant from the Arts Council for Canada, and is a member of the Visual Artists of British-Columbia Collective. She lives and works in Nelson, BC, Canada. Featured image: Julie Breton - portait. Photo courtesy IdeelArt",617

Leon Phillips,"Leon Phillips is a Canadian artist who explores the materiality of color. He sets up color-gesture situations that allow the physical nature of his tools and materials to express themselves. In his work, color is a structural element rather than a decorative one. Phillips studied at the University of Saskatchewan, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts cum laude (Fine Arts Major) in 1985; in 1989, he completed his Bachelor of Environmental Studies (Architecture) from the University of Waterloo.

Camila Quintero,"Camila Quintero's artworks are colorful space explorations. Through shapes, colors, and minimal lines, the visual artist investigates the relationship between the elements and their surroundings.  Currently based in London, Quintero holds a MA in Visual Arts from UAL / Camberwell College of Arts and a BA in Graphic Design.  Her artistic practice challenges the viewer's perception, creating three-dimensional compositions, with imperfect perspectives, distortions, and deconstructions. The result is an aesthetically abstract and geometric style that provokes a surreal sense of estrangement. Quintero works on colors and composition, drawing on both the great masters of Abstract Art and the functional shapes of Bauhaus, weaving a fruitful dialogue between art, design, photography, and architecture. Her acrylic on canvas paintings and digital prints on paper or Dibond show her interdisciplinary approach. Camila Quintero exhibited in several group exhibitions in galleries and auctions in London and showcased her selected work in Selfridges. Her paintings search for formal balances and spatial discovery.           Featured image: Camila Quintero - portrait. Photo courtesy of IdeelArt",623
Ed Ruscha,"Ed Ruscha is an American visual artist strongly associated with the Pop Art movement. He is proficient in many media, including photography, drawing, painting, and the creation of numerous artist books. Generally speaking, his art documents the shifting symbols of American life in the last half century. His deadpan representations of Hollywood logos and icons, gas stations, and landscapes convert the imagery of popular culture into a profound language of cinematic and typographical codes. Ruscha is also famous for his witty and wry choice of words and phrases used in his word paintings.   Ed Ruscha was born 1937 in Omaha, Nebraska and he studied painting, photography, and graphic design at the California Institute of the Arts. He comes from a Roman Catholic family and it is known that Ruscha’s mother was supporting his son’s artistic talents and interests. As a young boy, Edward Ruscha was quite interested in cartoons and comics and this interest has persisted a throughout his adolescence. Just like in the case of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, Ed Ruscha’s artistic skills were based on commercial art. In addition to his interest in cartoons, Ruscha was also passionate about graphic design and typography, which is evident in his works featuring various words and phrases carefully coordinated with the imagery and colors in the background. Ever since 1964, Ruscha has been exploring weird comic and satirical sayings related to the popular culture and life in LA.   In the 1970s, Ruscha started experimenting with many non-traditional organic materials and even truly weird things, such as vinyl, blood, red wine, fruits and vegetables, chocolate syrup, tomato paste, coffee, caviar, various plants, eggs and grass stains. Using these unusual materials, he made his famous screenprints called News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues in the 70s. The names of these pieces allude to the segments of British culture – for example, News represents the tabloid-minded country, while Stews is related to the typical British dish. In the 70s, he also used to produce word paintings with edible products applied on silk and moire. For instance, his piece named A Blvd. Called Sunset from 1975 was made by applying blackberry juice on moiré. It is interesting to note that most of Ruscha’s saturated organic colors would become muted gray, beige or brown after drying up. This can be noticed in his series Insects from 1972, which includes six screen prints consists of six screen prints of interesting insect species. During the same year, in April 1972, Ruscha’s edible art has got a lot of public exposure after his photograph spelling the name of the magazine using pieces of food became the cover of ARTNews. His piece called Fruit Metrecal Hollywood is another great example the artist's application of weird materials. In this particular case, he used apricot and grape jam to paint on paper. When it comes to the topics of Ruscha’s works from the mid-1960s and 70s, their goal is to merge the representative and absurd approaches, creating a surreal atmosphere. His works from this era often show bouncing and floating objects, as well as the distortion of size and proportions. Ruscha’s style from this era is strongly resembling surrealism, which has an important place in the artist’s career. A common recurring motif in Ruscha's work is a depiction of a pencil, which is broken, melted, transformed, somewhat like the objects in famous paintings of Salvador Dali.   During his years in Los Angeles, Ruscha became quite obsessed with Hollywood and everything it represented. He even said that Hollywood is a verb. It played a very important role in his art and it was his favorite muse. In 1973, he even photographed the entire Hollywood Boulevard. His love for Hollywood grew even stronger after he started getting engaged in the movie industry – for example, his painting The End from 1991 looks exactly like the final shot in the old black and white movies. Also, the proportions of his prints from the Hollywood series were made to mimic the Cinemascope screen. In order to create the word Hollywood in his pieces, Ruscha had to transpose the letters from their usual location in Santa Monica Mountains to the top the hill.   Ruscha's word paintings represent the result of his long-term interest in words and typography. The very first of Ruscha's word paintings oil paintings on paper, created in Paris in 1961. Later on, from 1966 to 1969, Ruscha started using a new style, called liquid word paintings. His pieces such as Adios from 1967 and Desire from 1969 were written as if using a spilled liquid over a simple flat surface. He also used gunpowder and graphite drawings from 1967 to 1970. His artworks from this short interval feature words represented in a trompe l’oeil technique, which means they look like as if they were made of curling paper. In the 1970s, Ruscha became one of the pioneers of inserting phrases into visual arts, together with Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer. Later on, this particular style became of the main directions in the post-Pop Art generation. In the mid-1970s, Ruscha made an innovative series of drawings in pastel using witty phrases, while in the early 1980s he made a splendid series of paintings of words written over sunsets or late night skies. In the 90s, Ruscha has changed his style again and started producing photorealist images of mountains. He also changed his approach to typography and began to use the all-caps typeface that he invented and named Boy Scout Utility Modern. This simple font is very different from the ones he used to use in his old works. Also, it is interesting to note that in the mid-80s, Ruscha was using black or white censor strips in his works, in order to suggest where the missing words should have been positioned. The similar blank space is also used in his Silhouette and Cityscapes series.   Photography was a really important medium during the entire Ruscha’s career. He started taking pictures back in 1961 when he traveled to Europe with his family. His photo imagery is quite simple and straightforward, even deadpan at times and his subjects often lack some basic aesthetic values. His series called Products represents boxes of raisins and various kitchen cleaning items, such as detergents. Ruscha’s photos rarely portray humans, they revolve around formal still lifes and simple environments. His photo editions are also rooted in the conceptual approach, which becomes evident especially in his art books. One of his most famous photographic books is called Every Building on Sunset Strip and it is based on the negatives of six images from his book, which we reworked in a certain way. The artist was painted on the negatives, which resulted in photographs which look like faded black-and-white film. His another photo series called Tropical Fish, from 1974, is somewhat different since in this case the artist has used the unaltered photographs directly in his work. During the 1970s, in addition to his photographic pieces, Ruscha has also dedicated himself to filmmaking and he made a number of short films, such as Premium from 1971 and Miracle from 1975. Premium was filmed thanks to the help of Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship. Ruscha based the scenario of this short movie on his photo book from 1969 and transformed it into a film which features Larry Bell and Leon Bing. When it comes to Miracle, it is also based on one of the artist’s previous pieces, a painting of the same name, describing an unusual day in the life of an auto mechanic. The main actors in this movie are Jim Ganzer and Michelle Phillips. In 1984, he even appeared in a movie himself. In Choose Me, directed by Alan Rudolph, he accepted a small role. More recently, in 2010, Ruscha appeared in another movie, called Sleepwalkers. Besides regular movies, Ruscha’s presence is notable in a couple of documentaries. He was featured in Michael Blackwood's American Art in the Sixties and also L.A. Suggested by the Art of Edward Ruscha, which is 1981 documentary made by Gary Conklin. A lot of interviews with Ruscha are included in the following documentaries:  The Decisive Moments from 2002, The Cool School and Iconoclasts from 2008 and How to Make a Book with Steidl, from 2010.   Ed Ruscha has a very long history of exhibitions since he’s an active exhibitor starting from the 60s. One of the first important public commissions he made is a monumental mural at the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego in 1966 and a large 360-degree panel made for the Public Library in Denver. Later on, in 1998, Ruscha made another giant public project, which was a thirty-foot high painting called Picture Without Words, for the Harold M. Williams Auditorium. In 2014, he made his first public commission in New York City, called Honey, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today, which is again a large mural. Ruscha has also participated in the celebration of the 75th anniversary of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, by creating a limited-edition of T-shirts. Ruscha has also numerous private commissioned works, such as Public Stoning from 2007, Boy Meets Girl from 1987 and Stella from 2001. In 1970, Ruscha took part in the Venice Biennale and he had his own printmaking workshop these. He designed the Chocolate Room, an innovative visual and sensory 360-degree experience, where the visitors were completely engulfed by the seductive world of chocolate. Because of this, the entire pavilion in Venice smelled like a chocolate. Ruscha has been the subject of numerous museum retrospectives, the first one being held in 1983 at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles organized another important retrospective of his work in 1998 and the Whitney Museum of American Art has done the same in 2004. In 2006, even European museums started organizing retrospectives of Ruscha’s splendid work, such as the Jeu de Paume in Paris, the Kunsthaus Zurich, and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.   J. Paul Getty Museum and the Getty Research Institute have acquired many of Ruscha’s photographs and also his Streets of Los Angeles archive. This archive consists of many negatives, photo contact sheets, and similar documents. Some of these items will become the artist’s gift to Getty. Another institution interested in Ruscha’s work is Harry Ransom Center. In 2013, this center acquired the artist’s archive which consists of numberless journals, sketches, and notes, as well as the materials for the artist's book called On The Road. Harry Ranson Center also acquired his materials related to the short films Miracle and Premium as well as his legendary portfolios. A large portion of these works is donated to the archive of the Ransom Center by the artist.   I could see I was just born for the job, born to watch paint dry, Ruscha says about his natural predilection for visual arts. Even though his images are based in the vernacular of a closely observed American society, they are elegant in a laconic way. They don’t speak only about the American lifestyle and culture, but also about more complex, universal and widespread issues related to the appearance, meaning and function of the world we’re living in, which is a transient, ever-changing place, and each of its different phases has a certain artistic charm to it. The artist is represented by Gagosian Park & 75 New York, Gagosian Madison Avenue New York, Gagosian West 24th Street, Gagosian Beverly Hills, Gagosian Britannia Street,  Gagosian West 21st Street, and Galerie Fluegel-Roncak.

John Baldessari,"Certainly one of the most notorious names that can be found in contemporary art is John Baldessari He was an American artist and teacher who fused photography, montage, painting and text to create complex compositions that explore the multifaceted interpretations of cultural iconography, all the while keeping his signature sense of humor. This artist began his career the mid-1950s and not for a second along the way did he lose his creative touch that made him famous in the first place - although he might have denied it down to the fact he burnt all his early works, turning them into dust that he then kept as a souvenir. For decades, Baldessari was considered to be a leading Californian Conceptual artist.   John Baldessari was born during the year of 1931, in National City, California. He attended The San Diego State University and did post-graduate work at Otis Art Institute, Chouinard Art Institute and the University of California at Berkeley. Such prestigious institutions provided Baldessari with a great command over creating and understanding all aspects of art. Since John always enjoyed speaking and educating others about art, it was only natural that he would get involved in teaching - he taught at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, CA from 1970 - 1988 and the University of California at Los Angeles from 1996 - 2007. Although an excellent professor, the highlight of Baldessari work is without a doubt his creative artistic side. Since the beginning of his career, Baldessari has been guided by one simple idea - if John saw the art around him that he liked, then he wouldn’t do art. He built the foundations of his profession by his pioneering use of appropriated imagery. Via blending photography, painting and text, Baldessari’s work examined the plastic nature of artistic media while offering commentary on our contemporary culture. John explained his drives by stating: I’ve often thought of myself as a frustrated writer. I consider a word and an image of equal weight, and a lot of my work comes out of that kind of thinking. Its always hard to precisely pin down and explain Baldessari's art, as he has been tirelessly trying to keep his portfolio as versatile as possible, including photomontage, artist’s books, prints, paintings, film, performance and installation. The medium of painting was important to his early work - when he emerged, in the early 1960s, he was working in a gestural style. But by the end of the decade he had begun to introduce text and pre-existing images, often doing so to create riddles that highlighted some of the unspoken assumptions of contemporary art. Of course, we repeat that John actually burned all of his early works, so it's not a challenge to figure out which half of his career Baldessari actually prefers.   Baldessari was undoubtedly one of the leading figures Conceptual art has seen in the last half of a century - John focused on the perception and interpretation of visual elements and text, while often employing irony to make playful assertions about how meanings are formed. And we use the playful term quite appropriately, we assure you - Baldessari was one of the most fun artists of his generation, as well as many younger ones. He was known to state such sentences as I will not make any more boring art and I think it’s brilliant: making art look like it’s not about skill - these and many more serve as a bulletproof evidence and testimony of John's already legendary sense of humour. Over the course of his career, John Baldessari derived imagery from a wide range of sources, mostly advertising and film. He established a way of subverting common visual associations by drawing attention to minute details, absurd juxtapositions and obscured or fragmented portions of images. Over the years, Baldessari applied various painterly elements to make sure viewers do not oversee that the hand of the artist is not only present in the placement of the images but is also there in the hybridization of the creative process. Baldessari’s work has been exhibited worldwide with more than 200 solo and in over 1000 group shows, with the most notable locations being the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, The Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum in New York and the Documentas 4, 5, and 6 in Kassel. During the year of 2009, a monumental retrospective of his work titled John Baldessari: Pure Beauty opened at the Tate Modern in London before traveling to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona in Spain. This show was a great success and it did not fail to attract mass attention wherever the work was displayed.     Baldessari's projects include artist books, videos, films, billboards and public works. His two-dimensional works often incorporate found images, composed in layers or presented as distinct pieces with an element of surprise, like a brightly colored geometric shape in the place of a face or a starkly printed sardonic caption. One of the most iconic signatures John used in his career is his characteristic use of colorful dots atop photographic images. This created some of the most instantly recognizable series ever created. John was often associated with Minimalist or Conceptual art, though he called this characterization a little bit boring. He always preferred to be associated with the name of Marcel Duchamp, although many critics have connected him with the works of Andy Warhol. Baldessari's awards and honors include the 2014 National Medal of Arts Award, an upcoming award from the International Print Center New York in 2016, memberships in the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Americans for the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award, the Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, the BACA International 2008, the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement, awarded by La Biennale di Venezia and the City of Goslar Kaiserring in 2012. He has received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland, San Diego State University, Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, and California College of the Arts. Such recognitions only cemented Baldessari's name as one of the most leading artists to emerge from the second half of the 20th century.  As you could have already concluded on your own so far, John Baldessari is considered by many to be one of the most important proponents of West Coast Art. As if his artwork was not enough to permanently glue him onto the pages of art history, Baldessari also championed emerging artists that came out of California Art Schools, further extending his legacy by influencing many younger people through his extensive teaching career. Through a diverse practice that includes paintings, sculpture and installations, John fastened his position as one of the greatest conceptual artists out there, not to speak about probably the most entertaining one in the history of art. The artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art in Miami, Weng Contemporary in London, kunzt.gallery and Mai 36 Gallery in Zurich. He died in 2020 at the age of 88.

Julian Opie,"The work of influential British artist Julian Opie has been consistent for several decades largely due to establishing the recognizable style. Minimal and linear, those compositions usually represent everyday sights – humans or animals in movement or their portraits, billboard or pub signs, buildings, etc. By examining his personal experience, Opie is dealing not only with the transience of the moment or its meaning, more importantly, the artist is critically dissecting socially moderated patterns of behavior and thinking. In addition to that, an oeuvre of his represents a fine example of art practice which tries still to stay visually daring by encompassing contemporary moment with popular culture and traditional art.  Julian Opie was born in London in 1958 and raised in Oxford. He graduated in 1983 from Goldsmiths, University of London, where he was taught by conceptual artist and painter Michael Craig-Martin. After the end of studies, he started exhibiting with artists like Tony Cragg, Richard Deacon and Anish Kapoor. Mainly they, as well as a couple of other artists, were gathered around the Lisson Gallery, and their work became known as New British Sculpture. A synthesis of pop and kitsch, focus on producing bricolages out of objects from an urban environment and waste, humor and wit were some of the main subjects prevailing in their works.   In his early works, Opie was focused on steel sculptures, almost architectural structures, and abstract, geometrical shapes. Obviously influenced, on one side, by the Minimal and on the other by Pop art, he started to shape his distinct aesthetics by purifying the compositions, cleaning them from any sufficient detail and realizing them through installations, prints, and sculpture in the extended field. That is how Opie developed simple linear comic book look like forms and reduced colored areas, which then became his signifier. Fixation with portraits remained present until nowadays, as well as before mentioned references to art history, only the technological process has changed. Through the years the artist has become active with other media, especially in graphic art and digital art, respectively LED projections and animations.[1]   Public art of Julian Opie is spread around the globe, from continuous animations on LCD screens such as Suzanne Walking (2002) in Dublin or Galloping Horse (2012) in Yorkshire Park, or installation Public collections, including the Tate Gallery in London, the National Museum of Art in Osaka, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York poses Opie’s works from different periods.Besides the institutional frame, he has been collaborating with the famous pop band Blur, creating the cover for their Best of the album, and with a rock star Bryan Adams. Nevertheless, Opie’s art does not suffer from agenda of obtaining successful career by pure mechanical production, yet the works he produces are full of wit, humor and innovation.  References:  ",626
John Chamberlain,"John Chamberlain, born in 1927, is considered one of the most important American Post-War sculptors, known for his intuitive compilations of interlocking metals and use of industrial media. The artist grew up in Chicago, IL, before serving in the United States navy from 1943 to 1946. After serving, he attended the Art Institute of Chicago between 1951 and 1952, where he began making welded sculptures, drawing influence from sculptor David Smith. Following his stay in Chicago, he enrolled in Black Mountain College in 1955, where he studied and taught for two years. Chamberlain moved to New York immediately afterward. At that time, he began including car parts into his work, crushing and welding pieces together to create abstract clusters. Chamberlain’s first solo exhibition was held in 1960 at the Martha Jackson Gallery. The exposure led to his work being included in The Museum of Modern Art's 1961 group exhibition, Art of Assemblage, a survey of artists working with two and three-dimensional constructions, offering a new and forceful articulation of the ideas of Abstract Expressionism. While the artist was widely known for his use of automobile parts, metals, and Plexiglas in large-scale sculptures, he also experimented with other media, making geometric paintings scattered with automobile paint. His first retrospective was held in 1971 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, NY. He received many honors, including a Lifetime Achievement Award in Contemporary Sculpture from the International Sculpture Center in Washington, D.C., in 1993, and a Distinction in Sculpture Honor from the Sculpture Center in New York in 1999. Continuing his exploration of new media, Chamberlain undertook photography in the last decade of his life, creating large-format images that reflected the use of color in his sculptures. This final endeavor portrayed the sensitivity with which the artist approached his works, allowing their presence to express meaning rather than seeking to overcomplicate or trivialize the materials. The artist died in New York in 2011.",627
Roxy Paine,"An internationally acclaimed American artist, Roxy Paine is best known for his sculptures comprised of shining pipes, plates and rods that have been cut, bent and welded into branchlike structures. Born in 1966 New York, Paine was raised in the suburbs of northern Virginia. He described this suburban experience as a ""twisted vision of nature"" within an environment that possessed an ""overwhelming blandness"".  it was in California, where he moved to live with his brother, a hiker and rock climber, that he decided to become an artist. He was educated at both the College of Santa Fe (now Santa Fe University of Art and Design) in New Mexico and the Pratt Institute in New York. He exhibited his work in venues such as Paul Kasmin Gallery, New York, NY, Gund Gallery, Columbus, Ohio, Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids, MI, Marianne Boesky, New York, NY, Kavi Gupta, Chicago, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, MO and James Cohan Gallery, New York, among others. Since 1990, Paine began showing his work in Williamsburg, Brooklyn where he cofounded the artist collective Brand Name Damages. His early works focused on the collision of conflicting impulses of information such as industry and nature, control and chaos, form and theory. Over the years, he began melding the industrial and the organic to explore manmade and natural systems, using machines, fields, fungus and weeds, specimen cases, dendroids and dioramas. He divided his work in several categories - Art Making Machines, Replicants, Fungal Fields, Specimen Cases and Dendroids. ",628
Franz Ackermann,"A German multimedia artist, Franz Ackermann is recognized for his monumental paintings, large-scale installations and numerous public commissions, in which he touches on the thematics of globalization, tourism and travel. His psychedelic works often portray interiors and architecture in a distinct disjointed, cartoony aesthetic. Born in 1963 in the Bavarian Neumarkt-Sankt Veit, Ackermann currently lives and works in Berlin. He graduated from the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste in Munich and the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg. He has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including the 2003 Venice Biennale, and at venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Tate Liverpool, Pace le aloghy de Tokyo in Paris and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. His works are held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, among others. Ackermann creates works of saturated colors, featuring overlapping forms that merge with fragments of images taken directly from urban reality. These works expose hints of identifiable place, such as a street map, a building interior, a snippet of landscape, which are dislocated in a maze of organic generalizations. He is best known for his series Mental Maps, where he documented his perception of the great cities of Asia, South America and Australia.",629

Inka Essenhigh,"American painter Inka Essenhigh creates dreamlike imagery of surreal biomorphic shapes. The oil and enamel paintings, often made through automatic drawing, draw on an astute awareness of her immediate environment. Inspired by Surrealism, animation, and graphic novels, the artist always attempts to make something pleasurable. Her paintings feature everyday scenes such as drinking in a bar or a walk in the park and possess humorous qualities and waves of energy that make canvas alive. Today Essenhigh's artworks are part of numerous public collections, including Tate Gallery in London, Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY, Seattle Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami, Denver Art Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Museum of Modern Art in New York.   Inka Essenhigh was born in 1969 in Pennsylvania. She graduated from Columbus College of Art & Design in Ohio with a BFA and later received an MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York. The artist's first received recognition after two solo shows in New York, at the Stefan Stux Gallery (1998) and Deitch Projects (1999). Because of free association and autonomic drawings, Essenhigh's early work is often compared to Pop Surrealism for its dreamlike quality.  Later in her career, the artist abandoned the freestyle, citing that she does not have to put everything on her mind on canvas. The colorful palleted, form and high-gloss surfaces turn her paintings into almost three-dimensional sculptures. Together with Lisa Yuskavage, Will Cotton, and John Currin, Essenhigh belongs to the first generation of American painters to return to figuration.   Essenhigh's enjoyed painting with enamel in the mid-1990s, creating biomorphic shapes and flat planes of color. However, in 2001 in search of more depth in her work, she began using oil. Thus when comparing her early work, such as Holly Hobby (1997), to later Arrows of Fear (2002), there is a distinct change in style and technique. Instead of a flat surface, she began infusing her paintings with dynamism and flow that was only possible through the use of oils. Once again, in 2021, Essenhigh returns to enamel paint in a series of botanical works in a solo exhibition at Victoria Miro in Venice. Her paintings, which were once closely associated with Surrealism, now possess finely drawn narratives making them in style closer to Symbolism.   Some of Inka Essenhigh's latest solo exhibitions are A Fine Line (2018) at the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts in Michigan and Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art; Other Worlds: Inka Essenhigh (2019) at the Susquehanna Art Museum; Uchronia (2019) at Kavi Gupta Gallery in Chicago an Inka Essenhigh (2020) at the New York's Miles McEnery Gallery. The artist also participated in numerous group shows, including Le Nuove Frontiere della Pittura (2018) at Fondazione Stelline in Milan, and in 2020 the exhibition titled Really. at the Miles Energy Gallery in New York. Essenhigh has received the CCAD Alumni Award for Excellence from Columbus, OH, and the Arts and Letters Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York, NY. Inka Essenhigh lives and works in New York. ",632
Tenesh Webber,"Tenesh Webber is a Canadian contemporary artist known for her black-and-white abstract photography. During the past twenty-five years she has explored large-scale imagery, negative layering and solarization with a medium-format camera. In her practice, Webber quests the intersection of such media as photography, drawing, and sculpture. Webber's recent series of work explore light, shadow and tone by using an all-over composition.    Although she uses both traditional and nontraditional photographic processes, the central point of her practice is making the photogram which represents a unique art form requiring only the action of light on a photosensitive substrate. To create an image without the aid of a camera she puts handmade objects, cut paper, thread, and aerosol-painted synthetic glass on a sheet of paper and exposes it to light. Each print is inimitable, with negligible variations that remind the viewer of marks more related with pen, pencil, and paper depicting rhythmic, intuitive compositions and creating a tension between the organic and rectilinear shapes.  Born in 1963 in Toronto, Canada, she received her BFA in Experimental Arts from Ontario College of Art in 1985. She has been a full-time visual arts teaching artist at Lincoln Center Education since 1992. She also taught in art centers and museums throughout the five boroughs of New York City. Her photographs were exhibited in many individual and collective shows at galleries throughout Canada, the United States and Europe including Yossi Milo Gallery, NY; Howard Yezerski Gallery, Boston; Storefront Ten Eyck Gallery, Brooklyn, NY; Gallerji Jan Colle, Ghent, Belgium; The Brooklyn Museum of Art, Brooklyn, NY; and Gallery 101, Houston, Texas, among others. Her work is included in many public and private collections, including The Brooklyn Museum of Art, The Asian American Art Center, Center for Visual Communications, Miami, Galeria Spectra, Zaragoza, Spain, and Barclay Bank.  She is represented by IdeelArt since October 2015.   All images courtesy of IdeelArt and the artist",633
Romain Langlois,"When a time for change finally comes, you should accept it. Even if you were satisfied with the past, who knows what the future carries, and sometimes that unpredictability is thrilling. Something similar happened to Romain Langlois, who worked with an architect for five years designing stores and other objects, before discovering his true calling – the sculpture. A self-taught artist, he started learning about the human body and faces, before moving forward to what surrounds us, even working with garbage. He is known for reworking the materials in a fashion that intrigues and makes the viewers question their perception of both what they see with their eyes and what they know.   Speaking about the process of working with bronze, it starts with expressive and anatomical modeling of the subject, then the modeling is refined and the expression is getting corrected. Creating an elastomer mold is the next step, just before making the mold rigid by adding the resin. The bronze pieces are melted in a specialized foundry. In the end, Langlois cleans the sculpture and adds patina, giving it the final appearance. The perenniality and the vibrational quality of the bronze, aside from the ability to lock and reveal placed emotions are the main reasons he uses it the most. As of 2013 and a collaboration with Eric Papon, Langlois’ long lasting fascination with the processes of crystallization and petrification had helped him introduce a new method of creating art. A mould is placed under a petrifying fountain for several months while the progressive crystallization of the calcium carbonate, controlled daily by the craftsman, gives rise to the work of art, drop by drop. This transmutation of substance, a process that nature requires thousands and thousands of years to accomplish, is happening right before the artist’s watchful eyes.   He was born in Saint-Etienne and worked for five years with an architect making stores in the late 90’s. In 1999, he overnight started making sculptures and learning about the human body by reading the anatomical charts and medical books. Langlois spent six months studying at the School of Decorative Arts in Strasbourg but failed to learn what he was interested in, and that were techniques. Since he didn’t learn them, he decided to teach himself. The interest in bronze came in 2002. Since 2011, the nature-inspired artworks appear in his oeuvre, where the most common of elements, like stones, branches, and trunks, become models. More recently, Langlois developed an interest in the industrial waste, a surroundings of human beings in its most immediate space. The artist takes these scraps that no one longer see, and transforms them like a true alchemist, giving them a new look and a new life. Everything is alive and moving, constantly changing. Sadly, life can’t always show its best side, and the artist attempts to root out that hidden beauty and to breath a new life into the matter.   Langlois works with materials that allow him to say a little bit more, constantly seeking more opportunities for expression rather than embracing the existing reality. That’s always been the idea behind his work. He admires this amazing feature seen in great sculptors, as they are always right, even when venturing far from reality. The artist subtly captures the attention of the audience, successfully avoiding the trap of pretentiousness, simplifying the idea to the maximum. Their attention is subconsciously being shifted towards greater questions, such as environment and even re-birth, successfully giving new life to things like discarded and rotting beans. He is represented by Artistics, an online gallery based in Paris.  ",634

Fabienne Verdier,"Fabienne Verdier is a French abstract artist and one of the very few European artists to have mastered traditional Chinese ink painting. Many of her paintings are the result of exercises in making continuous movements with a brush in different ways, during which she varies pressure, speed, and ink density. Born in 1962 in Paris, France, Verdier left for China in 1985 at the age of 22 to study at the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in Chongqing. At the same time, she began training with the last great Chinese painters who had survived the Cultural Revolution, whom she persuaded to transmit their mastery of spontaneous painting and aesthetic theories despite continued bans. She is the first non-Chinese woman to be awarded a post-graduate diploma in fine arts by the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in Chongqing, China. After that, she began to progressively create her own new abstract painting. In 2014, Verdier was the first visual artist-in-residence at the Juilliard School in New York, where she undertook live studio experiments seeking to answer the question of whether painting and music, in the moment of creation, might be “played” simultaneously. Combining Eastern knowledge and philosophy with Western expressionism, Verdier produces large abstract paintings, characterized by bold, gestural brushstrokes. She works in her unique method of vertical painting, using a handmade brush with a large reserve of paint, allowing her to express her seemingly unstoppable flow of energy. ",636
Susan Cantrick,"Matters of pre-verbal perception have concerned artists for a long time, but in the work of Susan Cantrick, this particular preoccupation is brought into focus. By passing representational or conceptual/relational modes of expression, Cantrick’s abstract paintings aim to articulate the complexities of emergent cognition.   Susan Cantrick was born in 1952.  After receiving her B.A. from Bennington College (Vermont, U.S.A.), she pursued an M.M. at the Peabody Conservatory of Music (Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.).  In 1997, due to chronic tendonitis, she ended a fifteen-year career as a violinist in both the U.S. and France (where she has lived since 1990), transitioning her creative practice from violin to visual art. Since then she has shown regularly in solo and group exhibitions in both France and the U.S.    For Cantrick, abstraction offers unique possibilities for the structured expression of visual thinking. As Françoise Caille has put it: … the work appears to be a constructive game of working out the best equilibrium among the forces at play. The artist deploys a gamut of modernist painterly techniques mediated by post-modern digital interventions, achieving a unique stylistic eclecticism in tune with contemporary artistic tendencies.  Cantrick’s process, whereby she works from digital studies derived from collaged photo-fragments of her previous work, reveals an interest in how shifts in context alter and renew identity.  While Cantrick regards painting as an essentially transitive phenomenon -- as much state of mind as process and object – she wants her paintings to be as clear as possible, providing the viewer a direct pathway toward recognition and response.   The starting point of Cantrick’s elaborate process is her conviction about painting as a form of perceptual inquiry rather than of narration, illustration, or critique.  Fascinated by the capacity of humans to think clearly without words, she seeks to create compelling two-dimensional analogs of the moment at which her perceptions begin to cohere but before they are formulated into the language.  For her, color is essential to animating and enriching these visual compositions, exciting complex sensorial responses in the viewer. She thinks of color as bringing life to painting.    Although Cantrick herself minimalizes it, her musical background undoubtedly influences her visual thinking.  Compositional structure, rhythmic repetition, chromatic contrasts, and the evocation of time that can be achieved with transparent layering are vital elements in her work that contribute to a fluid sense of the pictorial space. Susan Cantrick received the Art Absolument prize at the Parisian Salon des Réalités Nouvelles in 2013, and her work has been acquired by private collectors in France, Great Britain, the U.S., and Japan.

Gudrun Mertes-Frady,"Gudrun Mertes-Frady is a New York-based abstract artist whose work blends geometric structure with intuitive, painterly explorations of color and line. Mertes-Frady was born in Cologne, Germany. She studied painting and art history at the Cologne Academy of Fine and Applied Arts.   Mertes-Frady shifts her practice between painting and drawing. Her processes for the two are quite different. Her drawings manifest quickly and intuitively as she applies multiple layers of Conte crayon, graphite, charcoal and metallic crayon to hand-made sheets of Japanese paper, such as Kozo (made from mulberry trees) or Gampi (made from the gampi bush). Her work on mylar evolves over a longer period of time. Using a mixture of ink and water-based media, she creates layered, expressionistic, abstract compositions, often using both the front and back of the semi-translucent surface in order to add dimensionality and depth.  Her paintings are all oil on canvas, linen and sometimes wood panel. She frequently includes pigments of aluminum and graphite. This metallic media becomes activated by ambient light, creating a kinetic effect when the work is viewed from different angles. (All the white appearing lines in some of her paintings are actually metallic oil paint and change from soft grey to a luminous silver.)  Raised in a family of architects, Mertes-Frady learned early on to appreciate the visual language of the grid. Her background led her to appreciate the structure of paintings by Constructivist artists like Malevich and Bauhaus artists like Mondrian. Throughout her career she has experimented with many different mediums and techniques, but has always relied on the geometry of the grid for stability. Even her more lyrical, “all-over” drawings are underpinned by an architectonic arrangement of space.  Despite their structured appearance, however, Mertes-Frady never plans her compositions in advance. She is inspired by instinct and intuition. By freeing herself to react in the moment to arbitrary choices about color, texture, and line, unexpected and beautiful contrasts are allowed to develop between the architectonic structure of the work and its painterly spirit.  In an essay about the work of Mertes-Frady, acclaimed art journalist Lilly Wei writes,   Mertes-Frady has had more than 20 solo exhibitions in the U.S. and Europe. Her work is in many public, private, and corporate collections, including that of Rockefeller University, Universal Music, The Busch Reisinger Museum, Gwynneth Paltrow, the American Embassy in Dubai, and many others. She has lived and worked in New York City since 1981. ",639
Gerhard Richter,"The happiest of endings can have such sad beginnings. Growing up in Nazi Germany, witnessing the horrors of war, and being oppressed by the Communist regime in East Germany – the early life of Gerhard Richter was everything but happy and carefree. However, faced with tough choices, he made some bold decisions and overcame the difficulties, growing up to become one of the most significant artists in the contemporary world.  Gerhard Richter was born on February 9, 1932, and was the first child of Horst and Hildegard Richter, who also had a daughter, Gisela, born in 1936. Horst and his son never had a close relationship, while Hildegard was a bookseller, a talented pianist, and very passionate about literature - a true source of inspiration for Gerhard. In 1935, Horst was offered a teaching position at a school in Reichenau (which is now in Poland, but at the time was a part of Saxony), and the entire family moved to a town much smaller and far less stimulating than Dresden. However, as the WWII broke out, it turned out to be also a much safer place to live than the bigger city that took a massive bombardment. The strain between a father and his son was further increased as first was conscripted into the German army, sent to the eastern front, before ending up captured by the allies on the western front and spending the last days of the war as a POW. When he eventually returned home, he was disgraced, and Gerhard shared much of the fate that was pointed at his father. Even though the family relocated from Reichenau to the even smaller Waltersdorf during the war, and managed to escape the gruesome destruction of Dresden, their experience of war was nonetheless intense. The ending of the conflict coincided with Gerhard’s transition from childhood to adolescence, and the Germany he was born into seized to exist due to war and the following Soviet occupation. While difficult in many ways, Richter was able to find some joy in the years following the end of WWII. He (everyone else) gained access to books that were prohibited under Nazi regime, and his mother’s influence and love for literature really showed up, as she encouraged him to read Schiller, Goethe, Nietzsche, and many others. It was around this time, at 15, that Richter began to develop an interest for art, having an early epiphany during an eight-week summer camp organized by the Russian-controlled State, where he spent a lot of time drawing. He still remembers some of the pieces made at the time, like the watercolor drawing he produced whilst living in the village of Waltersdorf. Being unable to speak the dialect, he was jealous of all the dancing people, and out of anger and bitterness came one his first artworks. In 1947, parallel to his studies of stenography accounting and Russian at college in Zittau, Richter began attending evening classes in painting. One year later, he moved to Zittau, and on completing studies, still did not assume that he’d end up as a painter. His first job was to produce banners for the government of German Democratic Republic, but during his time there, he never actually painted any of the banners and was rather charged with cleaning the old ones and preparing them for his colleagues. In 1950, he became an assistant set painter for the municipal theater in Zittau. Young Richter enjoyed his time at the theater but was promptly dismissed when he refused to do wall painting work on the theater's staircases. Without a job, in 1951 he returned to his home city of Dresden, ready to begin his formal studies to be a painter.   Upon his return to Dresden, Richter found it to be a very different city than the one he was born and spent the first three years of his life in. Most of the city was destroyed, but some buildings, or parts of buildings, were still intact, reminding of the city’s past beauty. The artist considered admittance to the Academy a great deal and was very excited to study there. In addition to the rigorous daily routine of artistic classes, the students also learned about Soviet politics and economy. Soon after enrolling at the Academy, Richter met Marianne Eufinger, known as Ema, a fashion and textiles student, who, in 1957, became his (first) wife. As much as it seemed traditional and conservative, the Academy was more liberal in comparison to the agenda of the authorities in East Germany. However, that was about to change, and the artist couldn’t even borrow books on impressionism, as it was deemed decadent, and the studies of formalist art, with the exception of Picasso and Renato Guttuso, was not permitted. Despite all these obstacles and the growing pressure on personal liberties, Richter found his training in Dresden very influential. In 1956, having successfully completed his studies at the Academy, Richter was accepted into a program run by the Academy for talented and promising graduates, where he received a studio and a modest income for the next three years in exchange for teaching evening classes to the public. Things were looking promising, and yet he felt growing increasingly uncomfortable with the restrictions imposed on his work. There was no choice – get back into the line and compromise, or be punished. After seeing works by Lucio Fontana, Jean Fournier, and Jackson Pollock, Richter realized that his way of expression was different than theirs, and lacking in necessary freedom. So, in 1961, he carefully planned and executed his escape to West Germany with Ema. The new chapter in the artist’s career began out of necessity, but it was the right move. The only move, considering his artistic future. Munich was the original destination, but Richter settled in Düsseldorf, following advice from his friend Reinhard Graner, who already lived there. Despite having completed his studies in Dresden, the Staatliche Kunstakademie Düsseldorf was progressive, so Richter decided to apply. As a student, in addition to the latest trends and techniques he finally had an opportunity to study, he also received a stipend, which was a crucial source of income in those first years after defecting from East Germany. He started off in the class of Ferdinand Macketanz, painting intensely. Unhappy with most of these pieces, he destroyed most of them. It still was an important phase of his career, as he went through a lot of experimentation. After the first semester, he moved into the class of Karl Otto Götz, who was probably the most attractive professor at the Academy. There he met Konrad Fischer, Sigmar Polke, and Blinky Palermo, who all became friends and mutual influences. They were all very competitive, but also very supportive of one another, keen to improve their art and make a name for themselves, often exhibiting together. Along with keeping abreast of developments in Germany, they paid a close attention to overseas and the development of Pop Art, each enriching his own thinking and practice with different elements of this new, soon to be world-dominant artistic style. Richter’s interest in current affairs, popular culture, media, and the growing consumer society began to manifest itself increasingly in his paintings, like in President Johnson consoles Mrs. Kennedy, a piece created after the infamous Kennedy assassination. The paintings made in this period were created with the use of photographic images, something that had previously been inconceivable to him and to academic painting, and it marked the pivotal breakthrough. Now he was interested in exploring the relationship between the photographic image and painting, producing some of his first works to use techniques of blurring in 1963, like the piece titled Alster. By the time he left the Academy in summer of 1964, Richter had finally accepted his destiny of becoming a painter, and his true career could begin.   Pioneering an approach to painting through exploring the relationship between photography and painting, Richter was responsible for the process that was fundamental for the entire discourse of the post-WWII painting. At this time, two things were vital for him – representation by commercial and dynamic galleries; and opportunities for exhibitions. In summer of 1964, Munich-based gallerist Heiner Friedrich invited Richter to feature in the two-person exhibition together with Peter Klasen. Alfred Schmela, a Düsseldorf-based gallerist gave Richter his first solo show in September 1964. At around the same time, René Block opened his gallery in Berlin with a group show featuring Richter's work. He once again exhibited with Polke in November 1964, at Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal. It was a flying start into the world of commercial art, and Richter was able to pick whatever subject he wanted. And while he truly enjoyed painting eclectic subjects, he was naturally drawn to certain topics more than other. They were small affinities that became apparent over the course of the coming years. Family portraits, military aircraft and groups of people were characteristic of the artist’s work from this period. There was also a fascination with ideas of death and suffering, similarly to what Warhol did in his Disaster series. Pieces like Aunt Marianne, which was a family member who died as a direct result of the Third Reich, his maternal aunt who was institutionalized with mental health problems and left to die as part of the Nazi's eugenics program. During 1967, following the epiphany of Ema (Nude on a Staircase), works depicting women, nude and erotic images dominated his practice. In 1968, his focus shifted to aerial views of cities and towns. All things considered, the 60’s were good for Richter – he exhibited a lot and made some close relationships, like that with René Block. He also exhibited his works internationally, as part of group shows in Switzerland, the USA, and Japan. The 70’s brought some difficulties. Even though his career and reputation were gaining momentum, it didn’t seem that way to Richter. He became increasingly acquainted with Minimalism, Conceptualism, and Formalism, especially the work of Bruce Nauman and Sol LeWitt. Having first engaged geometric abstraction in 1966, through color charts, the artist returned to these in 1971, introducing the element of chance into the selection of colors, pursuing grids that would contain a higher number of colors than those produced in 1966. With the exception of 192 Colors, which was his re-departure point in many ways.  The Grey monochromes were also in his focus in 1966, broadly referred to as Grey Paintings. The genesis of the applied technique lies in his interest in Art Informel, where he used the sweeping, swirling path of the brush marks that were clearly visible, opposed to soft blurring that was used in his photo-paintings. Further evolution of these Inpaintings led to the creation of pieces, specifically designed to explore the borders between abstraction and figuration, like Two Women at Table. Photo-Enlargement was another technique through Richter was removing expression, and it drew significant attention. All of these – Color Charts, Grey Painting, Inpaintings, and Photo-Enlargements represent Richter’s efforts in exploring abstraction and attempts of dismantling the figurative painting. The possibilities of minimalism and abstraction were also in the center for American artists, such as Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Cy Twombly and Willem de Kooning. In 1977, Richter found two main routes forward – the first was the satisfactory conclusion to the inward logic of the monochrome, where the paintings were finally allowed to project outwards again, into the world, rather than spiraling inwards into itself and into the artist's own mind. His second breakthrough was the development of a substantial number of colorful abstract works he described simply as Abstraktes Bild. However, in personal life, not everything was going according to plan. Blinky Palermo, Richter’s close friend, died during a holiday in Maldives, and the artist’s marriage with Ema became strained and was obviously coming to an end. In the spring of 1979, they became formally separated.   Isa Genzken was the next person of interest for Richter. He had first been introduced to her in the early 70’s while she was studying, and the two were reacquainted in the late 70’s, just as his marriage with Ema was ending. They soon started living together in Düsseldorf and were married in 1982. The following year marked their move to Cologne, after having accepted a large studio space - an offer by his gallerist Rudolf Zwirner. With never-ending energy and enthusiasm, the artist continued to experiment in the field of abstraction, and the Abstract paintings dominated his practice until 1987. While fairly certain where he wanted to go with abstraction, the figurative work was problematic. Candles provided a quiet response between 1982 and 1983, becoming the primary subject. These paintings offered a fresh approach to Photo-Painting, but also served as a clear border between Richter and neo-expressionists. Landscapes were also a recurring motif in his work ever since his Corsica paintings, made in the late 60’s. In 1983 and 1984, the artist was preoccupied with something more down to earth, and so he depicted picturing rural farmland and the Rhineland, exemplified by works such as Barn. One of his most popular pieces was produced in 1988 – Betty is a portrait of Richter’s daughter from his first marriage when she was still a girl. Sitting close to the camera lens, wearing a red and white floral hooded cardigan, she faces away from the observer, seemingly into a gray void, one of her father’s gray abstract canvases. Richter’s fame was slowly raising, and by the end of 80’s, he was among the most prominent painters in both Germany and the world. Constantly selling in the international markets, his artworks reached a point of achievement that was now clearly matched by his status and reputation. In 1993, his marriage with Isa Genzken was over. A year later, Richter met the artist Sabine Moritz, fell in love with her and settled down for good.   At the beginning of a new millennium, the artist was increasingly focused on his Abstract Paintings. In 2001, glass was brought to center stage, with works such as 4 Standing Panes that demonstrated an obvious interest in pushing wall-based works into the realm of the sculptural. The major retrospective Forty Years of Painting was held at MoMA in 2002, it featured 190 works, and it was curated by Robert Storr. Silicate, a series of paintings of substantial size inspired by an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung came in 2003. Richter’s attention from serial work drifted shortly, in a form of a painting depicting the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. Titled simply September, it shows how Richter's painting raises and encapsulates many of the complex geopolitical issues that the attacks provoked. Having been previously asked in 2002 to replace the window on the Cologne Cathedral that was destroyed during WWII, the artist completed the project after five years of careful work. It’s his largest commission so far. Testing patterns and design concepts followed in 2008, accompanied by the series of colorful abstract pieces. One of the artist’s most recent avenues for the exploration of abstraction and color takes the form of stripes, realized in 2011 through a piece titled Strip.   Since his college days, Richter had a special relationship with several artists, including Konrad Fischer, Sigmar Polke, and Blinky Palermo, with all of them being friends but also artistic influences. As mentioned above, the artist was also influenced by Jackson Pollock, Lucio Fontana, Robert Rauschenberg, and Andy Warhol, but also by the artistic movements of Pop Art, Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, and even Dada. It’s important to mention the work of Hubert Roestenburg, who left a significant impression on Richter. Through his work, the artist helped in shaping the ideas of Minimalism and Conceptual Art, and he also influenced Ellsworth Kelly and Christopher Wool.   When an artist creates this many good works, it becomes really hard to point out the most significant ones. However, some do stand out, be it the name, political statement or something different. Mouth (Brigitte Bardot's Lips) (1963) was one of the first paintings to be completed from a photograph. Color Streaks (1968) is one the earliest gray paintings. 1024 Colors (1973) represents a systematic approach to the canvas. In 1976, the artist first named one of his pieces Abstract Painting. The most significant body of figurative work Richter produced in the 70’s was 48 Portraits, which took the form of 48 black-and-white canvases depicting famous western men from the previous two centuries, including scientists, composers, philosophers, and writers. He presents close-ups of their faces only, against plain gray backgrounds. It was one of the rare figurations when the artist produced mostly abstract work. The most politically provocative body of work up to date was created in 1988. The cycle of fifteen paintings was titled October 18, 1977, and it depicts the day when the saga of the Red Army Faction (RAF) came to an end with the suicide in prison of two of Germany's most notorious terrorists, Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin. The deaths were treated as a suicide despite the unusual circumstances. Made almost a decade after the original events, the series carried a powerful message, as the story was still a subject that divided opinion and touched a raw nerve among the German public. One of Richter’s most significant cycles of Abstract Paintings, Cage, was created in 2006. There are six large-scale canvases, inspired the music of the American avant-garde composer John Cage.    You must embrace everything that’s happening around you. Difficult decisions must be made and some will even be life-threatening. Emotional challenges are important as they provide endless inspiration, but can also cause some problems. Friends, fellow artists, anyone you can learn from – the knowledge is indescribably significant. This summarizes the life path of Gerhard Richter, one of the most famous contemporary artists, who’s been an inspiration for generations of artists. He is represented by Gagosian, Me Collectors Room Berlin, Weng Contemporary and Galerie Fluegel-Roncak.  ",640
Bridget Riley,"Known for her singular paintings which present the viewers with different illusions and effects, Bridget Riley is an abstract painter who came to fame during the American Op Art movement of the 1960s. Her paintings are all based on a concept of alluding on movement. Due to her contributions to her particular art movement, Riley's paintings have been presented alongside pieces made by such artists as Victor Vasarely, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly. Interestingly enough, Bridget did not claim that her influences could be found amongst any of those names also associated with the Op concepts - instead, she revealed that her greatest inspiration was the work of Georges Seurat. The Pointillist painter served as an influence to Riley because of his ability to construct patterned abstractions by using color and perception.   Bridget Riley was born in London during the year of 1931. Her father, whose name was John Fisher Riley, was originally from Yorkshire and was a printer by trade. In the year of 1938, John moved his printing business, together with his family, to the county of Lincolnshire. However, after the World War II broke out and the head of the family was drafted into the British army, Bridget went to Cornwall alongside her mother and sisters. It was in this rural environment that Riley received her informal education, mostly by listening to retired or non-qualified teachers. After the war, she attended Cheltenham Ladies' College and later studied at the Goldsmiths College and Royal College of Art. Interestingly, she was in the same class as Peter Blake, a painter who ultimately took another course of art making. After the graduation in 1955, Riley had been involved in a serious car crash and suffered a mental breakdown as a result. After much therapy and time, Bridget joined the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency as an illustrator. During the winter of 1958, the aspiring artist visited Jackson Pollock's show held at the Whitechapel Gallery and this experience had a massive impact on Bridget. However, her early pieces were much more figurative than Pollock's and had a semi-impressionist style. However, her early pieces were much more figurative than Pollock's and had a semi-impressionist style. Eventually, this practice grew into the aforementioned qazi-pointillist technique[1].   Somewhere around the year of 1960, Riley began to develop her signature Op Art style consisting of black and white geometric patterns that explore the dynamism of sight in order to produce a disorienting effect on the eye[2]. It took her about two years before she was finally in a position to present her illusions to the wider public. Bridget was given her first solo show by Victor Musgrave in 1962 and was held at the Studio One in London. Her pieces from the 1960s are the reason why her name is engraved in art history as Riley's variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement was without a doubt the highlight of her career. Some critics from the time went as far as stating that her art had a tendency to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasickness and skydiving. Interestingly, many works Bridgit authored depended heavily on the audience participation[3] - this is why her art was often related to the Happenings. In later parts of her career, Riley experimented much more with color than shapes, leading her to numerous stripe painting series. Additionally, the artist also explored the boundaries and abilities of contrast within her work. Bridget was even oftentimes prepared to let someone else paint her piece, leaving her to be concentrated only on the actual design of the work.   When Riley was once asked where her ultimate inspiration is usually found, many were surprised by her answer. The artist stated that nature and its wonders are what drives her, explaining it with the following: For me, nature is not a landscape, but the dynamism of visual forces—an event rather than an appearance. Not many saw this kind of comment coming, but it does make sense when one analyzes Bridget's shifting patterns of forms and changing, optical mixtures of colors. Ultimately, this was not the only thing that separated this painter from the rest of Op art representatives. What distinguishes Riley's art from her colleagues is the masterful use of gradients and variations in tone. And we do not see anyone overthrowing her in that regard any time soon. This artist is represented by David Zwirner London, David Zwirner 19th Street New York, Marlborough Fine Art London, Marlborough Gallery Monaco and David Zwirner 20th Street New York.

Willem de Kooning,"Undoubtedly one of the most crucial painters of the 20th century, Willem de Kooning was a renowned American-Dutch artist as well as a founding member of the Abstract Expressionist movement. Only truly rivaled by Jackson Pollock in terms of critical acclaim and public fame, de Kooning was arguably the most prominent and celebrated of all the Abstract Expressionist painters. His lusciously gestural oil paintings were very loosely based on figures, landscapes and still life compositions and they helped establish what can now be described as a distinctly American style of modern painting. The fact he maintained a commitment to the figurative tradition to some degree[1] makes this painter truly stand out from the rest of his famous contemporaries who opted for the pure abstraction style. Heavily influenced by Arshile Gorky and Pablo Picasso, de Kooning was often thought to have blended Cubism, Expressionism and Surrealism within his pictorial compositions, ultimately paving the way for generations of gestural figurative painters.  De Kooning was born during the year of 1904, in the Netherlands. He embraced the artistic path at a young age, dropping out of school when he was 12 years old so he could begin an apprenticeship in commercial design and interior decorating - dropping out of school in order to pursue a career in modern painting was not an unusual feat as many young artists opted to do so at that time. During this early period of his life, de Kooning took night classes at the Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts and Techniques. When he turned the age of 16, Willem landed his first job in the industry as he was given an opportunity to work with the art director of a large department store. However, his life did not seem to get any better after he found a job. In 1926, de Kooning stowed away on a ship bound for the United States as he was hoping that the fabled US scene of art will prove to be a much more rewarding place for a young, aspiring artist. He jumped from various jobs in the Northeast until he eventually settled in New York City.  Although he had no problems finding a job in the Big Apple, Willem was not able to dedicate himself to his creative pursuits. He worked for several years in commercial art and things seemed as if they did not change all too much from the time he worked a similar job in the Netherlands. However, de Kooning was able to find a like-minded group of artists in New York who encouraged him to paint for himself, to get himself as far away as possible from commercial art. Around the year of 1928, he began painting still lifes and human figures, but it wasn’t long before he was dabbling in more abstract works as he was becoming increasingly more influenced by the likes of the aforementioned Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró[2]. His true breakthrough was in the year of 1935 when Willem was chosen to be the official artist of the federal art project for the WPA (Works Progress Administration) that needed him to paint a number of murals and other similar works.  In 1936, de Kooning’s work was a big part of a Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) exhibit titled as New Horizons in American Art. This early career highlight was unfortunately overshadowed during the following year when Willem's job with the WPA came to an abrupt end - he was forced to resign because he was not an American citizen. Soon after that event, de Kooning began a series of male figures, resulting in many pieces such as Seated Figure (Classic Male) and Two Men Standing. He also hired an apprentice, Elaine Fried, and she would sit as a female subject for many of his works - Seated Woman (1940) comes to mind almost immediately. This piece will prove to be the artist's first major painting of a woman as de Kooning will go on to be mainly known for his decades-long work in depicting women in his paintings.[3]   After they got married in 1943, de Kooning and Fried would have a hotheaded, alcohol-soaked life together before finally separating in the late 1950s. Artistically, de Kooning kept on with his figure depictions while also branching out into more abstract types of work as well. These abstract pieces continued to reveal the presence of human forms within them for the entirety of the painter's career. Willem's two artistic approaches finally merged in the 1945 piece titled as Pink Angels, one of his first significant contributions to Abstract Expressionism. Soon, de Kooning become a central figure in the Abstract Expressionism movement. De Kooning's famous black paintings are also important to the history of this loosely defined style of American painting due to their conceptual core, densely impacted forms and mixed media technique. In the mid-1950s, he turned his abstract sights to landscape painting and so the series Abstract Urban Landscapes (1955-58), Abstract Parkway Landscapes (1957-61) and Abstract Pastoral Landscapes (1960-66) came to be. These landscape works would help define an entire creative era in the author's artistic life as the turn towards them was a surprising feat to the entire scene.   Although the landscape pieces became the focal point of his mature career, the female figure remained an important symbol for de Kooning’s art and his whole life. Depictions of woman manifested in de Kooning’s paintings and drawings as a result of desires, frustrations, inner conflicts, pleasures. Early abstract works and mature landscape paintings were also deeply conceptually rooted within the author's mind, but the portrayal of women remains Willem's most intimate creative output. In 1961, de Kooning finally became an American citizen and settled in East Hampton, New York. During the mid-1970s, de Kooning and Fried reunited and remained together until her death in 1989. He continued working throughout the 1980s[4], but the onset of Alzheimer's disease destroyed his memory and severely impaired his ability to work. After his wife died in 1989, de Kooning’s daughter cared for him until the moment of his death in 1997. Willem was 92 years old at the time.   Although everyone was constantly stating that de Kooning loved combining aspects of Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism, this American-Dutch painter actually opposed the restrictions imposed by naming movements and categorizing works of art. In fact, he was widely recognized as an Abstract Expressionist, yet he never fully abandoned the depiction of the human figure[5]. Such facts lead us to believe that the art of de Kooning created an artistic realm to itself, unbounded by any set of predefined rules or already established visual standards. His early pure abstract paintings, celebrated female depictions and mature landscape pieces - all these works represent what can easily be classified as true milestones of modern art history and are a clear indicator of just how vital the work of Willem de Kooning truly was.

Harland Miller,"Harland Miller is a British artist born in 1964 in Yorkshire, UK. He is a notable artist and writer who has contributed to the Abstract Art and Figurative Art movement in the 21st century. Miller earned his BA and MA in Art History from the Chelsea College of Art in London, UK. After receiving his degrees, Miller traveled extensively throughout Germany and the United States. He moved to New York, where he lived and worked for several years whilst exhibiting at the Prisunic Gallery. In 1992 he moved back to Europe, first to newly reunified Berlin where he began writing. By 1994 he was living and working in Paris, where he exhibited at the Galerie Louis XIV. After more extensive travels Miller eventually returned to the UK in 1996 where he carried on writing as well as painting. In 2000, Miller achieved critical acclaim for his first novel, Slow Down Arthur, Stick to Thirty, which featured a young boy who travels around England on adventures with a David Bowie impersonator. In 2001, the artist painted a series of paintings based on the covers of Penguin classic dust covers. In this series, Miller combined Pop Art, Abstraction, and Figurative paintings. He continues to create works with this theme. Miller was named the Writer in Residence at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, MA, in 2002. This was followed by his first one-man show, To Jean – A Small Memento of a Great Effort, at the White Cube Gallery in 2003. Miller combined both writing and painting when he curated a group show at the White Cube gallery, You Dig The Tunnel, I’ll Hide The Soil, in 2009, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Edgar Allan Poe. Poe has been a consistent source of inspiration to Miller's work. The exhibit was housed in two separate venues in London. Some of his notable solo shows include Dear Son, This Is One Of The Last Of My Few Remaining Pre-Marital Possessions – Look After It Won’t You…Love Dad, Marian Boesky Gallery, New York, Don’t Let The Bastards Cheer You Up, The Baltic Museum, I’ll Never Forget What I Can’t Remember, The Reflex Gallery, Amsterdam, Butterside Down, Galleria Maribini, Bologna. Miller lived and exhibited his work in New York, Berlin, and New Orleans. He currently lives and works in London.",643
Kiki Smith,"Widely known for her sculptures, prints, and drawings, Kiki Smith is a German-born American contemporary artist, who focuses on narrative, the human condition, and the natural world. Coming from a family whose artistic potential is almost immeasurable, she was able to materialize the potential into something tangible, creating an oeuvre that is acclaimed and appreciated throughout the world. With themes such as death, sexuality, and gender, the artist addressed the largest audience possible, but that was by no means a signal to sink into mediocre work. Instead, Smith has kept an insanely high level of quality, evolving over time, embracing and speaking courageously of the inevitable.    As mentioned above, her family was (and still is) art-oriented. Smith was born in Nuremberg, Germany, where her mother, Jane Lawrence, was working as an actress and opera singer. Her father was Tony Smith, an American sculptor, one of the creators of Minimalism, known for his large-scale geometric works in steel. They had three daughters, Kiki, and one-year-younger twins, Seton and Beatrice. Seton had showed an interest in visual arts from an early age, eventually becoming a successful photographer, while Beatrice shared her mother’s passion for theater. Sadly, she died from complications caused by AIDS in 1988, making Kiki and Seton even more connected. Observed from outside, the family house in South Orange, New Jersey looked the same as all the ones around. On the inside, an entirely different aesthetic prevailed. These were the 60s and early 70s, and three sisters were growing up completely surrounded by Abstract Expressionist paintings by family friends and frequent visitors like Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, and Barnet Newman, but also by the Minimalist sculptures made by their father, Tony.[1] With abstract expressionism dominating their living environment, the sisters were aware of della Francesca, da Vinci, Matisse and Bonnard, but for example, didn’t know anything about Andrew Wyeth until they went to college.  As a teenager, Smith started making craft-oriented art, approaching things in a more symbolic, figurative way. Those early crafts soon became something more complex. She engaged art-making as a part-time thing, deciding to pledge herself entirely only after her father’s death in 1980. That sad occasion was accompanied by the untimely death of her sister Beatrice eight years later, pushing Smith further into the examination of the inevitable death. Since she makes drawings, prints, sculptures, videos, photographs, and tapestry, it can be a challenging task of categorizing Smith’s work. As the artist states: “Creativity is just the capacity of consciousness. It is a way to synthesize. It is a good language to ground your consciousness in a condensed manner that you can see physically outside yourself.” However, the basic way of making things is similar to how she made things all her life, and she makes changes depending on the changes in her life.[2] There are several artists that made an impression on her, as she recalls seeing Picasso’s Guernica at MoMA when she was a child, but also the Oceanic prints on cloth by Matisse and then Van Gogh’s Starry Night. She went to Colmar five times to see the Isenheim Altar by Grünewald. Speaking of people closer to her generation, there are Rob Voerman, Peter Buggenhout, Leon Golub.   When it comes to female artist influences, Smith points out Frida Kahlo, Lee Bontecou, Eva Hesse, Nancy Spero, Pat Steir, and Sonia Delaunay. Asian art is also an influence, both back in her formative years, and now. Growing up in the 60s, in a very overt way, India was very present in the cultural imaging. Then China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. “At different times I paid more attention to one over another. It moves around what influences you. Certainly today Asian art is a dominant influence.”[3] Buddhism is also quite influential in people’s thoughts on art. Smith is particularly interested in Guanyin. Naturally, representation changes over different time periods, so she looks at Japanese fashion, Egyptian things, etc. Speaking of recent exhibitions, in 2014, Smith participated with Jaume Plensa and Barthélémy Toguo in a group show at Lelong Gallery. The trio of artists comes from the same generation, but from very different backgrounds. It was a wonderful opportunity to see three extinguished sculptors at the same place and at the same time.  In 2016, there were two major shows. First, Gallery C218 presented Kiki Smith and Tony Smith: Masterpiece in Focus. The name of the show pretty much tells the tale – one next to another, there are artworks from two masters that have each marked their own generation. Belonging to the opposite artistic movements (Kiki’s aligning with figuration and Tony’s with Minimalism and Abstraction) the exhibited pieces offer equally compelling meditations on the presence, embodiment and consciousness. And second - on May 13, Smith’s latest solo show Woven Tales opened at Peters Projects. It represents the culmination of her interest in tapestry, showing that the approach she took is similar to artists of the past. The artist filled her work with emblematic imagery and referencing the compositional components of historic weaving. Consisting of 11 large-scale tapestries, the exhibition shows that her pieces should be read as narrative pieces, but their imagery suggests open-ended meanings with variable interpretations. Each tapestry in started with Smith making what is called a cartoon, a full-scale model of the design. After that comes photographing, working on a computer, reworking by hand – a series of stages with a lot of translation happening.    With a career spanning almost four decades, Smith is yet to face any sort of repetition, consolidation, completion, conformity, or depletion in her never-ending quest of describing and establishing a discourse of the meta-body. Since reality is brutally honest, she tirelessly continues to produce new pieces. She's also forging an even greater definition and expansive resonance to the individual and collective implications inherent in those works. As people are increasingly forced to finally face the unavoidable and inescapable questions of sexuality, gender, health, and self that Smith has been tackling all along, the art world has come to understand her work more deeply and profoundly.  She is represented by Pace Gallery.  References:",644
Ugo Rondinone,"Ugo Rondinone is a Swiss installation artist best known for his spray paintings and video environments that bear a  strong sense of melancholy and alienation. The artist is based in New York and his themes usually try to find a middle ground between fantasy and reality, dancing on a razor's edge of euphoria and depression. This phenomenal artist has been active for years now, never failing to bring us fresh and original pieces that continue to amaze us to this day. Besides installations, Ugo is also quite active in creating sculpture pieces. [caption id=""attachment_254543"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Ugo  Rondinone - I Love John Giorno[/caption]  Ugo Rondinone was born during the year of 1964, in Brunnen, a town in Switzerland. He was born to Italian parents and started showing signs of artistic tendencies from early on. In 1983, Ugo moved to Zurich in order to become the assistant to Hermann Nitsch, an Austrian artist who works in experimental and multimedia modes. This was Ugo's first contact with professional art. Rondinone acquired his education by studying at the Hochschule für Angewandte Kunst in Vienna, where he graduated in 1990. His official career started in the 1990s, in a time he created a series of circular paintings that were simply titled using numbers and many critics thought they resembled Kenneth Noland’s target works. Soon he became the subject of international attention as his work started to expand and evolve. Technically speaking, Rondinone worked with different media, such as photography, video, sculpture, and drawing - and he also regularly used more or less familiar quotations from literature and popular culture, appropriately placing them where he saw fit. Ever since his early days as a professional artist, Rondinone has shown what type of pieces he likes creating - the ones that tempt the viewer into a meditative state, much alike the way aforementioned target-shaped paintings lure the audience into their brightly colored, concentric rings.   [caption id=""attachment_254544"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Ugo Rondinone - Moonrise Sculptures[/caption]  To get a clearer picture of how Ugo works, let us give you an example - for his series titled I Don’t Live Here Anymore (1995), the artist digitally altered images of fashion models in erotic poses so that his facial features replaced those of the female subjects. Such humor is ever present in Ugo's portfolio. During his career, Rondinone focused much attention on signage as well, exampled by such pieces as the rainbow-colored Hell, Yes!, a now-iconic sculpture that stood on the facade of the New Museum in New York. Another similar piece is the famous Our Magic Hour, or the Dog Days Are Over, a sign that was presented at Zurich's Museum für Gegenwartskunst in 1996 and mystically proclaimed an end to a period of turmoil. Ugo has also dabbled in some more morbid artistic waters, like the time he created the installation Roundelay  in 2003, a melancholic piece in which the focal point was the six video projection of a man and woman walking through the streets of Paris. The key to this piece was the music score authored by the composer Philip Glass which evoked a strong sense of alienation. Today, Ugo seems a bit more interested in sculpture then installations, creating some pretty extraordinary pieces of the medium. In 2013, he presented a piece titled Human Nature, a group of monumental stone figures in Rockefeller Center that resembled primitive robotic creatures created from the rocks of Stonehenge. However, the artist did not quit the installation craft, with his most recent piece titled Seven Magic Mountains (2016) and displayed alongside Interstate 15 just south of Las Vegas. Rondinone has held or was a part of numerous exhibitions organized at countless museums around the world. The most prestigious locations where he has displayed his work are the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla in Leon. It should also be noted that Ugo has represented Switzerland at the 52nd Venice Biennale during the year of 2002.   [caption id=""attachment_254545"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Ugo Rondinone - Hell Yes[/caption]  As you could have seen for yourself, Ugo's art has been constantly evolving and changing over the years. Such versatility and variety show us that the work of Rondinone has been undeniably chained to the development of his own personality and the different phases of life the artist went through at the time he created his pieces. Ultimately, it should be noted that Ugo simply is not capable of failing - no matter which goal he set for his art, he always managed to  fulfill it. He made us laugh, he made us cry, he made us reflect, he made us believe. Not many artists are able of achieving such results. The artist is represented by Robert Fontaine Gallery in Miami and Weng Contemporary in Zug.

Georges Braque,"Having the long painting career that started from the Impressionist and Fauvist visual language, Georges Braque found himself at the forefront of the revolutionary and progressive art movement of Cubism. Side by side with one of the greatest names of the 20th-century art, George Braque collaborated along with Pablo Picasso creating iconic works that were used as the direction for the future generations of artists. Always focused on the overview of the objects seen from different perspectives depending on color, line, or texture, it was natural that his acquaintance with Picasso resulted in such an explosion of innovations. Although same in the palette, style, and themes, their pieces differed for Braque’s deprivation of iconological commentary and interest only in pictorial space and composition. Searching for harmony and balance through the new technique of collage with the use of pasted paper named papier collés, the painter went one step further by incorporating advertisements clippings into his canvases.  Braque was born in 1882 in Argenteuil, Val-d’Oise and grew up in Le Havre where his father managed a decorative painting business. Working with him as a decorator, he developed his first interests in art, starting to study painting during evenings at Ecole des Beaux-Arts. At the age of 17, he moved to Paris to attend the Academia Humbert until 1904. During this period, he created his first paintings in a Fauvist style, under the influence of Henry Matisse and debuted at the exhibition at the Salon des Independants in 1906. Progressively changing the style, he was under the impression of Paul Cezanne’s works which he saw on a large retrospective show held one year after his death. After the visit to Picasso’s studio, Braque became totally fascinated by his Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, developing a close friendship and artistic collaboration with the already famous artist: ""We would get together every single day to discuss and assay the ideas that were forming, as well as to compare our respective works""[1]. From 1908, he started to show interest in geometry and simultaneous perspective, exploring the effects of light and techniques used for achievement of these effects. Reducing the architectural structures to a geometric form on his paintings, he shaded it making the illusion of both flat and three-dimensional image. One faced with Picasso’s approach, Braque began to use more expressive implementation of constructive elements along with Fauvist visual language. His distinctive landscapes from this period, reduced to basic shapes and colors, inspired French art critic Louis Vauxcelles to call them the “bizarreries cubiques” which later resulted with the term Cubism, for the first time officially used in 1911 with reference to the exhibition at the Salon des Indenpendants[2]. Braque’s and Picasso’s collaboration and mutual influences were marked with both similarities and differences, but the fact was that they equally contributed to the development of Cubism in 1908, using the monochromatic palette and complex patterns of faceted form in their paintings that would be later named Analytic Cubism. During summer 2011, two artists painted side by side, producing almost identical pieces. One year later, they started revolutionary experimentation with collages, inventing the papier colle technique.   When the World War I began, Braque joined the French Army where he suffered the head injury in a battle and experienced temporary blindness as a consequence. After the long period of recuperation, he noticed the change in his friend’s style who started to paint figuratively. Taking it as a betrayal of their Cubist convictions, Braque decided to continue on his own. “The things that Picasso and I said to one another during those years will never be said again, and even if they were, no one would understand them anymore. It was like being roped together on a mountain”[3]. Still, the artist continued to be influenced by Picasso’s work, creating collages of pieces of musical instruments and furniture that were crucial for the later development of the Cubist sculpture. Feeling the saturation with this technique, by 1918, Braque has returned to still lifes. His first postwar solo exhibition held in 1919 showed the change of palette toward limitations of tones and strict adherence to the Cubist rules of multi-faceted geometrical shapes. Completely dedicated to the exploration of perspectives and depicting space in different ways, Braque was even designed sets and costumes for theater performances during the 1920’s. Over the time, his style became more personal, showing the tendencies toward human figure after his move to the Normandy seacoast. He again started to explore the landscape, now using bright colors influenced by Picasso and Matisse. After the 1930’s he focused on portraits of Greek mythology heroes, deprived of the symbolism, seen through a purely formal lens, considering these works for exercise for line and shape. Haunted by the themes of death and suffering, the artist painted Vanitas series which have reflected his obsession with the physicality of paintings when he searched the new techniques of the brushstrokes and colors to emphasize the subject matter. Braque’s selection of subjects was always the expression of his personal convictions, often with a hidden meaning[4]. His last series Atelier, made from 1948 to 1955 consisted of eight canvases imbued with the objects from his inner thoughts rather that the observations of the world around. Shortly before his death, he painted birds repeatedly, reflecting his obsession with space and movement.   Recognized and celebrated as the father of Cubism, Georges Braque’s approach was both rational and sensuous, deeply committed to his convictions that he followed during his whole career. His technique was characteristic for the use of pigment blended with sand and copies of wood grain or marble with the aim of achieving more convincing impression of dimension. His still lifes were so abstract that they seemed more like an indication of the object but its direct representations. Braque died on August 31, 1963, in Paris and was buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Valery in Varengeville-sur-Mer in Normandy whose windows he designed. References:   ",646
Magnus Plessen,"A German artist, Magnus Plessen is best known for a painting style that combines additive and subtractive techniques, employing both brush and spatula. Shifting fluidly between abstraction and representation, his works are studies on perception, structure, material and transience. Born in 1967 in Hamburg, Germany, Plessen currently lives and works in Berlin. He worked for several years as a photographer and filmmaker before turning to painting in the year 2000. He has exhibited around the world, including venues such as the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Massachusetts, Art Institute of Chicago, Espace 315, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, K21, Düsseldorf, Germany, MoMA PS1, New York, Museu Serralves, Porto, Portugal and Sammlung Goetz, Munich. He has participated in the 50th Venice Biennale (2003). Plessen's work is characterized by tactile and expressive brushwork, rendering the subject elusive whilst also confounding any fixed viewpoint. He develops images systematically, using the application and removal of paint to reveal passages of compact form and negative space, a technique which evokes Richter's paintings. Emerging in rigorous and dynamic syncopation, the physicality of the painting is held in constant check by the push and pull of space. His images are characterized by a rhythm and structure that makes them, quite literally, fields of observation.",647
Trudy Benson,"Trudy Benson is an American abstract artist born in 1985, known for her large-scale paintings that utilize large swaths and globs of paint. She was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1985.

Hiro Ichikawa,"Hiro Ichikawa is a Japanese abstract artist, known for his oil paintings which he creates on wooden panels. His art is heavily influenced by nature. Hiro Ichikawa was born in Osaka, Japan in 1959. A child of kimono makers, Hiro's childhood was filled with the abundance of traditionally designed, intensely colored silk materials, which influenced him and set him on a path to become a successful artist. Ichikawa spent his formative years learning the art of drawing and painting – he received his academic training at Suidobata Art Academy in Tokyo. However, he soon realized that he was attracted to Western art, so he traveled to New York in 1980, in order to learn and expand his artistic horizon. In 1984, he obtained a BFA degree from Pratt Institute, and made a decision to remain in New York.  Soon, Hiro rose to prominence in New York, and later in his native country, which ensured him many shows and exhibitions. Looking for a better studio, and a place which would instill new dimensions into his art, Ichikawa moved to Beacon, New York in 2001, where he still resides. The scenic environment of his new dwelling did just that – his studio is surrounded by mountains and rivers.  Ichikawa believes that contemporary art traditional Japanese art have a lot in common. Guided by this thought, the artist's work strives towards capturing traditional san-sui paintings in  modern light. San-sui paintings depict non-existent landscapes; they are fruits of artists' imagination. Hiro's paintings, however, are not straight depictions of the landscape. Instead, he tries to capture the substance and spirit of nature, and to transfer it onto a wooden panel. He applies small dots and points of paint to the surface, creating multitudes of them, giving the elements of his paintings shapes and density. Ichikawa is a printmaker as well. His most famous etching series is Aether where he employs the same kinds of patterns and style that he does in his landscape paintings.  Hiro has displayed his works all over the East Coast and in his native Japan. His artworks have been a part of numerous group exhibitions, like Paper Invitational at Woodward Gallery, and 2005's Winter Paper Seven. Hiro's paintings were shown side by side with the works of such art giants as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. Since 1993, Ichikawa has displayed his works every year in Japan at Mogi Gallery in Kiryu. He also had one-man shows at Maya Gallery in Osaka and Gallery Q in Tokyo. He is now represented by Woodward Gallery in New York.  ",649
Marisol Escobar,"Marisol Escobar was born in Paris, France in 1930. Her given name was Maria Sol Escobar, but she preferred to be called just Marisol. The name Marisol became her artistic persona and her identity during the 1950's when she started showing her sculptures at many New York exhibitions. She was an American artist of Venezuelan descent. Her most significant items are her boxlike figurative sculptures. Marisol fundamentally used wood, but she combined it with other materials, such as glass, plastic, bronze, door knobs, and even shoes and sneakers. She used various fabrics on her wooden sculptures, in addition to collage paper. Along with the wooden carvings, she also painted and mixed different styles into her intriguing woodwork. She rose to fame in the 1960's for her mixed media, human-size figures. They were usually positioned in groups, and they represented families, a group of friends, public figures or sometimes different faces and moods of herself. Escobar is often linked to Pop Art movement, although she consolidated various different styles into her carvings. She is famous for the creations such as The Last Supper, that was inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci and her personal faith, in addition to pieces such as The Party, and The Kennedy family portraits.  During her lavish childhood, she lived in Venezuela, and various European countries, and the United States. After the suicide of her mother, Josefina Hernandez, that occurred when Marisol was 11 years old, the Escobars settled in Los Angeles, United States. Josefina Escobar had been a patron of the arts in Venezuela, and young Marisol, at the age of 16, started studying art at the Jepson School in Los Angeles. Encouraged by her father, Gustavo who worked in the real estate, Marisol went to Paris, France, and enrolled at the prestigious art school Ecole des Beaux Arts in 1949. She was not happy with the strict and akin education in Paris and after a year of studying she left for the USA. When she got back to New York she started taking courses at the Art Students League of New York. Her teacher was Yasuo Kuniyoshi who made a huge impact on how her style developed over the years. Under his influence, she started getting into naive and ornamental style. Along with the Kuniyoshi courses, she enrolled at the New School for Social Research, where her mentor was Hans Hofmann, the so-called dean of Abstract Expressionism.   In 1951, the Marisol was introduced to Pre-Columbian artifacts, which led her to abandon painting and start sculpting. Apart from a clay molding class at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, Escobar was a self-taught sculptor. Her fist solo exhibition took place in 1957 Leo Castelli Gallery in New York. In the 1960s, her works were influenced by Pop Art and the artist such as Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, in whose two films she appeared (The Kiss and 13 Most Beautiful Girls). Along with her artistic success, she was also a cultural icon. Marisol lived on a strict and firm principles. She thought that the artistic talent was crucial for creativity, but also that hard work is the only road to success. Her wit and charisma fascinated art critiques and her fellow colleagues. She believed that she was born as an artist and that her life mission is just to explain that to other people. Her faith was very important to her, and she believed in herself and positive values, more than anything. Marisol was a spiritual person, and she started exploring religion and faith at an early age. She was fiercely independent and she never let anyone label her, or her work. She made sculptures out of pure passion and exposed her sentimental side through her wood carvings.  Leo Castelli invited her to participate in a group show in 1957 with artist Jasper Johns and Rauschenberg. That was the year she had her first solo exhibition, too. Soon after those events she moved to Rome, where she spent two years taking a creative break from all her work.   When she came back to New York after some time in Italy, she soon regained her fame and popularity in the art world. At MOMA, she participated in the The Art of Assemblage exhibition in 1961, and two years later she was given her own space to exhibit her works for the Americans, 1963. In 1968, she showed her work at the Venice Biennale. During those years, she changed her style and the characteristics of her art. Marisol started making more naive, folk art and she let her mysterious side take over her creative output. She was no stranger to opaque and dark themes, and she often named her works using disturbing captions. She mixed wooden carvings with different fabrics, drawings, and random objects that she found and implemented in her pieces. Her wooden figurines were always placed facing the audience, like some sort of modern totems. In The Family collection she made the characters wear real shoes and sneakers. The Kennedys carvings are a real example of modern totems, too.   Marisol did not want to be labeled as a Pop Art artist. In fact, she did not want to be labeled at all. She was a very spirited character and favored silence and solitude over fame and glory. She was a very beautiful woman, and at the time she was an it-girl, but her elegance and style transcended the range of ordinary New York art scene. In 1997, she was awarded Premio Gabriela Mistral by the Organization of American States, and for her work she received Honorary Doctorates from Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, Rhode Island School of Design, and New York State University. In 2014, a major retrospective and scholarly catalog of artist's work at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art in Memphis, Tennessee, helped her regain the international attention and interest. Her vivacious personality made her one of the most praised and loved artist. Marisol was known for her silence and grace. She never spoke too much publicly about her personal life or her creative career. Instead, her work spoke for her. She gave the world wonderful creations, full of joy and cleverness. ",650

Steve Kaufman,"Considered to be a legend Steve Kaufman is one of the last Pop artists known for depicting the revered cultural icons. The artist has made an exceptional oeuvre infused with elements of graffiti art, popular culture, and advertising. Kaufman was a sculptor, fine artist, filmmaker, humanitarian, and photographer. At the age of 19, he entered the world of art when he started working at the Factory studio as an assistant to Andy Warhol. The artist's work was exhibited in numerous museums and galleries, including The Pop Culture Gallery at The World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, the Blues & Legends Hall of Fame Museum in Memphis, TN, and the Reiss-Engelhorn Museum in Mannheim, Germany.   Steve Kaufman, born in 1960 in New York, was a middle child in a family of artists. From an early age, he was surrounded by painters and sculptors who thought him to always change and try different art forms. The artist’s first solo exhibition was at the Jewish Temple in the Bronx when he was just eight years old. At 15, he was part of a group show at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As a student at the School of Visual Arts, he regularly attended parties at Studio 54 where he was surrounded by artists of the New York art scene of the 70s. At this time, he met Andy Warhol, who gave him the nickname SAK. Working in Andy’s Factory was instrumental in shaping Kaufman’s artistic style. There he learned techniques that he used for the rest of his life, such as silkscreen with oils. During his time with Andy, Kaufman sold his artwork to Calvin Klein, designed theme parties in various clubs around New York, participated in AIDS demonstrations for which he was once arrested.     After leaving the Factory, Kaufman opened SAK Studio, where he employed homeless people to help him. In his youth, he was friends with Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Time spent with these artists inspired him to do humanitarian work, that led to hiring not only homeless people but trebled teens and convicted convicts. Kaufman was fascinated with the virtues of fame, which inspired him to paint everything from celebrity portraits to brand names. Coca-Cola and the Statue of Liberty were among his most favorite subjects, including the portraits depicting famous icons such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, Sinatra, James Dean. Even though he was more inclined toward mass production, the artist preferred to create hand-painted oil paintings.   Few artists have had such a versatile career as Steve Kaufman. He has worked with Stan Lee on Marvel comics and had artwork personally signed by Muhammad Ali, Fidel Castro, and John Travolta. The artist created new styles of painting, museum art and portrait collage. An example of portrait collage art are the  iconic artworks, such as Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Kennedy, and Rat Pack. The September 11 Memorial Painting created in memory of the World Trade Center attack is the best example of museum art. Steve Kaufman died at the age of 49 in 2004. ",654
Nicole Pon Horvath,"For those of you believing in reincarnation, imagine how incredible would it be if you could actually remember some of your past lives! All of you, who don’t believe in such a thing, imagine some kind of mystical and inexplicable feel that guides you through live, helping you in making all the important decisions. Nicole Pon Horvath, also known as NH, is an artist born in France, raised in Algeria, but as she openly admits, a Japanese deep in her soul. Well, not in this life, but in some of her previous ones certainly. However, it was a specific life choice that led to the discovery of her affinities towards all the nuanced details that can be seen in Japanese art. After moving to Japan with her husband due to his work, Horvath suddenly found herself in a situation with enough time on her hands to freely pursue her childhood passion of using her own hands in artistic endeavors. The sky was the very first thing she’d noticed upon arriving at her new home, and the color was reminiscent and evoked some happy memories of Algeria.   Having felt that she’d finally arrived where she was destined to be, Horvath began taking photographs of her immediate surroundings, with close up shots of foliage and small details. There were the feelings of calm and piece, and she wanted to capture those precious moments so she could be able to recall them later on. As her artistic journey slowly began, she did what most of us do upon finding ourselves in an unknown place – she found a guide. A sensei to teach her. Shoko Ohta, a classically trained master, encouraged Horvath to work in black and white until she felt ready to move on to color. She soon discovered that it’s a quite unusual process to learn to execute, with layers upon layers of workmanship. Several years later, the artist returned to Provence. Having temporarily lost her focus, she cut herself from everyone and everything. A couple of weeks later, she emerged with a unique point of view and several completed paintings that represented a basis for her first solo exhibition. Her sensei came and was the first to see the pieces, giving her approval. Showing the stunning minimalism apparent in many Japanese art-forms, all of Horvath’s works offer viewers a feeling of serenity.  ",655

Kevin Appel,"An American artist, Kevin Appel is known for works that relate to both abstract painting and architecture. Exploring the environmental, social, and psychological impact of architecture, Appel was born in 1967 in Lose Angeles, California, where she still lives and works.

He is a Professor and Associate Chair of Graduate Studies at the University of California Irvine. Drawing inspiration from the structures and surroundings of his hometown of Los Angeles, Appel began depicting stylized interiors of homes, over the years shifting his focus to the exteriors of homes and other buildings, which he would deconstruct and recombine into roiling, semi-abstract forms in large-scale compositions. Occupying spaces within and between the practices of painting and architecture, these works follow ;a trajectory describing the slow and messy dissolution of the integrity of the house, home, and pictorial space.",658

Julia Mangold,"A German contemporary artist, Julia Mangold is known for minimalist sculptures that explore shape, form and materiality. At once rigorous and formal, yet also very sensual, her works are of an almost classical beauty due to their proportions and surface. Born in Munich in 1966, Julia Mangold currently lives and works between Munich and Portland. She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1992 to 1996.

Massive in their substance and seemingly remote, Mangold's works are characterized by the reduction, purity, equanimity and sensuous, emotional aura, offering an experience of extraordinary perception. Perfect and timeless thanks to their form and their proportions, these works are a source of intellectual power. ",661

She trained and worked as a civil engineer in Prague. For a long time, painting has been her joy and a great hobby, but sadly, she didn’t have enough tie for it. After moving to Singapore in 2011, she took the opportunity to pursue art and started painting again, even taking lessons from Singaporean academic painter Wee Shoo Leong. Kurkova also spent four months studying under American portrait painter Clayton Hudnall. “I love painting, as it gives me a sense of freedom and great relaxation.

Inspired by the great Abstract Expressionists from the late ’40s and early ’50s (Willem de Kooning, Joan Mitchell, and Lee Krasner, to name a few), her “art is about taking color and creating a joyous feeling.” At first, Marra was working in oils and realism, always feeling something was missing. Switching to acrylics and abstraction provided a visual voice to her inner world.

Floyd Elzinga,"Floyd Elzinga is a Canadian sculptor whose works depict iconic imagery from the Canadian landscape, the maple leaf, pine branch, and pine cone. Drawn to the distinction between polar opposites and with duality as an underlying theme of his work, he creates conceptual sculptures using metals. Some of his pieces diverge from the traditional three-dimensional sculptural approach and are more “two-dimensionally.” Elzinga’s current work focuses on seeds, more specifically pine cones. The cone is chosen not only for its complicatedly beautiful geometric natural form but more so for the fact that it is a seed. He studied at the Nova Scotia College of Art & Design in Halifax, NS, where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts. Floyd Elzinga lives next to his studio in Beamsville, Ontario.   ",669
Melanie Simard,"Constantly researching and experimenting, Mélanie Simard is a Canadian contemporary artist known for her colorful paintings. She began studying various art techniques when she was just nine years old, and after years of experience, acrylic paint has become her medium of choice. Already known as Mélan, she had established herself as a still-life painter. However, wanting to explore new possibilities and mediums as an artist, she eventually came in contact with a cold and rigid substance called aluminum. Simard mounts the aluminum foil on textured canvas, giving the metal a new life in this environment. Her vibrant palette of colors in combination with her thoughts and emotions, written in simple words, gives her works the ability to make the viewers more aware of the time, the life, and the space that surround them.

Lena Zak,"Focusing on Abstract Expressionism, Lena Zak is an emerging Czech mixed-media painter known for her bold, gestural compositions. The purpose of painting is not just to express, but also to challenge herself. Greatly influenced by her current environment and the state of her mind, the paintings represent Zak’s intense emotions. Her process begins with a close observation of the world around her with a different set of eyes or by meditating and trying to be as present as possible. While creating the piece, she lets the spontaneous gestures take over, inspired by both what she saw and felt. Predominantly working with acrylic, she uses atypical materials found at places that left strong impressions on her. Instead of brushes, Zak utilizes leaves, textiles, flowers, wood, grass, and many more. Though abstract, her works are rooted in the observation of reality, and using those specific materials gives the paintings an “even stronger connection with the environment where they were created and which they essentially represent.” Lena Zak lives and works in Prague.

Miriam Aroeste,"Miriam Aroeste is a Canadian contemporary artist whose work has both abstract visual appeal as well as an underlying conceptual basis. She has always been interested in “depicting authentic, spontaneous emotion and experience in colorful, abstract ways, finding beauty and satisfaction in that which is intensely genuine and ultimately imperfect.” Fascinated by the inner working of the mind, impulse and defense, conscious and unconscious thought, Aroeste utilizes the power of color, line, and space to create visually captivating works. She hopes that her paintings will provoke and evoke personal narratives in viewers, allowing them to search for and find new meaning over time.

Lloyd Tabing,"Lloyd Tabing is an American-born abstract painter whose works are distinctive and powerful yet provide a sense of elegance and simplicity. In today’s overwhelmingly hectic world, he searches for simplicity in his environment, both natural and built. Inspired by the sense of space, his paintings are an extension of his experiences, emotions, and thoughts to those environments. The works conceal as much as they reveal by intertwining gestural marks, textures, and fields of color that lure the viewer in, tempting one to get lost in thought and emotion. Often starting a painting by reducing an idea to its simplest forms of lines and marks, Tabing slowly develops the work, reacting spontaneously, almost reflexively, to what is happening on the canvas. This process, combined with deliberate, bold brushstrokes, creates uncomplicated yet powerful paintings. Being self-taught allows him to approach each painting with an uninhibited, purely authentic style that continues to evolve. While he enjoys talking about his art, the artist prefers to have the paintings do his talking, sharing feelings and emotions that he says he could never put into words. Born and raised in Kansas, USA, Lloyd Tabing lives and works in Jönköping, Sweden.   ",678

Bo Bartlett,"An American realist with a modernist vision, Bo Bartlett creates paintings that celebrate the underlying epic nature of the commonplace and the personal significance of the extraordinary. Inspired by the artists of American Realism, such as Norman Rockwell, Edward Hopper, and Andrew Wyeth, in his paintings, the artist combines landscape, figure painting, still life, and portraiture. Today his artworks are part of several public collections, including Denver Museum of Art, Greenville County Museum of Art in South Carolina, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and Seattle Art Museum.   Born in 1955 in Columbus, Georgia, Bartlett traveled around the world before moving to Seattle, Washington, in 2005. He studied at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and then the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. The artist received a Certificate of Fine Art from PAFA in 1980. He also received a Certificate in Filmmaking from New York University, and the influence of film is apparent in his work. Inspired by Surrealist masters such as Salvador Dali, Giorgio de Chirico, and Rene Magritte, Bartlett creates paintings with a dream-like quality, often depicting scenes from real life that seem highly improbable. He had numerous solo shows, including those at The Florence Academy of Art, Jersey City, Dowling Walsh Gallery, ME, Mennello Museum of American Art and Orlando Museum, FL, Ameringer McEnery Yohe, New York, NY, Morris Museum of Art, Augusta, GA, and Ilges Gallery, Columbus State University, Columbus, GA.   Creating multilayered imagery, Bartlett pushes the boundaries of the realist tradition. He depicts scenes set around his childhood home in Georgia, his island summer home in Maine, his home in Pennsylvania, or the surroundings of his studio and residence in Washington state, examining a deeper mythical concept of the archetypal, universal home. About his creative process, Bartlett said: In Bartlett’s work, there is often a darker undercurrent, like, for example, in painting Young Life. Inspired by Grant Wood’s American Gothic, the painting depicts a couple posing after a successful hunt, splattered with blood.   Bo Bartlett’s values, more than anything else, a complete authenticity that is possible to achieve only once control by established cultural mores, theology, and art is completely stripped away. Only then can one live in total freedom. What was once modern, original, and shocking in the future can become blasé, therefore the only true value in art is the original intent of the artist. It is the one true thing that is undeniable, timeless, and consistent. The artist’s fearlessness in the face of others' opinions and ideologies is able to transcend all styles themselves. Bo Bartlett currently lives and works between Wheaton Island, ME, and Columbus, GA.  ",688

Schnider's works are products of a spontaneous, intuitive process that includes meticulous planning, rigorous structuring, organizing and executing. His paintings take as their source the delicate explorations of shifting planes and geometric forms found in the artist’s drawings. His unique visual language oscillates between abstraction and figure, abundance and absence of meaning, closeness and distance. Overlapping these planes of color and negative space, the artist toys with our sense of perception. ",690
Adam Barker-Mill,"A British artist, Adam Barker-Mill examines the physical and experimental properties of light.

Marshall Goodman,"Prolific American painter Marshall Goodman (born 1916) is known for creating optimistic works devoid of puerile indignation or facile preachments. The sketches, drawings, lithographs, watercolors, oils, and engravings he made throughout his career clearly show he was a master colorist. The artist was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, and in 1940 graduated from Rhode Island School of Design. After receiving the Alumni Fellowship Prize from the school, he relocated to Mexico, where he collaborated with masters such as Leopoldo Mendez, Aguirre, Paul O'Higgins, and Zalce at the Taller Grafico Workshop. Even though he was working closely with members of Mexican schools, Goodman never fully embraced the style. Not feeling comfortable with the themes burdened with tragic elements or simply somber, the artist stayed true to his optimistic nature and created works filled with good cheer. There is a deep sense of honesty and simplicity in all his artworks. Marshall Goodman skillfully blended colors, accentuating their contrast in their deep chiaroscuro, which is perfectly balanced with his signature harmonious and unified compositions. The artist worked as a freelance illustrator of theatrical caricature for the branches of New York Times and New York Herald Tribune, the Pic Magazine, and This Week. Among his most notable works are the murals at the Officer's Club, commissioned by U.S. Naval Base in Bermuda in 1942. After he completed the artwork, Goodman remained on the island, enamored by the beauty of local colors. Throughout the 1960s, the artist painted numerous murals on the walls of malls all around the United States. In the 1990s, he worked as a courtroom sketch artist, covering some of the most notorious cases, including the World Trade Center Bombing in 1993 and the trial of John Gotti, Imelda Marcos (CNN).

Once finished, her pieces, shaped and minimal canvases designed to hang on a wall, occupy a space between traditional painting and sculpture. Blyton studied at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1988. Her works have been exhibited extensively around the world, with most recent shows in Paris, France, New York and Portland, the United States, and Kiev, Ukraine.

Francesca Borgo,"Francesca Borgo is an Italian contemporary abstract painter known for her landscapes, mainly inspired by her daily outdoor walks. She finds balance and freedom in retracing her steps, enjoying the lights, and diving into the smallest details of the scene. Her work revolves around ethereality, texture, and atmosphere, with her studio practice incorporating a range of different aesthetic positions and methods. Borgo rubs in paints, gesso, and resins mixed with sand, painstakingly building her pieces layer by layer and giving them texture. She likes to use both dense and diluted colors, preferably earthy natural tones, to shape nuanced and subtle effects, while she achieves light reflections with metallic pigments. Prone to experimenting and open to new techniques, she also uses new media – a pen, touch-tablet, and computer software – for image creation and manipulation, producing (mostly) unique digital prints. Francesca Borgo currently lives in Trieste and works in her studio at home.   Featured image: Francesca Borgo - Going North, 2019 (detail).

Benjamin Anderson,"Benjamin Anderson is an American artist known for his monumental oil paintings. He was educated in Florence, Italy, and the SF Academy of Art University (BFA). Recognized for his portraiture skills, he has recently been focused on water-related works. Figurative in their nature, Anderson’s paintings depict either people swimming or submerged objects, such as cars, planes, pistols, and bottles. He lives and works in Santa Barbara, California.

Tara Conley,"Tara Conley is an American sculptor known for creating organic yet original shapes from man-made materials while adding a sense of humor and wonder to the mix. Working with fiber, steel, bronze, and fiberglass, she often mixes materials and processes in surprising ways. Originally from Bath, New York, Conley studied at the Rochester Institute of Technology, School for American Crafts, where she earned her BFA in 1998. She lives and works in Houston, Texas.   ",703
Janin Walter,"Interested in the dynamics of space, both external and internal, Janin Walter is a German multidisciplinary artist known for her abstract paintings. This interest for spaces was developed during her Architecture studies at the Technical University of Berlin. After her graduation in 2004, she spent several years in the Netherlands and Switzerland, where she worked as an urban designer, using artistic methods to visualize spaces and designs. From 2007-2009, Walter also studied Space Strategies at the School of Art Weißensee. During her studies, she worked for established artists such as Jeppe Hein, Jorinde Voigt, and Olafur Eliasson. From 2010-2015, she was an assistant professor at the Department of Fine Arts / Institute of Architecture at TU Berlin. Her research into architecture informs her collages, which examine the structure of human interactions with the built world. However, Walter’s paintings, abstract and vivid, attempt to reveal internal and intuitive processes related to her relationship with rational space. Meditating before creating, she allows the work to flow from a relaxed and creative mental state, enabled by theta brain waves. Originating in feeling rather than analyses, her works are layered, organic compositions in which vibrant neon hues mix with brut gestures and forms amid atmospheric color fields. Janin Walter lives and works in Berlin.     ",704
Franko Tencic,"Franko Tencic (Franko Tenčić) is a Croatian contemporary artist who creates vibrant, layered abstract paintings in which biomorphic shapes, natural forms, and calligraphic marks seem to float within dreamlike, radiating worlds of color. Self-taught, he works in a range of mediums, including spray paint, acrylics, and graphite, constructing entangled, writhing compositions that swarm with primordial abundance. Tencic cites nature and its positive and creative power as his biggest influence. His entire oeuvre can be brought under the common denominator: “affirmation of the affirmative.” Although a bit paradoxical, it is about the affirmation of qualities and values that offer hope and belief and make essence and performance meaningful and purposeful. Born in Pula, Franko Tencic has exhibited his work extensively in Croatia, and his paintings are included in numerous private collections around the world.

Daria lived most of her life in London but returned to Russia in the 2000s, settling in Moscow.",706
Nathan Paddison,"Self-taught Australian artist Nathan Paddison creates raw, emotive paintings grounded in the traditions of Art Brut, Graffiti, and Abstract Expressionism. Drawing inspiration from his self-described troubled past, Paddison paints with urgency and physicality, layering dynamic, gestural brush marks and ecstatic forms atop his worn and rough textured surfaces. Scattered bits of text intermingle with hints of human bodies and natural forms, suggesting stories interrupted, places torn apart, or perhaps a crime scene recently abandoned. Embedded in the drama is a keen sense of humor, and a vivid grasp of the emotive power of color. Blending traditional fine art mediums such as acrylic paints and pastels with everyday materials such as newspaper and markers, Paddison achieves a fresh, energetic, and undeniably contemporary visual voice.

Danny Giesbers,"Danny Giesbers is a Dutch autodidact abstract painter who incorporates 21st century developments into his abstract paintings. His self-developed technique and process are partially algorithmic, and partially intuitive. While working with chance, Giesbers attempts to guide his works by the choice of materials and through execution of his meditative application of each layer. His emotional state and level of focus play an important part in the execution and its result.   Aesthetically, Giesbers strives to make his works appear futuristic, and digital, though they are fully analogue. His Shifts paintings evoke serenity, dissonance, harmony and change. For this series, Giesbers mobilizes phosphorescent paints to create luminescent fields of color that glow in the dark, causing a literal shift in perspective as conditions change. Rather than being objects of passive viewing, the Shift paintings take an active role to make a statement about transformation, and the interrelationships between forces and elements in the physical world. Giesbers refers to this work as Transformative Abstraction.     Featured image: Danny Giesbers - portrait. Photo courtesy IdeelArt",708

Tanc,"Tancrède Perrot aka Tanc is a French artist born in 1979 in Paris. His work is characterized by the uniqueness of his style, which is better understood acknowledging Tanc grew up as a graffiti artist. He sees street art as ephemeral, and that the creative process matters more than the result itself. To him, being an artist means embracing a certain way of life: to be fully committed, and show absolute integrity. At the turn of the century, he mainly focused on studio work. His exploration of the possibilities of the line allowed him to immediately stand out from the usual graffiti artists. His work strives towards synthesis of his name, of tags, of individuals, of music, of life. His work does not seek perfection, but spontaneity. The artist’s state defines the work’s density and its precision. His heart beat activates his arm like a metronome: the artist is not trying to control this flow, but rather understand the composition that suddenly appears on the canvas, perfect balance between consciousness and unconsciousness. He appends his signature on his canvasses as he used to do so on the walls with his graffiti since his teenage years. This discipline is above all an instinctive outlet for a need to express himself: he takes over the urban space and shouts his name across the city. But soon the letters disappear and Tanc starts exploring formal abstraction. By focusing his work on line and color, he regenerates the pictorial tradition by confronting it with street art's essential vitality: prevalence of action, perfection of the gesture, acceptance of the unexpected, and expression of a strong singularity.  Action, energy, and the artist’s emotion thus aim to touch the viewer in a sensual, intimate and immediate way. Tanc has exhibitions in France regularly, but his work has gained international prominence with exhibitions in Germany, in the UK, Morocco, or New York. Tancrede Perrot lives and works in Paris.",718
STATIC,"STATIC is the creative output of London-based image makers Tom Jackson and Craig Evans who have been producing limited editions and original works since 2006. They are a design collective that draw on their combined exposure to all forms of art and design, media influences, everyday life and social and environmental influences. Their work combines elements of street art and fine art, creating a clean graphic style through the talented application of stencils, spray paint, screen-printing and paint brushes.   Static is made up of two art school friends, Tom Jackson and Craig Evans. Following their meeting at art school, they went their separate ways and pursued degrees in Liverpool and Edinburgh. Reunited, they returned to the North East to form STATIC and open their first studio in 2006. They have been printing, painting and pasting all their work in-house to maintain a consistency of output and directly influence the decision making processes that go into each idea, original artwork and edition they produce.   The work of STATIC is recognizable for its blend of graphic and patterned imagery created through a combination of screen printing and mixed media techniques. STATIC’s work is constructed from found visual imagery as well as symbols and signifiers from modern culture which they continue to apply to a wide range of surfaces, including wood, metal, perspex and glass. The duo specialize in limited edition prints and originals, all of which are created by hand. A lot of their work goes through a process that involves image manipulation and creation on the computer and then it is either cut as a stencil by hand or made into a silk screen. STATIC find great inspiration in contemporary revolutionary actions at all levels of society, particularly riots and strikes. The Chinook Chandelier is one of STATIC’s most recognizable images to date. It was created in response to the Ministry of Defence’s £500 million purchase of 8 useless MK3 Chinook helicopters. “It’s not about being remembered, for us it’s about our work making an impact right now”, the duo states.  Work by Static can be found on the streets of London as well as exhibited in galleries across the UK, USA, Japan, and Australia. Since 2010, STATIC have been producing layered glass works which have been exhibited in the UK, Japan, Singapore, Italy, the US, India and Russia. In 2013, a selection of pieces from their Phantasms of the Living show was added to the private art collection of the Saudi Arabian Royal Family and in 2014 they were commissioned by Activision to create a unique Camo pattern for the release of the new Call Of Duty AW game launch. STATIC is currently based in London.",719
Gene Davis,"An American painter, Gene Davis was best known for painting lively compositions of thin, lively colored vertical stripes. He played a significant role in the color abstraction movement that first achieved prominence in the 1960s. His contribution was invaluable in establishing Washington, D.C., as a center of contemporary art. Davis was born in 1920 in Washington, DC, where he spent nearly all his life there. Before turning to painting in 1949, he  worked as a sportswriter, covering the Washington Football Team and other local teams. Although never formally trained, he educated himself through assiduous visits to New York’s museums and galleries as well as to Washington’s art institutions, especially the Phillips Collection. He was also much influenced by his friend Jacob Kainen, an artist and art curator. His first solo exhibition of drawings took place at the Dupont Theater Gallery in 1952, and his first exhibition of paintings was at Catholic University in 1953. Davis' early works are characterized by a distinct improvisational quality. In his later stripe paintings, which he is best known for, show the same preference for spontaneity when it comes to the selection of color. He often compared himself to a jazz musician who plays by ear, describing his approach to painting as ​""playing by eye.""",720
Barry Flanagan,"Barry Flanagan was a Welsh sculptor best known for his bronze statues of hares and other animals. From the outset his work has been perceived as radical and independent. Born in Prestatyn, North Wales, Flanagan studied architecture at Birmingham College of Art and Crafts and the received a Vocational Diploma in Sculpture at St. Martin's School of Art in London in 1964. Flanagan graduated in 1966 and taught at St. Martin's School of Art and the Central School of Arts and Crafts, between 1967 and 1971. In 1991 was elected to the Royal Academy and he received the OBE. He exhibited in a range of venues, including Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, Tate Britain, Waddington Galleries, London, New Art Centre, Roche Court, Salisbury, Wiltshire, Vero Beach Museum of Art, Vero Beach, Florida, Waddington Galleries, London and Paul Kasmin Gallery, New York. His is included in several public collections, such as The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Tate Gallery in London, the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst in Ghent, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Flanagan is known for his dynamic, often monumental, bronze hares, which spring into life. Fusing the everyday, the imaginary and fantastical, he moulded clay into animal forms, hares, elephants, dogs and horses. His idiosyncratic style employs an elongated stylization of form, similar to Alberto Giacometti.",721
Georges Rouault,"French artist Georges Rouault is best known for his works that mixed Expressionism and Fauvism with a bold color palette and bold lines. Inspired by French medieval artists and religious iconography, he created paintings, ceramics, prints, and stained glass. Today his works are part of several private and public collections, including the Tate Gallery in London, the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.   Georges Henri Rouault (born in 1871) got his first art education as a child studying the collection of Honoré Daumier's lithographs. One of his first jobs that most certainly influenced his artistic expression was working as an apprentice in a glazier's workshop. During his five years there, he took part in the restoration of medieval stained-glass windows of Chartres cathedral. In 1891 he studied under the renowned painter Gustave Moreau at the École des Beaux-Arts. There he got accounted and eventually became good friends with Albert Marquet and Henri Matisse. The artist's early works were academic in style, which can be best seen in the painting L'Enfant Jésus Parmi Les Docteurs, for which he won the Prix Chenavard. After the death of Moreau, Rouault went through an emotional and psychological crisis that took him four years to overcome. Under the influence of writers Leon Bloy and J. K. Huysmans, he became a firm believer that the purpose of art was personal expression. Also, the works by Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh in part, influenced his decision to join the Fauves (Wild Beasts).   Georges Rouault became a devoted Roman Catholic, yet at the same time, he was fascinated by the human condition. The frequent trips to the Paris law courts greatly influenced his style, as he began depicting the subjects that seemed to have fallen from the grace of God, such as clowns, prostitutes, peasants, workers, and judges. For a year, the artist attended the trials at the Tribunal de la Seine, which resulted in the series Les Tribunaux and such paintings as Les Juges and Le Tribunal de Province. Rouault depicted humanity without a mask displaying all its perceived flaws.   In 1910 the artist had his first solo gallery exhibition at the 1900 Centennial Exhibition of French art at the Druet Gallery. The beginning of World War I marked a change in style as he transitioned from using oil on paper to oil and canvas, which greatly helped him reach the desired effect of a stained glass window feel.   Georges Rouault passed away in 1958 at 87 and was the first artist to be given a state funeral by the French government. He has had numerous retrospectives organized by acclaimed international institutions, such as Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Palais des Beaux-Arts and Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris, Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Bologna, Cleveland Museum of Art, and The Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Dana Schutz,"The American artist Dana Schutz is best known for her humorous, gestural paintings that take on specific subjects or narrative situations as a point of departure. Characterized by a vibrant use of subject, form, and color, her canvases feature grotesque, comic figures in acts of creativity or violence. Born in 1976 in Livonia, Michigan, Schutz currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She received her BFA from the Cleveland Institute of Art and her MFA from Columbia University in 2002. Becoming an art star before 30, she is famous for her 2005 work The Presentation, a large-scale, James Ensor-like painting of spectators at a surgery that is in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)'s permanent collection. Her works are also in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, among others. Schutz's gestural, figurative paintings often take on specific subjects or narrative situations as a point of departure. Her fictive subjects ranged from people who can eat themselves, a gravity fanatic, imaginary births and deaths, public/private performers, awkward situations and mundane objects. She explained that her paintings ""respond to what I think is happening in the world.""",723
Peter Hujar,"Peter Hujar was a leading figure in the group of artists, musicians, writers, and performers at the forefront of the cultural scene in downtown New York in the 1970s and early 80s, and he was enormously admired for his completely uncompromising attitude towards work and life. He died of AIDS in 1987, leaving behind a complex and profound body of photographs. Born in 1934 in Trenton, New Jersey, Hujar was raised by his Ukrainian grandparents on their farm. After his grandmother died, he moved to New York City to live with his mother and her second husband. Due to abuse, he left home at the age of 16 to live independently. Receiving his first camera in 1947, he entered the School of Industrial Art with an interest to become a photographer. Early in 1967, he was one of a select group of young photographers in a master class taught by Richard Avedon and Marvin Israel, where he met Alexey Brodovitch and Diane Arbus. Today recognized as ""one of the major American photographers of the late twentieth century"" and ""among the greatest American photographers,"" Hujar created influential portraits of people, animals, and landscapes, characterized by their exquisite black-and-white tonalities. These were, in his own words, ""uncomplicated, direct photographs of complicated and difficult subjects,"" immortalizing moments, individuals, and subcultures.",724
Hans Bellmer,"German Surrealist artist, Hans Bellmer, is best known for his life-size sculptures of grotesque dolls and erotic photography. He was fascinated with pubescent female figures, which were metaphors of sexuality. Created out of metal and wood skeleton, padded with plaster curves and papier-mâché, often twisted, headless, deformed, with missing limbs. These dolls were pervasions of the female form. Hans Bellmer observed: Hans Bellmer’s artwork has been on display in numerous galleries and museums, including the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, the Whitechapel Gallery in London, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, NY, and the International Surrealist Exposition in Paris in 1947.   Hans Bellmer (1902) was born in Katowice, Poland, and studied engineering at the Berlin Technische Hochschule. There he came in contact with the artists of the Dada movement and George Grosz. With the rise of the Nazi regime, Bellmer stopped doing any work that supported the state. However, his strongest statements against fascism were made through art itself. His photo book, titled The Doll (Die Puppe) published anonymously in 1934, featured 10 photographs of Bellmer’s first doll. The disfigured figures were a complete opposite to the Nazi’s cult of the perfect human body, and soon they proclaimed him a degenerate. In 1938, Bellmer was forced to flee the country and move to Paris, where he was welcomed by Andre Breton and the Surrealists.   Bellmer’s art seemed to personify the Surrealist ideal of 2 opposites – aversion and attraction. The artist’s dolls, such as Games of the Doll (Jeux de la Poupée, 1935), often appear mangled, with twisted abdomens and parts missing. These artworks were both naturalistic and fantastical, evoking an array of emotions. Throughout his career, Bellmer was fascinated with the burning point (brennpunkt) – where the outer meets the inner.  His sculptures, drawings, and photographs were inspired by lust, sexuality, subconscious, dreams, and death. The feminist movement was strongly opposed to Bellmer's work, however, several female artists who knew him claimed he treated women with respect. Bellmer had his first solo exhibition at the Librairie Trentin in Toulouse, France, in 1943. He worked in close collaboration with his wife, artist Unica Zürn, until her death in 1970.   Hans Bellmer is one of the most influential artists of the 20th century that inspired generations of young artists. His work has been an inspiration for numerous artworks and media, such as Louise Bourgeois' Fillette (1968), Cindy Sherman's Untitled #263 (1991). The Riot Girls movement of the 90s used Bellmer's imagery, most notably, Courtney Love used it for her ""Kinderwhore"" aesthetic. Even popular anime films and video games, such as Silent Hill 2, feature characters inspired by his artwork. Hans Bellmer died in 1975 in Paris, France. Today his work is part of numerous collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, and the Art Institute of Chicago. ",725
Ben Sack,"Benjamin Ben Sack is an American artist, known for his pen and ink drawings of imaginary, complex cityscapes. He went to Virginia Commonwealth University and earned his BFA in 2011, magna cum laude.  Sack uses architecture as a medium that can express the unique space between realism and abstraction. From gothic cathedrals to skyscrapers, his cities are the product of his imagination. His dense, detailed urban landscapes, comprising buildings, roads, rivers and bridges span centuries. This large-scale cities take months to be completed.   The artist derives his inspiration from the architecture, history, classical music, literature and geography. In 2014, he was in residency aboard MS Amsterdam, the ship which circumnavigated the globe for a few months and provided Sack with inspiration for his works. Apart from solo exhibitions, Sack exhibited his work in many group exhibitions, mostly in New York and Miami. His largest artwork, Chronoglyph, was on view in Robert Fontaine Gallery in Miami at CONTEXT Art Miami in 2014.  Ben Sack was the graphics winner in the International Arts Festival in 2012, and received the Department of Communication Arts Outstanding Senior Award in 2011.

Yasmin Alt,"Yasmin Alt is a German contemporary artist known for her works that take the form of playful yet striking objects inspired by industrial, medieval and antique architecture. Her sculptures are reduced architectural models presented apart from their original contexts; the artist makes them stand alone, or places them in unfamiliar combinations with each other.   In the past several years, she began creating collage works, using her own photographs of landscapes as the starting point. Alt’s collages follow her recognizable minimalistic, geometric style as they emerge from her paintings and sculptural works as if they’re their integral parts. As a result of her discovery of collage, she started treating her objects in a similar way, alternating constructional and destructive actions.   Born in Bad Schwalbach, a town northwest of Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1978, she earned her Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Southern California in LA. Although she was interested in art and architecture since an early age, it was during her studies that she decided to devote her time to art. She moved back to her native country to enroll the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden, where she earned a BA in 2008 and a MA in 2010.   She has participated in many exhibitions at galleries throughout Germany and beyond like Rockelmann&, Berlin; Kunsthaus Dresden, Dresden; Emmanuel Post contemporary art, Berlin; Gallery of the Art Academy, Dresden; Galeri Nasional, Jakarta, Indonesia; Galerie Zanderkasten, Dresden, to name a few.

Herbert Bayer,"Famous for being a designer, painter, typographer, and an architect, Herbert Bayer was one of Bauhaus’ last students. And one of the most creative individuals that every walked the face of Earth. In the time he had spent at the school, first as a student, a later as a teacher, he created the amount of work many struggle to produce in their entire lifetimes. After the rise of the Nazi Germany, like many of his contemporaries, Bayer left the country and went to the United States, where he continued to work. Besides his own pieces, his legacy includes the Atlantic Richfield Company’s art collection, which was, at the time, the world's largest corporate art collection.[1]  He was born in Haag, Austria. At the age of nineteen, Bayer became an apprentice to the architect and designer Georg Schmidthamer in Linz, where he first started working as a typographer. In 1921, he went to Darmstadt and worked as assistant to the architect Josef Emmanuel Margold.[2] While he was there, Bayer discovered Gropius’ Bauhaus Manifesto and was very intrigued by it. The same year he enrolled at the Weimar Bauhaus, where he had the pleasure and privilege of studying under such masters as Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee.[3] Four years later, Bayer completed his studies at the Bauhaus, and decided to stay on as  one of its most prominent faculty members, and as a head of printing and advertising department, appointed by Walter Gropius. Adopting the principles of reductive minimalism, Bayer developed a Sans-serif type called Universal, which helped in defining the Bauhaus aesthetic.[4] In 1928, the artist moved to Berlin and established a successful graphic design firm. He even worked as the art director of German Vogue. However, he was feeling increasingly uncomfortable due to the rise of the Nazi party and their oppressing government. Yet, he stayed in the country far longer than some of his fellow artists. In 1936, he designed the brochure for the Deutschland Ausstellung, which was an exhibition meant for the tourists in Berlin during the Olympic Games. His works were also included in the Nazi-organized Degenerate Art exhibition in 1937, and that was the straw that broke the camel's back, forcing him to finally leave Germany.   Upon leaving Germany, Bayer spent some time traveling Italy before settling in New York in 1938, where he organized the exhibition Bauhaus 1919-1928 at the New York Museum of Modern Art in the same year. Without any political or ideological restrictions, his career bloomed. Aside from distinctive advertising jobs, he became a consultant art director for J. Walter Thompson and art director of Dorland International, after which he developed a long-lasting association with the Container Corporation of America, producing some of the most innovative and widely applauded print ads of the time. [5] Hired by a visionary and industrialist Walter Paepcke, Bayer moved to Colorado in 1946 to work, among others, on the promotion of skiing. His promotional posters helped the viewers in identifying skiing with exciting and glamorous times, turning Aspen into one of the most popular destinations for skiers. Continuing his typography, Bayer designed his phonetic alphabet for English in 1959. A sans-serif without capital letters, it had special symbols for the endings -ed, -ory, -ing, and -ion, as well as the digraphs ""ch"", ""sh"", and ""ng"". He also co-designed the Aspen Institute and restored the Wheeler Opera House. The artist met an oilman and businessman Robert O. Anderson when the latter noticed Bayer’s modern house of his own design and went over to introduce himself. It was the beginning of a lifetime friendship and business association that resulted in the world’s greatest art collection at the time. Anderson formed Atlantic Richfield Company, and Bayer created the company’s logo and all of the related corporate branding. He was in charge of overseeing acquisitions for ARCO Plaza, the new headquarters, and he designed Double Ascension, a sculpture-fountain placed between the dark green granite towers.     Herbert Bayer will be remembered as one of the most creative individuals, whose works in various fields were widely recognized and famous. He designed fonts, buildings, posters. While he was at the Bauhaus, he produced more than some artists create in their lifetimes. He was only 28 years old! And yet, his creative energy and inspiration “forced” him to continue making pieces, and all of them were quite distinctive and innovative. ARCO’s art collection, which was at one point the world’s largest, is also one his accomplishments.   He is represented by Kunzt Gallery.  Sources:  ",728

Guillaume Azoulay,"It is unbelievable how much power can be in a single line. For some masters, like Guillaume Azoulay certainly is, it has shaped their careers. His style is so unique, it’s instantly paired with his name. The variety of approaches he conceives makes his journey distinctive and adventurous. He doesn’t express himself as filled in outline, but rather, he achieves the subject form, the musculature, all the facial expressions, the eyes and the nose, through the subtle changes in the curvature of the line. Often referred to as the King of the line, Azoulay’s approach to it is an organic one, embodying enduringly appealing qualities such as harmony, balance, and contrast.   If we attempt to summarize Azoulay’s artistic philosophy by using just one reference, it would be, without a doubt, his determination to show all of the expressive uses to which a seemingly simple design element as the line can be put. For that specific reason, but also for his mastery of the technique, he is quite often called the King of the line, a hard-earned title that speaks for itself. In his work, the artist has amassed an impressive catalog of stunning full-color serigraphs. As razor-thin ribbons of black ink arc and swirl around Azoulay’s flights of fancy, they are offset by electric hues of vivid color creating a kind of optical illusion: the areas of shadow and light are formed by those exquisite lines, while the intensity of color remains constant as one shade blends into another. Praised for his ability to utilize the purity of line, Azoulay creates powerful illusions of sculptural volumes in motion.   Born in Casablanca, Morocco in 1949, Azoulay moved to Paris with his parents a decade later. By the age of thirteen, he was sketching and selling his drawings on the streets. In 1967, he settled in Israel where he applied to Betzalel, one of the Middle East’s most famous art academies. Rejected but not deterred, he continued his studies, graduating as an actor. For some time he was active in the theater and movies, but facing the impossible task of equally sharing his time between his two passions, Azoulay decided to pursue a career in art. The international recognition came in 1978 when two of his works were accepted into the permanent collection of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The artist finally settled in California in March of 1976, where he lives with his wife Charmaine Seal, who’s a noted ballerina, but also one his most favorite subjects in his work.  ",730
Leslie Hewitt,"A contemporary visual artist, Leslie Hewitt explores political, social and personal narratives through photography, sculpture and site-specific installations. Revisiting the still life genre from a post-minimalist perspective, she creates spare assemblages of ordinary effects and materials that explore fluid notions of time. Born in 1977 in Saint Albans, New York, Hewitt currently lives and works in New York. She received a B.F.A. from the Cooper Union's School of Art in 2000 and an M.F.A. from Yale University in 2004. She studied Africana Studies and Cultural Studies at New York University from 2001 to 2003. She has held residencies at the Core Program at The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, The Studio Museum in Harlem, and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. Using snapshots, ephemera, and the residue of mass culture, Hewitt creates still-life tableaux and installations that reconsider the role history plays in our collective consciousness as well as the mechanisms behind the construction of meaning and memory. She often uses personal mementos such as family pictures, stacking them on top of books and vintage magazines that reference the black literary and popular-culture ephemera. These arrangements both evoke and unsettle traditions of 17th-century Dutch still-life paintings. By Inserting people, things and icons forgotten by the times, she gives them new purpose in the present.

Jimmy Ernst,"Jimmy Ernst, the son of famous German Surrealist artist Max Ernst, became known for his distinct style influenced by jazz and Native American culture. Born in 1920 in Cologne, Germany, Ernst remained living with his mother Luise Straus after the divorce. After visiting his father in France in 1930, he met many artists such as Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dalí, Alberto Giacometti, André Masson, Joan Miró, Man Ray and Yves Tanguy, as well as his father's lover Leonora Carrington. He studied printing and typography before immigrating to the United States in 1938 to escape the Nazis. Ernst became director of The Art of This Century Gallery in 1942. A year later he had his first one-person exhibition. In 1943, he opened Norlyst Gallery with Eleanor Lust, which also hosted three solo shows by Ernst. Ernst's early canvases were tinged with Surrealism, while his first solo show featured organic abstractions. Inspired by jazz, he used discrete color areas to approximate syncopation and rhythm. During the 1950s, he began experimenting with line, which determined his future directions. His mature works feature complex inter-locking webs of lines that formed architectonic structures. Always abstract, his later paintings evoke the spatial quality of panoramic cityscapes. ",732

Alfredo Volpi,"Alfredo Volpi was a prominent painter and a representative of the artistic and cultural Brazilian modernist movement. He synthesized fine art and popular art, figuration and abstraction and European tradition and Brazilian modernism. Born in Lucca, Italy in 1896, Volpi moved with his parents to São Paulo, Brazil at the age of two, where he became a Brazilian citizen, and lived for the majority of his life. A self-taught painter, he produced his first naturalist painting in 1914 at the age of twelve. Though his initial work shows he managed to absorb the influence of both Impressionism and Expressionism, he soon shifted to a most peculiar style, using geometric abstract forms and switching from oil paint to tempera. In the 1930s, he became part of a collective called the Grupo Santa Helena, a set of São Paulo-based artists loosely united by imagery with proletarian themes. Volpi's first one-man exhibition was held at the Itá Gallery in São Paulo in 1944. He rose to prominence after his participation at the second São Paulo Art Biennial, winning the Grand Prix for Brazilian painting, an award he shared with Di Cavalcanti. Soon he became known as one of the most important 20th century painters in Brazil. Volpi's practice was shaped by a fascination for the Italian early Renaissance, for Matisse, Morandi and the sphere of popular culture. His early oil paintings in the '40s were mostly landscapes and cityscapes, while in the '50s, '60s and '70s, the same subjects metamorphosed into colorful geometric compositions, oneiric archetypes of the façades of buildings and festive banners, and a humble and poetic ""algorithm"".

Cecily Brown,"Are figurative and abstract mutually exclusive? Does the existence of one means the demise of other? Cecily Brown certainly doesn’t think so. As one of the Britain’s (and world’s) leading painters, she has placed her work somewhere between the two extremes. Embracing both representational and abstract elements, her depictions of figures and nudes are quite sensual. She’s freeing her subjects from their original context, positioning them within new aesthetical reality. Her personal vision transcends classical notions of genre and narrative. Observing the world through women’s eyes and utilizing the no-man’s-land land between figuration with abstraction, Brown is creating an oeuvre that’s unique and easily recognizable.   She grew up in Surrey before moving to London suburb of Upper Norwood with her mother, the novelist Sheena Mackay, her two sisters and Robin Brown who, as she discovered when she was 21, was not her father. Instead, it was David Sylvester, a man some believe to have been England’s greatest art writer since Ruskin. This piece of a puzzle offers an existential clue about Brown’s identity and her aspirations towards painting.[1] She lost interest in regular school fairly early – by 16, she had already dropped out and went to Epson Art School, already sure she wanted to be a painter.[2] She earned a B-TEC Diploma in Art and Design in 1987, and in the next couple of years, attended Drawing and Printmaking classes at Morley College in London. In 1989, she began her studies at Slade School of Art, where she earned her BA in Fine Art in 1993. One year prior to graduation, Brown went to New York on a student exchange, immediately comprehending the difference between two cities. Energy, street life, human scale, the grid – everything was on a completely different level. Upon completing studies, she made a decision to move to New York. The fact that she didn’t feet in England only sped up the process: “What I hated about the Young British Artists was that it was a closed club, it made me feel a could never be a part of this…”[3] By the time Brown joined the Gagosian Gallery, one of the world’s most eminent gallery owners, she was thoroughly embedded in the Big Apple’s art scene.   She met a lot of emerging artists around that time – there were John Currin, Rachel Feinstein, George Condo, Elizabeth Peyton, Peter Doig, Chris Ofili, and many others. Speaking of her style, it can be compared to that of American Abstract Expressionists Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. Simultaneously, it can also be compared with Francis Bacon and his figurative paintings, in which bodies are often seen in tense relationships. Her range of interests and variety of influences includes Hieronymus Bosch, Chinese eroticism, Aubrey Beardsley and El Greco. It bothers her when her work gets described as purely abstract because she actually never lets go of figuration. There’s always a figurative thought in her head as she creates. “I take all my cues from the paint, so it’s a settle back and forth between my will and the painting directing what to do next.”[4] During the painting, things naturally break down and become more abstract. When that occurs, she definitely feels she wants to bring the figure back. Striving for something that’s not between figuration and abstraction, she wants her paintings to be both. In fact, “I often avoid using the terms figuration and abstraction because I've always tried to have it both ways.”[5] At an earlier stage in her career, Brown used photographs as sources, now she looks up the other art. In 2016, she’s been working a lot faster than before, completing her paintings in a matter of days, as opposed to months. These fast-produced pieces are her favorites, as they seem really fresh.[6]   Cecily Brown made a real fuss in New York. Critiques praised her for reviving the Abstract Expressionism, but enriching it with a female perspective, distancing from a fierce masculinity. Her work was called groundbreaking, fighting both traditions and gendered assumptions. However, some critiques were not so enthusiastic. In 2000, Roberta Smith, a fierce critic of the New York Times, said: “…the lackluster nature of Ms. Brown's third New York show in three years, suggests that her career is ahead of her artistic development. With these eight large, seemingly abstract paintings, which feature dense generically gestural brushwork mostly in shades of pink and beige, she comes across as a diligent, ambitious young painter who has a lot to learn.”[7] This particular opinion, but also some other negative criticism she had received, did not help her self-esteem. She could only continue working, trying to express herself, to learn and evolve. And fifteen years later, Roberta Smith, the very same critic that once gave Cecily Brown the worst review of her life, once again wrote about her. This time, it was about the artist’s show of small garden painting at the West Village gallery of Michele Maccarone, and Smith named it one of the best shows of 2015.  References:  ",736
Robert Morris,"Robert Morris was an American sculptor, conceptual artist and writer. He was one of the most prominent theorists of Minimalism and also made important contributions to the development of performance, minimalism, land, the Process and installation art. He was born in Kansas City, Missouri and turned to art and art criticism after studying engineering, eventually writing a 1966 master’s thesis on Constantin Brancusi at Hunter College, New York. Initially a painter, Morris’ work of the 1950s was influenced by Abstract Expressionism and particularly Jackson Pollock. While living in California, Morris also came into contact with the work of La Monte Young and John Cage. The idea that art making was a record of a performance by the artist (drawn from Hans Namuth’s photos of Pollock at work) in the studio, led to an interest in dance and choreography. Morris’s early sculpture tended to emphasize a banal repertoire of form and subject-matter, while attempting to investigate the role of language in artistic representation. Through an influential series of articles that began to appear, irregularly, in the New York art press c. 1966, Morris assumed a highly visible position in determining both the objectives and the tenor of Minimalism in America, then in its early stages. During the 1960s and 1970s, Morris played a central role in defining three principal artistic movements of the period: Minimalist sculpture, Process Art, and Earthworks. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the rigid plywood and steel of Morris’s Minimalist works gave way to the soft materials of his experiments with Process Art. Subsequent projects Morris made during the late 1960s and early 1970s include indoor installations of such unorthodox materials as dirt and thread waste, which resisted deliberate shaping into predetermined forms, and monumental outdoor Earthworks. In the late 1960s, Morris began introducing indeterminacy and temporality into the artistic process, referred to as Process art or Anti-Form. By cutting, dropping, or stacking everyday materials such as felt or rags, Morris emphasized the ephemeral nature of the artwork, which would ultimately change every time it was installed in a new space. This replaced what Morris posited as the fixed, static nature of Minimalist, or ""object-type,"" art. When a collector, the architect Philip Johnson, did not pay Morris for a work he had ostensibly purchased, the artist drew up a certificate of de-authorization that officially withdrew all aesthetic content from his piece, making it nonexistent as art. Morris died on November 28th, 2018.",737
Arnulf Rainer,"An Austrian painter, Arnulf Rainer is the founder of Art Informel in Austria. He is best known for his 'overpaintings', developed in the 1950s. Born in 1929 in Baden, Austria, Rainer currently lives and works in Vienna. He attended the National Political Institute of Education in Traiskirchen, Lower Austria. During his studies, his paintings were inspired by aerial photography and cartographic landscapes with bomb craters, fires, tanks and aircraft. When his teacher tried to force him to draw from nature, he left the school in 1944 to become an artist. In this period, he was greatly influenced by Surrealism’s revolutionary theories. In 1950, he founded the Hundsgruppe (dog group) together with Ernst Fuchs, Arik Brauer, and Josef Mikl. In 1978, he received the Grand Austrian State Prize. In the same year, and in 1980, he became the Austrian representative at the Venice Biennale. Almost entirely self-taught, Rainer merged an interest in Surrealism with the physicality and spontaneity of Art Informel in his early paintings. Over the years he moved towards abstraction and more experimental practices. His practice was characterized by overpainting and reworking, painting over paintings by other artists or photographs of figures or nature, often building up heavy impasto.",738
Candida Hofer,"A renowned German photographer, Candida Höfer is best known for her large-format images of empty architectural interiors that explore the psychological environment of social and cultural institutions. Known for technical perfection and a strictly conceptual approach, these works examine how public spaces are designed to accommodate and inform the public. Höfer was born in 1944 in Cologne, where she still lives and works. After completing studies at the Cologne Werkschule, she enrolled in the Düsseldorf School of Art, where she studied under Bernd and Hilla Becher who influenced her approach to photography greatly. She rose to prominence in the 1980s. Her internationally recognized work has been shown in a range of institutions, including the Kunsthalle in Basel and in Berne, the Museum Folkwang in Essen, the Louvre in Paris, the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin and the Kunstmuseum Luzerne, Switzerland. She represented Germany at the 2003 Venice Biennale. Höfer photographer a range of places rooted in cultural formation and preservation, such as museums, libraries, universities, theaters, civic centers, and historic sites. These meticulously composed color images are devoid of people, yet they allow the viewer to consider the role of their missing inhabitants. Executed in large scale, these works allow for the contemplation of every single detail in the space.",739
Jeremy Annear,"Jeremy Annear is a British artist who belongs to a late generation of Modern British artists, best known for his abstract paintings.  Jeremy Annear was born in Exeter, England in 1949. He characterizes himself as a European Modernist. At a young age, while developing his artistic style, he was exposed to St Ives Abstraction, so his art is heavily influenced by it, particularly that of Peter Lanyon, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and others. In his work, the “traces” of the 20th-century European Art are also visible, as Annear also took after famous artists such as Pablo Picasso, George Braque and Joan Miró. As he worked in Germany and Australia, both of these cultures have influenced him as well. In 1966, he enrolled in Exeter College of Art, majoring in Painting and Printmaking three years later, after which he received his Bachelor of Education from Rolle College in Devon, England in 1976. He was a lecturer at South Devon College from 1982 until 1984.  Three years later, Jeremy Annear moved to Cornwall, Lizard Peninsula, wanting to dedicate himself to painting completely. During the time he spent there, Annear became a member of the Penwith Society of Artists in 1988, and Newlyn Society of Art in 1989 (four years later he was elected a member of committee). Having been awarded a DAAD stipendium in 1991, he moved to Germany, where he has created and exhibited extensively. Germans particularly liked his unique style, which is why Germany possesses the second largest collection of his artwork (after the UK). In 1993, he went to Sydney, Australia, where he stayed for a longer period of time. There he got in contact with the Aboriginal culture, which affected his work. He then returned to the UK, where lives to this day, with his wife Judy Buxton, who is also a painter.  Annear uses a number of media – almost anything that comes to hand, as he says – but he focuses primarily on oil on board and canvas. The distinctive style of layering paint yields art pieces with textural surfaces, resembling reliefs. “I have always wanted to throw lots of paint onto my supports,” he says. “Part of the deepest satisfaction of painting for me has been to achieve exactly what I want with the paint.” Annear manages to see a certain similarity among languages used to describe music, poetry, and painting. This “linguistic likeness” can as well be seen in many of his artwork titles, and just like Kandinsky for example, he is interested in synchronicity of music and the visual arts. Annear has exhibited mostly in the UK, but his works were also popular in Germany, France and the Netherlands. He is represented by Messums Gallery in London, Campden Gallery in Gloucestershire, and as of March 2015, by IdeelArt Gallery.  Here you can read an interview with Jeremy Annear by IdeelArt.",740

Francesco Scavullo,"American fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo is best known for celebrity portraits and work on the covers of magazines. One of his best works were the controversial photo of nude Burt Reynolds and later young Brooke Shields. Scavullo showed from a young age a great appreciation for women's beauty. Scavullo said: Today the artist's works are part of numerous private and public collections, including the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, Currier Museum of Art in Manchester and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.   Francesco Scavullo, born in 1921 on Staten Island, began taking photographs at an early age. In his first attempts, he employed the help of his sisters and friends. The preparation part was essential to him even then. He would spend quite some time arranging their hair makeup and choosing a wardrobe until they resembled his idea of movie stars. Unfortunately, he did not have the support of his father, who wished him to go into restaurant and hotel management. The summer job he arranged for him at the Colony Restaurant turned out to be a distaste, and young Scavullo soon quit. Scavullo's career truly began when he started working for a studio that produced fashion catalogues. After a chance introduction to a Vogue editor, he was hired at Vogue for a trial period. There he was assistant to Horst P. Horst, who took him under his wing not only as a mentor but friend as well. In 1948 he took a winning photo that ended up on the cover of the Seventeen and earned him a contract with the magazine.   Scavullo started working for Harper's Bazaar in 1955 and a decade later for Cosmopolitan. For over 30 years, the photographer took photos of the biggest stars while working for the magazine. From Sting in a pose of Jesus Christ to the famous photo of Janis Joplin with a cigarette and young model Gia Carangi. Among the amazing images are the nude shot of young Brooke Shields, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand taken for the movie A Star is Born. Scavullo also created cover albums, including the Donna Summer for her Once Upon A Time and Live and More, album The Wild Boys by Duran Duran, Dynasty album by band Kiss.   In the pursuit of the perfect shot, Francesco Scavullo invented a new lighting technique that helped glamorize his subjects. He was the first to use the light umbrellas that diffused the harsh quality of direct light. The results on location were the same as the conventional method of stringing muslin sheets on poles. Also, he would use pieces of cardboard to frame the models' faces and thus highlight them. Later in life, Scavullo was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which he claimed helped him focus and be inventive in many ways. He died in 2004 in New York at age 82.

Esteban Vicente,"A Spanish-American abstract artist, Esteban Vicente Pérez was best known for his vivid Abstract Expressionist paintings and collages, composed with jagged geometric shapes that seem to hover on the surface of his canvases. Focusing on exploring color and tonal harmonies, he created gestural and contemplative compositions. Born in 1903 in Turégano, Spain, Pérez developed interest in art at an early age and first began to draw at the age of 16. Since he was four years old, his father, and art enthusiast, would take him almost every Sunday to the Museo del Prado. He graduated from the Real Academia de Bellas Artes in Madrid in 1924. He had his first one-man exhibition in Madrid in 1928, after which he moved to Paris where he met, among others, Picasso, Dufy and Max Ernst. The artist immigrated to New York in 1936 to escape the Spanish Civil War, where he became associated with the New York’s abstract expressionists, working alongside artists such as Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, and Willem de Kooning. Pérez's paintings and collages are characterized by the use of vivid color and organic shapes, appearing to pulsate with light. His mature works exhibited the structural rigor and deliberate lack of emphasis, featuring vibrant chromatic harmonies on top of vaguely geometric structures.",743

Henry Moore,"Most prominent British artist Henry Moore is renowned for creating monumental and figurative sculptures of people and animals. Besides sculptures, he also created drawings depicting the life during air raids that Londoners often lived through in Second World War. Influenced by pre-Columbian and African art as well as works by Alberto Giacometti, Moore created modernist sculptures from marble, stone, and bronze. He is instrumental in bringing modernism to the British art scene and showing the public the unmeasurable raw power of primitive art. Today, thanks to the Henry Moore Foundation, a large number of his artworks are housed in the artist’s home in Perry Green in Hertfordshire.     Henry Moore was born in Castleford, England, in 1898 in a coal mining town. His father, a miner himself, worked hard so his children would never have to work there. However, when Moore expressed interest in the arts, specifically sculpture, his parents did not support him, for it sounded like a laborer profession without any monetary advantage. After a brief career as a school teacher, he fought in World War One but was soon wounded and returned home. Moore graduated from Leeds School of Art in 1919 and received a grant for the Royal College of Art in London, where he met fellow sculptor Barbara Hepworth.  Moore traveled all over Europe, broadening his horizons and befriending several Avant-garde artists such as Alberto Giacometti and Georges Braque. After a retrospective of his work in 1946 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, he gained global recognition. Next, he received the International sculpture prize at the Venice Biennale in 1948.    Moore's sculptures often possess an undefined biomorphic shape that draws the eye. The shapes are twisting and turning around the hollow space in the middle. His early works were done in a technique of direct carving, where there is no preparation, and the surface is not perfectly smooth. This technique was not received favorably by his peers, however, it allowed him to spontaneously reveal the shape. Between figuration and abstract, Moore created a series of family-group sculptures, including the famous Madonna and Child. However, he is best known for reclining figures that today adorn several public places around the world.  Besides working as a sculpture, Moore also expressed an interest in drawing, producing a large number of prints, etchings, lithographs, and drawings. Inspired by mythology and poetry, he created several series such as Elephant Skull Album and Sheep Albums.     Today, Henry Moore’s artworks are part of numerous collections, including the Hammer Museum, Tate, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Art Gallery of Ontario that has the largest number of pieces. In the ’70s, together with his daughter, he founded the Henry Moore Foundation to support young and emerging artists. Even though his artworks were sold for millions, Moore did not live as a rich man, choosing instead to donate large portions to the Foundation. Henry Moore passed away in 1986 at his home in Perry Green, UK.  Feature image: Henry Moore - photo by Allan Warren.    ",746
Sandra Chevrier,"Sandra Chevrier is a Canadian contemporary artist, known for her captivating collaged portraits of women from The Cages series. Born in 1983, Chevrier got her Bachelor’s degree in visual and media arts from UQAM - The Université du Québec à Montréal. As a self-taught artist, Sandra Chevrier first fell in love with art as a kid, expressing her emotions through pencil drawing. At first, she draw sketches of eyes, all the time. This initial passion is highly visible in her present work. Sandra likes to describe herself as a “gaze collector”, as she considers that you can read all the emotions of a human being just by looking in their eyes.   Chevrier can recall a precise moment that made her realize that she wanted to become an artist – as a teenager, she visited one gallery in Montreal, where she saw a painting that had a strong impact on her. The painting was Detritus Of Devotion, made by a Canadian artist Heidi Taillefer. As Sandra felt a powerful rush of emotions, she realized that she desired to be able to make people feel the same while looking at some of her own creations.   Works from Sandra Chevrier’s The Cages series are created with a strong message of social freedom and an open mind imbued into the canvas. The series emerged from the fuse of painting and collage, as Chevrier uses paint and actual comic book cuttings to produce intense mixed-media portraits of women. Sandra used to work in a really controlled and hyper realistic way before the discovery of collage and mixed media. Now, Chevrier’s work is an amalgam of fine and street art that is self-governed as well as supremely crafted. The Cages series tells a story of women trying to find freedom from the imposed cages of society’s distorted prejudices and expectations of what a woman should or shouldn’t be, of false beauty and perfection. With sharp colors and graphic lines, the artist uses loose and heavy textures of paint which make her portrayed subjects seem to be emerging from the surreal world within the canvas, revealing the underlying tragedy of oppressed female identity. By using comics as a mask for her portrayed heroines, Chevrier highlights the fragility of the superhero, their personal weaknesses and flaws, and exposes the humanity within the superhuman.  Sandra Chevrier participated in Nuart Festival in 2015, as a chosen artist to kick off Art Billboard project, a new project whose main idea is to give contemporary artists the chance to work outside their comfort zone, on the scale of street art in the public sphere. Sandra Chevrier exhibited her work mostly in Canada, but in San Francisco and Los Angeles, United Kingdom, throughout Europe and Asia as well. The most successful series up to date – Super heroes Cages, obtains a worldwide success. Her artworks are now in the collections of art collectors all over the world – Europe, USA, Netherlands, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Russia, and a lot more. Sandra Chevrier is represented by C.O.A. Galerie located in Montreal, and Ministry of Walls online gallery. Sandra Chevrier currently lives in Montreal, Quebec, where she works in a home studio.

Ilya Bolotowsky,"Ilya Bolotowsky was an American artist of Russian birth who achieved success as a painter, sculptor, muralist, teacher, and filmmaker. His work, a search for philosophical order through visual expression, embraced cubism and geometric abstraction and was much influenced by Dutch painter Piet Mondrian.",748
Matthew Barney,"Known for diverse themes and innovative aesthetic vocabulary, Matthew Barney is an American contemporary sculptor, photographer, draughtsman, and one of the most talented video artists working today. When he came onto the scene in 1991, with his surreal sculptures and videos, he was a phenomenon, reaching instant success. Since then, his work has only got better and stranger. One of the most important American artists of his generation, Barney is internationally famous as a producer of films and videos. He and his crew also make sculptures and objects for the films and turn out photographs, books, and installations derived from the film projects. He doesn't regard any of his works - the sculptures, the photographs, the books, the films - as subsidiary to any others. To him, they're all expressions in different forms of the same ideas.[1]  Barney was born in San Francisco. When he was 6, his father Robert got a job running the food services at Boise State University and the family moved to Idaho. When Barney was 12, his parents divorced and his mother Marsha Gibney, an abstract painter, moved to New York. Barney and his older sister Tracy remained with his father in Boise, but he frequently visited his mother in New York, where he was exposed to contemporary art. In high school, he played on the wrestling and football teams. The summer after graduation, Barney answered an ad for a modeling job. He was spotted by a model scout and paid his way through college working for the Click modeling agency (clients included Ralph Lauren and J. Crew). Modeling meant that he had to abandon football, but he frequently references athletics in his artwork. Barney left Boise to attended college at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He entered as a premed student, thinking he would go into plastic surgery. However, after two semesters, he switched from premed to the art department. Barney’s dedication and originality were recognized by other students at Yale, who convinced the school to allow Barney to participate in the program of its highly-regarded graduate School of Art while still an undergraduate. After graduating from Yale in 1989, he moved to New York. His first studio was in Brooklyn, but he quickly moved into a studio on Leroy street that he shared with Michael Rees, a sculptor he had met at Yale.   Arguably, Barney’s best-known work is the Cremaster Cycle.[2] It’s a series of five films with a total running time of just under seven hours. Biologically, the cremaster is a muscle that raises and lowers the testicles, and Barney used the descent of the cremaster muscle as a symbol for the onset of male gender (which appears about nine weeks after a fetus is conceived). The five films progress from a state of undifferentiated gender - a fully ascended cremaster muscle, represented by the floating Goodyear Blimps and other symbols; through the organism’s struggle to resist gender definition, to the inevitable point where maleness can no longer be denied - the complete descent of the cremaster and release of the testicles. Over eight years, the artist looked beyond biology as a yaw to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as biography, mythology, and geology.  Barney directed all five films and appears as an actor in all but Cremaster 1. The films were shot and released out of order; he first filmed Cremaster 4 (1994), then Cremaster 1 (1995), Cremaster 5 (1997), Cremaster 2 (1999), and finally ended in the middle with Cremaster 3 (2002). The films frequently reference one another, but each film follows a different set of characters (although Gary Gilmore and Houdini appear in multiple films). Barney has stated that the films not only trace the formation of sexual definition but also the creative process of the artist: Cremaster 1 is the spark of an idea; Cremaster 2 is the rejection of the idea; Cremaster 3 is the artist falling in love with the idea; Cremaster 4 is panic at the knowledge that the idea is about to come to fruition; Cremaster 5 is the final resolution.   Completed in 2014, River of Fundament is one of Barney's most challenging and ambitious projects to date, and certainly the first major series by the artist since the legendary Cremaster cycle. The Rived of Fundament and the Cremaster Cycle have a similar length and represent some of the largest filmic undertakings in contemporary video art. Over five hours long, River of Fundament is a liquid spectacle of words and music, mercury and sulfur, molten iron, blood and feces, polluted industrial rivers in New York and Detroit, a river in Idaho where sockeye salmon go to spawn and die. Rivers of shit run through it. “I am asking a lot of the audience, for sure. It's not for everyone.”[3] This masterpiece is directly inspired by Norman Mailer's Egyptian novel Ancient Evenings, his infamous classic that chronicled the passage of a narrator through the stations of death and reincarnation. In a sequence of unique live performances, a series of massive sculptures, and, finally, a marathon-length opera in cinematic form, made with the artist's longtime collaborator, the composer Jonathan Bepler, Barney has elaborated a richly perverse and complex universe in which mythology, iconography, narrative, sex, and death are inextricably entwined.[4] After playing the escapologist Harry Houdini in 1999 Cremaster 2, Mailer recommended his book to Barney. At first, the artist was dubious. Much of Mailer's lengthy novel is extracted from The Egyptian Book of the Dead, which itself exists in many variants. It took the author a decade to write it – Barney worked on this project for seven years. The ending result is an impeccably shot video, with stunning visuals. The music was composed and directed by Jonathan Bepler, whose works corresponds wonderfully with the magnificence of the visuals.     Despite changing technologies, contemporary drawing, as a means to describe and think our world, remains central to the creative process. It is a basic form of human expression capable of communicating across all kinds of cultural borders. Drawing has always been an incredibly important part of Matthew Barney’s practice: his first major work, completed while still at Yale Art School, involved him creating a wall drawing while harnessed to the ceiling of his studio.[5] In contrast to his films and live events, which have in some instances involved hundreds of participants, Drawing Restraint is Barney’s solo mode of practice. Prior to his exhibitions being made public, Barney will typically deploy trampolines, hoists and technical climbing equipment to ascend and traverse the otherwise empty spaces. Through this process, these architectural confines become the restraining element of Barney’s expanded drawing procedures. The residue and marks that result from these interactions index the artist’s contact with his environment, resulting in site-specific works that make a subject of the artist’s body and its physical limitations.

Juan Usle,"Juan Uslé is a Spanish painter influenced by ideas ranging from philosophy to multiculturalism and known for his use of color and abstraction. Born in 1954 in Santander, Spain, Uslé lives and works in New York and Saro. He studied fine art at Escuela Superior de Belles Artes in San Carlos, Valencia from 1973 to 1977. He has had numerous solo and group exhibitions across Europe, North America and South America, including venues such as Museu D'Art Contemporani D' Eivissa MACE, Ibiza, Frith Street Gallery, London, Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany, Centro de Arte Contemporáneo, Málaga, SMAK, Stedelijk Museum voor Actuale Kunst, Ghent, IMMA, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Palacio de Velazquez, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, and Centro Cultural Caja de Cantabria. Uslé's work is held in various collections, both public and private, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MACBA, Museu d’Art Contemporani, Barcelona, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Centre Pompidou, Paris, Museo Guggenheim, Bilbao, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, Stedelïjk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Ghent and Tate Modern, London. Uslé creates abstractions evocative of the colors, light and space of his Northern Spanish homeland and the density, energy and unpredictability of New York City. Dividing his time between Spain and New York, he says he has always felt a sense of displacement, which is an important theme in his work.",750
Terence Netter,"Terence Netter is a renowned American painter and professor. His work can be separated into three groups – the paintings created during his priesthood, and those painted later on in his life under the influence of Zen, plus a series of paintings inspired by the 9/11 terrorist attack.  Terence Netter was raised in Bronxville, NY. In 1953 he received a BA degree in English from Fordham University. A year later, Netter obtained an MA degree in Philosophy from the same university. However, his education didn’t end here. In 1965, he graduated from George Washington University, acquiring an MFA degree in Studio Art. He joined the Jesuit order after graduating from Georgetown Prep. He held many teaching positions over the years that followed.  Throughout those years he held many one man shows, the first being in 1965 at the Allen Funt Gallery on Madison Avenue, after which he was dubbed “The Priest who Paints”. He left the Jesuit order in 1968, however, only to marry Therese Franseze not long after. After resigning from his post at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, he joined the Woodward Gallery, New York, where he held a one man exhibition in 1997-1998. It was in the same year that Netter and his wife obtained a house in Loire Valley, France, where he has spent a lot of time writing and painting since.  He was commissioned to create a series of paintings for the inaugural exhibition of the Eur Am Center for International Studies at the Abbey only months before the 9/11 attack. The paintings Netter produces were strongly influenced by this incident. Another series of paintings, Zenscapes: Aires de la Loire, was displayed at Gallery North in Setauket in 2004. Beyond the Horizon and French Perspectives followed, and in all of these paintings the influence the Loire had made on Netter was reflected. They made his interest in Zen meditation apparent, as well. His most recent project was the series of paintings named The Creation Series, or Illuminations. These were made in a strong reference to the Old Testament, much like the works in the Book of Kells. They were shown in 2015 at Gallery North and Woodward Gallery, the two galleries that represent him.  All images copyright © the artist and Woodward Gallery",751
Cildo Meireles,"Cildo Meireles is a Brazilian conceptual and installation artist who was one of the pioneers when it comes to showing resistance to political regime in Brazil. His work is quite diverse, ranging from large installations and walkable labyrinths to fake banknotes and Coca Cola bottles with subversive messages. Meireles wants his audience to experience and understand his art through direct interaction and this is one of the reasons why installation became his favorite means of self-expression. Also, his art is entirely conceptual, because the artist’s ideas take a strong precedence over common aesthetic values.  Meireles was born in the late 40s and showed a strong interest and passion when it comes to visual arts, especially drawing, sculpture and even animation. Meireles' father, who worked for the Indian Protection Service in Brazil, was glad to support his son’s creativity. Meireles believes that growing up in the Brazilian countryside, which is quite poor and dangerous, had a strong impact on his artistic tendencies. He was often wondering about the destiny of beggars he was meeting on the streets of Brazil every day. Meireles was curious about what they eat and where they sleep and wanted to investigate their lifestyle, which was an unusual interest for a young boy. Meireles claims that this interest in poverty and social injustice and willingness to provide help to those who really need it was the most important path he decided to follow in his life. Also, while he was growing up in rural Brazil, Meireles became aware of the lifestyle and culture of the Tupi people, who are the most important indigenous peoples in Brazil, and later on included in his projects the idea of their marginalization in the Brazilian society. Meireles started to study fine arts in 1963 at the District Federal Cultural Foundation in Brasilia. In the late 1960s he discovered the Neo-Concrete movement which was becoming popular in Brazil and felt that he has a lot in common with Neo–Concrete artists, who are typical for their strategy of blurring the line between fabricated and real life and using their style as a straightforward and bold response to the ongoing political affairs. Meireles happened to participate in the political demonstrations taking place in Brazil in the mid-60s and he considered them his own political awakening. The artist moved from the countryside to Rio de Janerio in 1967, where he continued to study at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes.   Until 1968, Meireles’ primary means of self-expression was expressionistic drawing. However, in the 70s, he completely abandoned this style and became interested in constructing various things, which was the very beginning of his career in installation. Meireles was very curious about the concept of the impermanence as well as the installation objects that exist only through the interaction with the audience. For example, his earliest experimental piece called Virtual Spaces aimed to show to the audience how objects are defined by three different planes (length, height and width) in human perception. In the 60s, Meireles’ interest in politics was as strong as his interest in art and his plan was to find some clever approach and make artworks which are subversive but delicate and never aggressive. Dadaism was one of his main sources of inspiration, because of its irony and tongue-in-cheek approach. Meireles' work can be divided into 5 series, each of them relying on the different concept and different objects. His earliest series, Red Shift (1967-84), consists of three rooms painted in red and the concept behind them relates to the scientific term called chromatic aberration, which Meireles used as a synonym for deviations of the society and politics. His second series, called Southern Cross, is a collection of small sculptures, dedicated to the Tupi people. The sculptures are tiny cubes made of pine and oak three, which are considered sacred trees of the Tupi people. Meireles’ third and most famous series, called Insertions Into Ideological Circuits (1970-76) is the most political among the artist’s works and it’s goal, which is already explained by the title itself , is to insert counter-information or different, revolutionary thought into a huge system of information or products. Large American corporations such as Coca-Cola were Meireles’ main target. His last two series, called Through (1983-89) and Babel (2001), are featuring equally interesting concepts. Through is an elaborate labyrinth built for experiencing an awkward tension between various visual and audio inputs, while Babel relates to the mythical tower of Babel and the idea of unity in spite of the obvious language barriers.   Meireles created his most famous series, called Insertions Into Ideological Circuits, in the 70s, around the time when Brazil was experiencing the most oppressive political period. Insertions were Meireles’ response to the current political situation and his rebellion towards the censorship that was enforced at that time. This series consists of two parts, called Coca Cola project, and the Banknote project. The artist had very clear ideas about the principles he wanted to incorporate into these two projects – and it was to disrupt the already existing system of circulated information by inserting a piece of ideologically different or revolutionary information. This was achieved by printing messages onto various well-known goods such as Coca-Cola bottles and American banknotes. Meireles wanted to make people aware of their role in the capitalist and consumerist society through the use of anti-imperialist propaganda. For example, Meireles made a large Zero Dollar tag for his replica banknotes and coins and he modified American bottles by printing subversive messages such as Yankees Go Home. In the 1970s in Brazil, Cola-Cola was a symbol of the US consumerism and the perfect target for Meireles’ ideas. The artist commented on his project: The Insertions into Ideological Circuits arose out of the need to create a system for the circulation and exchange of information that did not depend on any kind of centralized control. This would be a form of language, a system essentially opposed to the media of press, radio and television.   Meireles became widely renown for his controversial work which is exploring a wide array of issues which aren’t only political. He is a versatile and extremely prolific artist who had countless exhibitions worldwide and won many awards for his ingenious work. The first presentation of the artist’s entire body of work opened at Tate Modern in 2008 and he was the first Brazilian artist that was given such significant retrospective by Tate Modern. Also in 2008, he won the Velazquez Plastic Arts Award of the Ministry of Culture of Spain. The great impact and value of Meireles' work lie in his enormous efforts to interact with his audience and deliver his messages in innovative , insightful and above all meaningful ways.  ",752
Hongyu Zhang,"Coming from the culture where a painter is also a calligrapher and a poet, and where these three are defining an artist, Chinese artist Hongyu Zhang creates art rooted in the oldest artistic heritage in the history of mankind. The traditional Chinese painting has always been more about expressing artist’s feelings than painting a reality, and that is exactly what this young artist has to offer.  Zhang was born on the Mongolian vast plains, in China. When he was seven, Hongyu’s artistic education began: his uncle was a Fine Art teacher who initiated him into the world of calligraphy and a traditional Chinese painting. When the time came, he enrolled and graduated engraving at the Inner Mongolia’s School of Fine Arts. Later on, Zhang attended Beijing Language and Culture University. Becoming very curious about the western culture, inspired and fascinated by Kafka, Munch, Schiele, and Soutine – this artist headed for Europe for his further artistic education. He participated in the visual art section at Versailles School of Fine Arts, and a workshop at the Cité Internationale des Arts of Paris.   A blend of Chinese and European culture, both extremely dominant and rich, made Hongyu’s artistic world very eclectic - familiar and distant at the same time. Today, Zhang mostly uses Indian Ink, traditionally employed for the calligraphy – but, he also creates artworks in acrylic, oil paint or pastel. In the beginning of his career, the artist's style was abstract and colorful. That changed in 2006 when Zhang lost his dear mother. Naturally, this event is extremely intense per se, but when we have in mind that Zhang is an artistic soul, this loss becomes visibly powerful in a way that Hongyu discovered some new depths in himself, allowing this newly found material to come out and inhabit the canvas and paper. Colors disappeared and his painted world became black and white, with many shades of gray. This wasn’t a new place for Zhang. He grew up side by side with traditional calligraphy where other colors are used just in extremely rare situations, so one could say that this artistic metamorphosis was simply his back to the black case.   It was time to see a brand new mixture - his western experience embodied in an ancient Chinese technique. Zhang is best known for his portraits. However, people on the paintings simply do not exist. Each portrait represents the artist himself, in an effort to explore his inner being and create some kind of human landscape, where personality, experience, and emotion draw lines. Some of the techniques he learned in calligraphy actually allowed him more freedom in his brushstrokes. Being a completely disinterested in creating a precise portrait, grounded in reality only, the artist takes the viewer on the unexpected journey through his imagination. The artist is represented by the Artistics Gallery from Paris.  All images courtesy of Artistics Gallery",753
Hans Findling,"Looking at the photographs of Hans Findling it is hard to believe that behind the camera stands a young man of barely twenty years and, to get the story more interesting, he got interested into photography in 2010, at the age of only fourteen. He has shown incredible talent since the first shot made with his Canon EOS 450D and he has already accomplished several impressing portfolios and been awarded by many prestigious associations. His work reveals experienced professional with skillfully used natural lighting and dramatic angles.   This German artist grows up in the touristic area of Lake Constance which influenced on his sense for capturing stunning landscapes. Whether it's day or night, sunny or cloudy weather, his photographs are full of silence and calmness under the veil of mystery. His artistic talent was provoked since his early childhood when his grandmother, a painter, tried to animate him to take a brush. Today, his work includes different medium, but technical and aesthetical understanding and wealth of motifs originate exactly from painting.  Although using a variety of subjects, his images remain of the same quality, recognizable by their unique visual language.   Findling's architectural photos mostly represent subway stations around Europe. Using the bright lighting and monochrome surroundings, he exploits eye-catching patterns and lines that draw the viewer into the picture, dividing the spaces compositionally. He captures the moment with no people, or just with one or two passers-by, blurred in their irrelevance. His skillful use of long exposure is expressed on the photographs Matterhorn and Spinning, captured in Switzerland, that hypnotize the viewer with the play of mountain peaks in the dark night and stardust.    As Findling says, he has always loved the feeling of holding the professional camera in his hands. For the last six years, this young student spends most of his free time behind his camera and editing photographs. Received several awards, including the German Youth Photo Prize 2012 and the Audience Award at Cologne 2012 Design, his work has already been confirmed and recognized as the one that promises a lot in the years that are yet to come.

April Gornik,"American fine artist April Gornik is famous for her landscape paintings, drawings, and prints of the sea, lakes, fields, rain, and storms. She is a conceptual painter whose works combine violent weather conditions with the calm style of American Luminists. Since the 70s, she has been a seminal member of the New York art scene. Gornik’s work is included in a number of collections, including Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met), Hood Museum of Art, Nasher Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Whitney Museum of American Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, to name a few.   Born in 1953 in Cleveland, Ohio, Gornik received her B.F.A. from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (now called NSCAD University) in 1976. While attending the school, she met her future husband, painter Eric Fischl. Among the artist who influenced her work, she mentions Francesco Clemente, Amy Myers, Matthew Ritchie, David Salle, Barbara Takenaga, and Anselm Kiefer. Gornik’s paintings and drawings are done on plywood, oil on canvas, and pastel and charcoal on paper. Her work was first noticed by art dealer Ed Thorp in 1981 while viewing Fischl's paintings. Soon after, he hosted her first solo exhibition.    Throughout her career Gornik has had a deep connection with the feminist movement, expressing a concern that there is a constant underestimation of women painters. History is filled with examples of women that are always put behind the better known male artists. Gornik said:   In her work, Gornik focuses on colors and the light of the panoramas which is always an abstract and emotional space. Her paintings are imbued with dichotomies between past and present, stillness, and the inexorable momentum of atmospheric change that is part of the incoming storm. They are luminescent, yet there is an eerie quality to them that does not allow calm observation. Gornik’s paintings are not painted outside in the weather but inspired by photographs of landscapes. However, her painting can not be considered copies because they go through multiple changes as she refuses to limit her freedom by fixed choices. Instead, the painting process is fluid and ever-changing because she never knows what the final color, light, and composition will be. In her work, one can easily see the influence of Renaissance masters like Rubens, Matisse, and Kiefer.   Charged with powerful emotions Gornik’s paintings are breathtaking panoramas of American landscapes completely devoid of people. However, she loudly denies that she is an environmental artist, even though it is clear that her work is inspired by the troubling relationship America has with nature. They are rooted in observed and remembered reality that became abstracted. April Gornik lives and works in New York.  ",755
Ahn Hyun-Ju,"Ahn Hyun-Ju is a South Korean artist who has been dedicated to abstract painting for 15 years. Her work combines the use of vivid colors with interesting three-dimensional frameworks. The artist considers her pieces as volume painting and what is interesting about her background is the fact that she’s trained both in painting and sculpture. Such background helped Hyun-Ju to develop a strong sense of three-dimensionality, which is clearly visible in the majority of her works.  Ahn Hyun-Ju was born in 1969 in South Korea. Her artistic background is quite versatile – first, she studied sculpture at the Ewha Womans University in Seoul and afterwards she moved to Germany, where she continued her studies at the Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf. After she graduated in 2000, she decided to dedicate herself mainly to developing abstract works. Her pieces are characterized by painting directly onto three-dimensional frames made of aluminium. This approach is quite experimental, but Hyun-Ju was never afraid of novelties. Her artistic instincts lead into the research of unique painting techniques and unusual color combinations. In 2016, which means 16 years after the artist started to develop her own style, her oeuvre grew quite rich and her works have participated in several exhibitions in art galleries across Europe.   Hyun-Ju has experimented with many materials before she has finally settled on aluminium since she discovered that neutrality and stability of this materials go along with her ideas very well. Her work is strongly focused on the aesthetic aspects – she likes to play with different shapes, patterns, and colors. For example, in her series from 2013 called Irrational Symmetry, Hyun-Ju explores compositions which seem balanced without the use of horizontal or vertical lines. She is also known to be quite particular when it comes to her palette. The artist mixes acrylic paints with pigments and enjoys the novelty of such approach. The pigments she uses allow her to obtain different opacities and transparencies, which are used to achieve the layering effects, typical for her Dripping series, In these pieces, she combines monochromatic flats with color drippings, playfully creating a sense of chaos within the underlying order and simplicity.   Hyun-Ju’s work emphasizes the beauty of simplicity and avoids as much as possible inserting any symbolism or references to the past and history. She uses simple, most essential processes to convert her ideas into painting. Such basic approach gives her a lot of freedom and ability to let her imagination run wild. Nowadays, when the art in general is overwhelmed with the plentitude of references coming from the world of media and politics, Hyun-Ju’s beautiful simplicity represents a real jewel. The artist is represented by Artistics.  Featured Image: Artist's Portrait All images courtesy of Artistics gallery.",756

Mojoko,"Steve Lawler, the man behind Mojoko, reacts to the bombardment of bizarre images of today’s culture by creating various mutations and different view of the glossy yet undeniably trash pop world. His artwork is multi-faceted and innovative – Mojoko is into curation, installation, interactive design but also fine skills, such as painting, collage and drawing. During his dynamic career, he has worked with many cutting-edge artists, designers and animators worldwide, which allowed him to climb the corporate ladder and start operating a large network of over 600 most talented multimedia artists, known for their innovative and exciting label entitled Kult. [caption id=""attachment_295237"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Mojoko - Mysterious Island, 2016[/caption]  Steve Lawler aka Mojoko has a very colorful background - he is originally British, but he was born in Iran, raised in Hong Kong and he went to art schools in Europe. In 2001, Steve Lawler attended the prestigious FABRICA residency in Treviso, Northern Italy and consequently decided to launch his own interactive design career, since it would give him much more creative freedom. He started working at Diesel HQ and he was very successful and talented, which helped him climb through the creative industry all the way to the very top. He was initially an artist and designer, but he became an art director and a creative director as well, due to his excellent managing skills. In addition to these prestigious positions, Mojoko has also created the Kult brand, which refers to a magazine, gallery, and studio in Singapore.   Mojoko was founded in 2005, initially as a reaction to overuse of the digital technologies. Lawler’s main goal is to cover many different mediums and styles - from silkscreen to plastics. He combines most diverse old-school and modern approaches in order to create a bizarre mix of computer programming, digital sculpture, and printmaking, which perfectly represents the Trash Pop Culture. It is also important to note that Mojoko’s work is a great portrayal of life in modern Asia since he’s currently based in Singapore and every aspect of his work and even daily life is influenced by digital media, such as internet, TV and large outdoor advertisements. Lawler is also using a lot of imagery from both pop and traditional Asian and Western cultures in his collages, such as Chinese acupuncture posters, antique Chinese mirrors, and scenes from American cult horror movies, in order to emphasize the melting pot of various influences when it comes to 21st-century Asian lifestyle.

Francine Tint,"One of only a handful of old school painters left, Francine Tint is an American abstract expressionist painter who has been active on the scene for decades now. Her impressive canvas works are colorful, layered and evocative of the physicality behind her creative process. This New York-based painter explains her body of work with the following statement: My paintings are emotionally visceral, concentrating on color and motion. Through agitated, flustered, vehement, and even aggressive brushwork, with short, sharp, staccato bursts of color, my art expresses a unique sense of life and energy by utilizing light and surface.  In order to reach the current level of skill and art understanding, Tint studied at the Pratt Institute in New York, the Brooklyn Museum College. Additionally, she also attended classes at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture in Manhattan. As Francine was growing up both as a person and as a painter, she was a part of the scene at Kansas City. Here, the young painter developed her hand and met numerous colleagues of the same field, such as Forrest Myers and Brice Marden, as well as the famous critic Clement Greenberg. Since those early days of her career, Tint developed her artistic style and it did not change that much over the years, if even a bit. Her paintings inhabit a variety of scales, from massive, wall-sized canvases to smaller, more intimate works. The smaller paintings feature impasto surfaces that take on an almost sculptural presence, as explained by the painter herself: My small works also bring in a sculptural element, reshaping the canvas through the use of impasto, by having the paint come over the edges. In order to establish her artistic vocabulary, Tint incorporated different techniques, ranging from pouring and dripping to gestural brush marks and intuitive drawing. Physicality is a really important factor of her process - Francine interacts with her materials and surfaces through the use of fluid, intuitive gestures. Tint's    When you analyze her art, it comes as no surprise that Tint's key influence is Helen Frankenthaler. However, Francine also names the painter Hans Hofmann, the Spanish painter Antoni Tàpies and the American painter and printmaker Jules Olitski as her other sources of inspiration. Big shoes to fill, no doubt, but Tint proved herself to be a worthy name mentioned alongside such greats of art history. Francine Tint is represented by IdeelArt Gallery.  ",761

Claude Tetot,"Claude Tétot is a French abstract artist whose work expresses harmony in disharmony by exploring the enigmatic unity that can exist between seemingly disparate elements, such as graphic patterns and gestural markings. Tétot was born in 1960 in Angoulême, a small community in southwestern France, and today he lives and works in Savins, just south of Paris.  Tétot is inspired by the search for unexpected harmonies. He could be placed in an aesthetic lineage with Hans Hofmann and Shirley Jaffe. Like Hofmann, Tétot relishes the hand painted mark, and is masterful at expressing depth by allowing contrasts between hues and tints to speak for themselves. Like Jaffe, Tétot employs the white ground of his surfaces as if it is an expression of form, and he fearlessly embraces cacophony, revealing the strange harmonies that exist within apparent contradictions. Tétot then extends beyond the traditions of his Modernist influences. He simplifies his approach, creating compositions that speak abstractly, though directly, to universal themes, such as: chaos vs. order; the hand-drawn mark vs. the graphic pattern; and what is present vs. what is absent. At its most poetic, his work expresses unity between dissimilar elements; it finds beauty in discord.  Tétot employs different mediums and methods to achieve different types of attitudes in his compositions. Whether he is making a drawing or a painting, he may employ something like fluorescent acrylics to create a graphic pattern, a hard edged line or a geometric shape. Next, he may use oil paint and traditional brushes to create an expressive, gestural line, or a painterly field of color. The fluctuations between opacity and translucency, and flatness and luminosity, are important to the personality of the work. He has developed the technique of surface preparation so that nuanced differences can be expressed in his white backgrounds. The seemingly empty space on is in fact filled with subtle gradations that emphasizes relationships between colors, and adds depth to the spatial relationships between the various pictorial elements of the composition.  Tétot has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in galleries and museums in France, Luxembourg, and Germany. In addition to private collections, his work is in the permanent collections of the National Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris and the Regional Contemporary Art Fund, Auvergne.   ",765

He is the recipient of the prestigious Marcel Duchamp Prize in 2008 and the esteemed Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture in 2015.  Addressing science, fears, contemporary mythologies and the unknowable, Grasso created immersive installations by using video, sculpture, painting and archival photography. He is fascinated with the visual possibilities related to the science of electromagnetic energy, radio waves and naturally occurring phenomena, exploring how they apply to paranormal activity. Surreal and ambiguous, these works are at once a timeless and comprehensive synthesis of the past, present, and future. Often incorporating imagery culled from the cinema and art history, he intentionally manipulates them by imposing unique and unusual perspectives onto his subject matter. As he explains, ""the idea is to construct a floating viewpoint, thereby creating a discrepancy in relation to reality. We move from one viewpoint to another, and that's also how we manufacture states of consciousness."" Seeking to grasp, reveal, and materialize the invisible through his works, the artist immerses the viewer in an uncanny world of uncertainty. ",768
Audrey Barcio,"Audrey Barcio is an American abstract artist whose recent paintings examine where the heritage of Modernism intersects with the tools of the Virtual Industrial Age. Barcio earned her Bachelor of Arts Degree from Herron School of Art and Design in 2007. She earned her Masters of Fine Art from the University of Nevada Las Vegas in 2016. She studied at Pont Aven School of Contemporary Art, Brittany, France, in 2006, and earned a fellowship to attend the Vermont Studio Center in 2017.  For these works, Barcio begins by searching historical archives for Modernist abstract paintings that evoke in her a sense of the universal. She then pares down the visual languages of these paintings into new compositions that extend that historical lineage.  After preparing her raw canvases with a grey and white checkerboard pattern, she translates her pre-planned composition to that surface using acrylic paint. During this step, Barcio modifies the composition freely according to her visual instincts and subconscious intuition in a “call and response” process inspired by the thinking of Elaine de Kooning, who said, “A painting to me is primarily a verb, not a noun.”  Barcio is interested in the value of action and human labor over automation. Her work is inspired as much by esoteric fields like spirituality and mysticism as by formal aesthetics, both of which lead her to imbue her works with a sense of color and light.  Barcio is also inspired by the ideas of philosopher Hannah Arendt, who wrote about the importance of revealing meaning without defining it, the merit of action over fabrication, and the awareness that “every process is the cause of new processes.” These works express those inspirations by appropriating the iconic grey and white checkerboard pattern recognized by contemporary digital designers as the “Photoshop void,” a symbol for emptiness waiting to be filled. Barcio uses that support to empower contemporary interpretations of the iconographic legacy of Modernist aesthetic positions like Suprematism, Geometric Abstraction, Post-painterly Abstraction and Minimalism, transforming virtual nothingness into concrete form. The work is intended to transcend the accepted cultural raison d'être of this century—the cult of self—to evoke instead the universal.  About a 2016 Barcio installation, art journalist Dawn-Michelle Baude wrote,   Barcio has exhibited across the United States. Recent exhibitions include Tube Factory, Indianapolis, IN, Random Access, Syracuse, NY, Barrick Museum of Art, Las Vegas, NV, and Satellite Art Show, part of Art Week Miami. Her work has been featured in New American Paintings and is included in several public and private collections, including those of the Marjorie Barrick Museum and the Inspire Theater, Las Vegas, NV.

Asgar/Gabriel,"Asgar/Gabriel is an artistic duo consisting of Iran-born Daryoush Asgar, and Austria-born Elisabeth Gabriel. The two are focused on creating peculiar multilayered narratives by appropriating various oppositions such as the serious and the entertaining, masculinity and femininity, avant-garde and kitsch, etc. At the same time associative, psychedelic and ludacris, their canvases filled with collective bodies dispersed around the pictorial plain call for interaction. The proposed meta-reality is a manifestation of the artists' need to articulate the contemporaneity from a cynical socio-critical stance. ",772
Gabriel de la Mora,"A contemporary Mexican artist, Gabriel de la Mora is best known for constructing visual works from found, discarded, and obsolete objects. Through an obsessive process of collecting and fragmenting materials such as eggshells, shoe soles, speaker screens, feathers, he creates seemingly minimal and often monochrome-looking surfaces characterized by great technical complexity. Gabriel de la Mora is born in 1968 in Mexico City where he currently lives and works. He has BA in Architecture from Universidad Anáhuac del Norte, Mexico City, Mexico and MFA in Photography and Video from Pratt Institute, New York, NY, USA. After five years of practicing architecture, he redirected his work, focusing instead on visual art. He exhibited all over the world, including Mexico CityCity, Puebla, Oaxaca, Bogotá, New York, Houston, Washington DC, Long Beach, Paris, Madrid, Andoain, and London. Using a range of found objects that he has been collecting since 2000, he transforms them into works of art through meticulous craftsmanship, calling attention to their original uses and examining the nature of art itself. By repurposing objects that have been discarded and declared useless, he points to the actions of time upon the object. Working between painting, drawing, and sculpture and experimenting with their limits, he reveals the intimate and personal within the universal convention of modernist abstraction. ",773
Markus Linnenbrink,"A German contemporary artist, Markus Linnenbrink creates paintings that are described as both performative and extreme. His decadently colorful drip paintings and striped room-size environments evoke the stripe paintings of Morris Louis and Gene Davis. Born in 1961 in Dortmund, Germany, Linnenbrink currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York, USA. After finalizing his studies 1988 at the Academy of Fine Arts, Berlin, Germany, he started his artistic career by showing in several galleries and institutions in Germany and then globally.

Color and process are Linnenbrink’s primary concerns. In his works, the artist incorporates wobbly vertical stripes and dots of bright, glossy color. Pouring and pooling resin with cumulative layers of opaque and translucent pigments, he builds the dramatic physicality of his objects. His earlier works relied on the interplay between liquidity and gravitational pull, while later surface derivations were created with mechanical assistance. ",774

Mary Sibande,"A South African artist, Mary Sibande uses mediums such as sculptures, paintings, photography, and design to help depict the human form and explore the construction of identity in a postcolonial South African context. Born in Barberton, South Africa in 1982 in apartheid, Sibande is currently based in Johannesburg. Born to a mother who was a domestic worker and father who was in the South African Army, she was raised by her grandmother. Sibande received her diploma in Fine Arts from the Technikon Witwatersrand in 2004 and obtained a B-tech degree from the University of Johannesburg in 2007. For Sibande, the body and particularly how we clothe it, is the site where this history is contested and where Sibande's own fantasies can play out. In her work, she often uses an alter-ego by the name of ""Sophie"", whose body and dress became a site for writing a counter-history. Throughout her practice, she has used her work to expose a range of issues, from postcolonial South Africa to stereotypes of women as well as stereotypes regarding black women in South Africa. As she once explained, her work is ""about celebrating what we are as women in South Africa today."" ",776

Her practice references Brazilian Constructivism, Arte Povera, and Minimalism. ",778

Alice Baber,"A painter, printmaker, curator, feminist and writer, Alice Baber is best known for her Abstract Expressionist paintings in watercolor and oil that explored ""the infinite range of possibilities"" of color and light within and from the form of the circle. Born in Charleston Illinois, Baber began drawing at the age of eight, becoming so advanced by the age of twelve that she was enrolled in a college-level class. She attended Lindenwood College for Women in Missouri, where she spent two years before transferring to Indiana University where she studied under the figurative expressionist, Alton Pickens. She also studied briefly at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and lived in Paris in the late 1950s and 1960s. Working in both oil and watercolor paints, she perceived the circle as possessing an infinite range of possibilities for exploration of color and light. Color was one of main components of her art, seeking to satisfy an indulgence in what she described as ""color hunger"". Focusing on composition, transparency, color, and line, she aimed to depict the form of a feeling through the use of intense pigments. She was also instrumental in curating and organizing exhibitions of women artists, most notably Color, Light and Image, an international exhibition of 125 artists in 1975.

Bea Garding Schubert,"Bea Garding Schubert is a German contemporary artist whose abstract paintings are driven by the idea of inspiring hope and happiness. The birds, windows, landscapes and infinite imaginary worlds emerge from the canvas, combined with hidden written messages inspired by songs and stories. Perfectly aware of the artists’ ability to bring positive energy into society and influence change for the better, Schubert is encouraging people to open their hearts, eyes, and minds. “Home”, her latest series, focuses on some of the most positive things in the world - confidence, hope, trust, and the very feeling of being at home and at peace. Experimentally driven, the free-flowing expression is the basis for all of her paintings. There are no limits even in the choice of materials - brush, spray, drip, squeegee… After completing her studies at Braunschweig University of Art, she traveled the world for 8 years. On foot, nonetheless! With her life’s possessions in her backpack, no phone or any other means of communication, nothing but the things she truly needed. She traversed Europe, the Middle East, Morocco, Australia, India, Asia, as well as North and South America, living in and with nature. That period of her life helped define who Bea Garding Schubert is as an artist, and more importantly, who she is as a human being, providing her with a sense of freedom, liberation, and faith. Schubert lives and works between Germany and Spain. ",786
Torge Steffens,"Torge Steffens is a German artist and designer born in Bremervoerde (Bremervörde). From his early childhood, he was always into music and arts, learning to play the violin, guitar, and the piano, but also spending a lot of time painting. Upon finishing high school, he had to choose between studying music or art. In the end, he chose Design (Communication Design, to be precise), which turned out to be a really good decision. At this time Steffens was inspired by artists like Egon Schiele and Horst Janssen. He started painting “seriously” when he was 16-17 years old, developing his style and technique during his studies (1996-1999).  For three years after graduating, he worked as a designer at Windi Winderlich, followed by four more years of freelance work at Peter Schmidt, syndicate, Lothar Böhm, Brand Union, etc. In 2006, he co-founded VISID, a design agency that is specialized in packaging design and product branding for fast-moving consumer goods, successfully developing innovative and long-lasting design solutions for brands.

Darae Jeon,"Darae Jeon is a Korean contemporary abstract artist who uses luminous, cool colors and whimsical, calligraphic lines to build her paintings in hopes of communicating joy. Believing that art has the exquisite power to offer emotional and spiritual pleasure, she always seeks her inner light, “finding a peaceful and meditative aura in my work. I want to catch and represent spiritual happiness through a continuing inner dialogue on canvas.” Jeon uses an all-over compositional strategy reminiscent of the early Abstract Expressionists, creating paintings that are layered, complex, and evoke a sense of visual harmony and balance. Instead of searching for meaning in her works, she hopes to provide her viewers with comfort and the opportunity to open themselves to the feelings the works inspire. Based in Seoul, Darae Jeon studied at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA, USA, where she graduated in 2013.   ",790
Diana Krinninger,"German painter Diana Krinninger employs compositional strategies related to landscape and still life painting to create abstract works that express an almost architectural sense of space. The brut, colorful forms that inhabit her paintings have an ambiguous presence, somewhere between an organic entity and an erasure, and often trick the eye into wondering about the nature of the visual space. It is unclear whether we are looking at geometries or geologies in these paintings. Should we be seeking connections with an abstract landscape, or simply admiring the formal and visceral qualities of her shapes, lines, colors, textures and forms? Whether abstract or figurative, her works express an experimental, emotive energy—evidence of the personal, intuitive approach she takes to painting. Based in Hauzenberg, Germany, Krinninger studied at the Art Academies of Salzburg and Kolbermoor. Her work has been included in solo and group exhibitions and art fairs throughout Germany and the UK.

A dazzling balance between object figuration and pure abstraction, Melini's colorful, pattern-filled works combine the geometric composition and authority of Cubism with the disorienting visual chaos of Op Art. In his recent works, the artist experimented with layering different textures over his signature geometric patterns with thick paint strokes, making his works more pictorial in nature. ",792
Nuge,"Nuge (pronounced ""NOOJ"") is a contemporary artist who creates organic forms out of wood that are in stark contrast to the hard lines and rigid nature of architecture. His work today, in essence, is a rebellion against his architectural background. The artist studied at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, where he earned his Master’s degree in Architecture. However, after several years in the field, he realized his working experience was sharply different from his creative and intensive studies. While studying, he was able to be as imaginative and wild as possible, and the work tied him down to a computer, drawing construction documents and rearranging condominium layouts. That’s why he decided to make a change, venturing into the woodwork, which allows his work to be fluid, energetic, and connected to humans. These elements compel him to create everything by hand. The method requires a great deal of patience, but it also means Nuge can revisit his work daily.",793
Kathleen Jacobs,"Kathleen Jacobs is an American artist known for her lyrical yet minimal canvases that engage both with the natural world and late 20th-century minimalism. After she started painting outdoors, first in the forests of Colorado and then in the woods of Massachusetts, she decided to use tree bark as the surface for her works. Working with raw linen or canvas, Jacobs wraps and re-wraps the material on multiple tree trunks. It is then subjugated to various gessoes and rubs and left to absorb the influences of weather patterns and the trees' evolution. These paintings are left outdoors for as long as two years, allowing them to weather and mature, creating a unique surface. In the last phase, the artist moves these aged paintings back into the studio, painting and reworking the marks begun by her and taken up by her environment. Kathleen Jacobs attended Pine Manor College in Boston before relocating to Milan in 1980 to study graphic design at the Scuola Politecnica di Design (SPD). She lives and works in Great Barrington, MA.",794

Nian,"Nian is an Italian artist whose female figures gather the sacredness of the present and the spirit of the earth, embracing the atavistic strength with their long intertwined limbs. Located somewhere between magical realism and primitivism, her figurative works occur in alienating settings, as suggested by the artist's lucid dream and her continuous stylistic evolution. With the softness of the lines, the harmonization of emotion, and the chromatic expressionism, Nian's visual identity is easily recognizable. Proving to be more than capable of undressing her artistic sensitivity to the most visceral unconscious, her subjects (bodies, portraits, and faces) celebrate the contemplative capacity of humans and our need to transcend our contradictions and find our place in the world. Nian lives and works in Florence.   ",807

Ian Laurie,"Ian Laurie is a British artist whose work has evolved from sketches, limited edition etchings, to paintings. He often depicts the Cornish landscape. ",820
Gordon Anderson,"The practice of the Canadian artist Gordon Anderson is rooted in the tradition of reductive formalism. His works often combine a photographic component of architectural detail from a variety of monumental structures, sports stadiums, factories, silos, and power plants, which are centrally located within a surrounding monochromatic color field. For the past fifteen years, he has exhibited in a range of venues, including Christopher Cutts Gallery, John Willmott Architect Inc, Wave Gallery, D & E Lake, No Parking, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, London Regional Art, and Historical Museums, London, Robert McLaughlin Gallery.   Gordon Anderson manages to capture the raw beauty of monumental settings that, at the first glance, appears empty and devoid of any aesthetic value. For example, in his series of artworks depicting the factory settings, the artist takes closeups of interconnected pipes that make no sense and appear to serve no clear purpose. His artworks are delivered without the artist's impute or any kind of interpretation. They are honest and raw, and it is up to the viewer to interpret them.   Anderson always considered that there is more power in an image than in words. The style that he perfected over the years was highly influenced by the artist of the  World War l era. Part of the reason for this is that he comes from a long line of military men. In a way, his rich oeuvre is a testament to his heritage. Throughout his work, he aims to preserve the eery beauty of these spaces so they are never forgotten by the future. Anderson sees them as a testament to the past that shows the struggles and sacrifices of working men.   Born in 1965 in Oakville, Ontario, he graduated from the Ontario College of Art in 1989. Anderson's canvases and photographs depict enormous sites of industry, eerily absent of the workers. Featuring a collection of empty sports stadiums, steel mills, and motionless assembly plants, these works are meant to illustrate the evolving landscape of the large-scale industry in the once illustrious rust belt in Ohio, Detroit, and Hamilton landscape. The factory complex that is usually seen as ugly and uninviting, Anderson transforms into real sculptures. Even though they might appear ugly to some, the genius of their construction and the high technical level can not be ignored.   Gordon Anderson currently lives and works in Hamilton, Ontario.  ",821

Frank Stella,"One of the most iconic figures that emerged from the post-World War II American art, Frank Stella is a painter and a printmaker whose influential work is considered to be crucial to the generations of artists that moved beyond Abstract Expressionism. Abandoning the concepts of this relatively loose movement, Stella set his creative course down the path of Minimalism, playing a major role in writing out one of the most important late 20th century chapters in 20th century art. Frank went through many phases and stages during his career[1], from his banishments of symbols to his image reductions to his strict geometric forms. However, all Stella did can be linked to his famous and playful saying that can easily describe every single piece of art Frank ever created: What you see is what you see. This is often considered to be the unofficial credo firmly standing behind the conceptual basis of all the varied Stella's art-making practices.  Frank Stella was born during the year of 1936 in Malden, a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. His family was of Italian descent. Although Frank's father was a gynecologist and had no particular affection towards creativity, Stella's mother was an artistically inclined housewife who attended fashion school and later took up landscape painting. Her influence will prove to be of great use for the young author during the times he was forming his own visual vocabulary. Whilst still attending classes at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Frank learned about abstract modernists Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann. This experience inspired him to pursue an artistic career and, with that goal in mind, Stella enrolled with the Princeton University where he majored in history and met the likes of Darby Bannard and Michael Fried[2]. The young artist started visiting New York on a regular basis, frequently touring through local galleries that truly fostered his initial artistic development. After he graduated and received his diploma, Frank moved completely to The Big Apple in the year of 1958. Three years later, he married Barbara Rose, a woman that will later become a well-respected art critic.  Early on, Frank Stella's visual vocabulary was heavily shaped by the influences of the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline[3]. Right from the very start, he reacted against the popular expressive use of paint by most artists of the abstract expressionist movement, instead claiming that opting for flatter surfaces normally found in the arsenal of Barnett Newman or Jasper Johns. Furthermore, he insisted that the painting is nothing more than a flat surface with some paint on it, completely avoiding any symbolic qualities that some believed are the essential core of the painterly compositions. Such an approach led Stella down a very minimalistic path, as evidenced by his Black Paintings series. In these, regular bands of black paint were separated by very thin pinstripes of unpainted canvas, as the case is with the Die Fahne Hoch! (1959) piece. Besides being the perfect indicator of the author's style, this painting is also believed to be linked to the famous American flags project of Jasper Jones. Emotional coolness was what separated him from the majority of his contemporary colleagues and is the exact reason why he was so well received by the public. It should also be noted that Stella’s art was recognized for its innovations before the author turned the age of twenty-five, meaning that Frank was forced to withstand heavy expectations and pressures when he was still a very young man.   Starting with the year of 1960, Stella began to produce paintings in aluminum and copper paint, introducing a variety of new and refreshing factors to his work. However, these pieces all followed the conceptual lead of his earlier works, although they did use a lot more colors than their predecessors. These paintings were also the first ones for which the artist used shaped canvases that avoided the traditional rectangle and square forms. These surfaces were oftentimes in the shape of letters, usually the L, N, U or T-shapes. As he matured, Frank turned these into much more elaborate designs, as exampled by the 1967's series titled simply as The Polygon. Stella began his extended engagement with printmaking in the mid-1960s as well. He utilized a wide range of printmaking techniques, including lithography, screenprinting, etching and the offset lithography[4]. In 1970, The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a retrospective of Stella’s work and he became the youngest author to receive this kind of recognition. During the following decade, Stella also introduced elements of relief into his art - these he came to call maximalist paintings for their unique sculptural qualities and visuals. The 1990s and the 2000s were marked by the continuation of experimentation as Frank never ceased to test the boundaries of materials, three-dimensionality and forms. Stella also began making freestanding sculptures for public spaces and even developing architectural projects[5] from time to time.   What Frank Stella ultimately managed to achieve, what makes him so invaluable to all of art, is the fact he was able to make paintings in which pictorial force came not from symbolic meanings but from the very materiality of the piece. Such a contribution to the neo avant-garde currents of the 20th-century makes this author arguably one of the most important living American authors[6]. Stella has a specific relationship with all the pieces he made and dedicated much of his efforts to explain this correlation. Without wanting to give our interpretation, we prefer to quote Stella himself and allow the artist to both have the last say in this article and explain in his own words his own art: ""No art is any good unless you can feel how it’s put together. By and large it’s the eye, the hand and if it’s any good, you feel the body. Most of the best stuff seems to be a complete gesture, the totality of the artist’s body; you can really lean on it.""

Nan Goldin,"Widely treated as one of the most controversial and uncompromising modern photographers to date, Nan Golden is an American artist famed for her personal documentation of alternative life choices in the United States. Throughout her career, she made projects and series based on many provocative topics, highlighted by her takes on drag queens, sexual acts and the downfalls of drug dependency. What makes her work even more exciting and frightening is that Golden fully emerges herself inside the worlds she captures within her frame, believing that only her full-time presentence is capable of providing the most honestly brutal depictions possible out of her chosen subjects.  Nan Goldin was born in the capital city of Washington but spent her childhood in the Boston suburb of Lexington. A child of middle-class Jewish parents, young Goldin had a father that worked in broadcasting and was a chief economist for the Federal Communications Commission. However, when Nan was about 13-14 years of age, she left home for good. She started to attend classes at the Satya Community School in an attempt to find herself a new place to call home. It was in this school that philosopher Rollo May’s daughter introduced Nan to her first camera in the year of 1968. Fascinated by the possibilities of photography, Goldin started to explore what cameras were capable of. Her early influences were found in Pop art movies, Federico Fellini, Jack Smith, Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton - additionally, she enjoyed both French and Italian editions of Vogue, more precisely, the photos these magazines utilized. Slowly, but surely, Nan's name was starting to find its way to photo pundits around the state of Massachusetts. Her first solo show was held in Boston in the year of 1973 and was based on her documentation of city's gay and transsexual communities that were extremely marginalized at the time. Nan was introduced to this alternative lifestyle by her friend David Armstrong and homosexual communities would become one of Goldin's focal points in terms of her artistic output. It should be noted that she was not the only photographer working with the infamous drag queens - however, most other artists were trying to analyze the gay's psyche or simply expose them to the public, whilst Goldin admired and celebrated their sexuality, as well as their bravery. Concerning this early part of her career, she once stated the following: My desire was to show them as a third gender, as another sexual option, a gender option. And to show them with a lot of respect and love, to kind of glorify them because I really admire people who can recreate themselves and manifest their fantasies publicly. I think it’s brave.[1] Furthermore, Goldin also admitted that she was romantically in love with one of the drag queens who were her early subjects, so that put an additional emotional and personal note to her pictures. Soon, Nan started to live with the drag queens full time, literally becoming a part of their everyday world. And they became a vital part not only of her career but of her entire life which was completely immersed in the queens. However, that special bond was forced to a breaking point when Nan started to go to the school of Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, seeking advancement in the field of photo making. Luckily, one of her professors demanded that she goes back and photograph the queens again. Although this provided Nan with a lot of familiar pleasure, her pictures were ultimately far inferior when compared to her earlier, more honest photos made during her actual long term stay with the gay individuals. Eventually, Goldin graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Tufts University in 1978, with her highlight project mostly concentrating on Cibachrome prints. Much of that work can be associated in one way or another with the Boston School of photography. Following graduation, Goldin moved to New York City, seeking new surroundings, opportunities and challenges.    When she made her way to the New York City, Goldin began documenting the post-punk new-wave music scene. Yet again she wanted to emerge herself into a subculture, believing that the magical aspect of her earlier work was directly associated with her commitment to spend most of her time with the chosen subjects. Becoming a part of the music scene also meant Nan was in direct contact with the city's vibrant, post-Stonewall gay subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s, oftentimes considered to be a key time of the homosexual modern history. Furthermore, Goldin was drawn especially to the hard-drug subculture of the Bowery neighborhood - most of these photographs were taken between the years of 1979 and 1986, amounting to an impressive project titled The Ballad of Sexual Dependency[2]. The name of the series was taken from a song in Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera. These snapshot aesthetic pictures were published with help from Marvin Heiferman, Mark Holborn and Suzanne Fletcher. They mostly focus on depicting drug use, violence and aggressive couples, all underlined by carefully implemented autobiographical moments that show a transition through Nan’s travels and life. Goldin described this rather personal project as a diary of both herself and her peers, individuals she liked referring as her tribe. Unfortunately, most of Nan's Ballad subjects were dead by the 1990s, as the AIDS and overdoses proved to be fatal for many addicts who were her close friends and often-photographed subjects. Nevertheless, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency managed to document their downfall with much grace and celebration of life despite the dark context and the inevitable ending. Over fifteen years after its release, this project's impact was nodded by The New York Times. The famed magazine described the series as a unique take on the 80s subculture unrivaled by any other photographic piece of documentation. The New York Times also stated that Goldin forged a genre of her own. It should be noted that the legendary Ballad photos were not limited to only one project as these images were combined with pictures from two other series: I'll Be Your Mirror and All By Myself.    Over the years, Goldin has always preferred to present her work in a form of a slideshow, believing that the images make full sense only when they are presented as a whole. This way they are able to tell a full story and not only reveal some aspects taken from an entire narrative. Due to this choice of the slideshow presentation, Goldin's photos have often been shown at film festivals - her most famous show was a 45-minute long collection of over 800 pictures displayed. It's interesting that her early works which explored themes of love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality were usually shot with available light, whilst more mature and darker topics of her later career do not share the same characteristic. Another common aspect of Goldin's art is affectionately documentation of women looking in mirrors[3] - this has been a recurring theme in many of her projects as Nan photographed hundreds of subjects this way. These kinds of compositions are intended to present private journals made public - a regular goal of Goldin's portfolio. Her personal relationship with both the subjects and the photos is rather unique, as she explains in her book Auto-Focus - her images are described as a way to document the stories and intimate details of her and those closest to her. This book as well speaks of her uncompromising and unrelenting manner when photographing acts such as drug use, sex, violence and heated arguments. It also references one of Goldin’s famous photographs, the Nan One Month After Being Battered - this iconic 1984 photo depicts the artist with severe bruises all over her face. Goldin's work since 1995 has included a wide array of subject matters, with most impressive projects including the likes of the collaborative book with Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki, depictions of New York City skylines, mysterious landscapes and images of her lover, Siobhan. She also garnered a lot of media attention for her pictures of babies that centered on emphasizing parenthood and family life. Goldin has also undertaken an expansion to commercial fashion photography, working usually for Australian label Scanlan & Theodore and Italian luxury label Bottega Venet.  In the more recent periods of her career, Goldin seems to have expanded her art to the field of installation. In the year of 2006, her exhibition titled Chasing a Ghost opened in New York and it was the first show to display her installation, a piece heavily relied on moving pictures, disturbing video and a narrative score. However, her earlier projects seem to have stayed the definite highlight of her career and this is intended as in no way disrespectful towards her installation works - her drag queen depictions and The Ballad of Sexual Dependency are simply so fantastic and unparalleled that they are impossible to top. They will surely enter art history as some of the most iconic pieces depicting the subcultures of the late 20th century - if they haven't already made their way into legends.  This artist is represented by Gagosian Park & 75 New York, Gagosian West 24th Street New York, Gagosian Beverly Hills, Gagosian Britannia Street London and Gagosian West 21st Street New York.

Christo and Jeanne-Claude,"One of the most famous artistic duos emerging from the 20th century, Christo Vladimirov Javacheff and Jeanne-Claude Denat were a married couple who authored iconic environmental works of art. They are responsible for some of the most influential pieces of that particular artistic field, such as the wrapping of the Reichstag in Berlin, Running Fence in Sonoma and The Gates in New York City's Central Park. Despite their pieces being visually stunning due to their scale and oftentimes cloaked in controversy, Christo and Jeanne-Claude repeatedly rejected all theories that their projects contain any kind of deeper meaning other than their immediate aesthetic impact. The duo instead claimed that creating art was a process based on nothing but joy and beauty of finding new ways to present already familiar landscapes.   Christo Vladimirov Javacheff was born on the 13th of June in 1935, in the town of Gabrovo, a city in northern Bulgaria. His father was a hard worker and a businessman who ran a fabric factory whilst his mother was a secretary at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sofia. Ever since an early age, Christo was more attracted to the world in which his mother worked then his dad's factory - oftentimes, professors from the Academy would visit the Javacheff home and discuss arts with young Christo. It came as no surprise that the youngest member of the Javacheff family eventually started to attend classes at the Sofia Academy but no one expected him to display such a rebellious and unique artistic personality. After spending three years at the Academy, Christo went to Prague in 1957 - from here, he managed to get himself illegally to the West by bribing a railway official and stowing away with several other individuals on board a train transporting medicine and medical supplies into Austria. He settled in Vienna and enrolled at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts but was yet again unable to feel satisfied with the surroundings. In the year of 1958, Christo moved to Paris, hoping that the City of Light will be ready to offer him all the artistic options Sofia, Prague and Vienna were not able to. This period of his life was marked by both financial hardship and social isolation due to not knowing the French language. Christo was earning money by painting low-cost portraits and was starting to feel that the move to Paris was a big mistake - little did he know that his world was about to take a major turn for the better as he was about to meet the love of his life. In one of the most bizarre and romantic coincidences[1] of art history, Jeanne-Claude Denat was born on the same day and year as Christo Javacheff. She grew up in Casablanca, Morocco, where her French military father was stationed at the time. Her dad was a single parent and Jeanne-Claude's childhood was marked by loneliness as she grew up in a foreign country and had but one custodian who was often away on military duties. In 1952, she graduated from the University of Tunis, earning a degree in Latin and philosophy. Five years later, Jeanne-Claude and her father went back to France and settled in Paris. People who knew the young artist from this early period of her life described her as rather gregarious and honest, with a surprisingly strong touch of her father's military personality. She dyed her hair red, had a problem with cigarettes and worked as an overseer responsible for supervising work crews. Jeanne-Claude met Christo in October 1958 when she was commissioned to paint a portrait of her mother. Although she was engaged to Philippe Planchon, Jeanne-Claude fell in love with the young portrait artist and got pregnant by Christo. Despite that fact, she still married Planchon, but left him right after the honeymoon was finished. Her family was rather displeased with this decision, particularly because of Christo's refugee status - they've even temporarily estranged themselves from their daughter. This all changed for the better as Christo and Jeanne-Claude's son, Cyril, was born on 11th of May, 1960.  During one of her numerous interviews, Jeanne-Claude stated that she became an artist only because Christo was himself in those waters and that she would take the path of a dentist if her chosen soulmate was of that profession. In fact, it was both of them that fell in love with creating art by making it alongside each other. In 1961, Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped barrels at the port of Cologne and this project stands as their very first mutual collaboration[2]. A year later, the couple presented their first iconic piece, titled as Rideau de Fer (Iron Curtain). Out of protest aimed against the Berlin Wall, Christo and Jeanne-Claude blocked off Rue Visconti, a small alley near the river Seine, with oil barrels. This demonstration made the young couple famous in Parisian neo avant-garde circles. Desiring new audiences and circumstances, Christo's rebellious spirit yet again spurred him and the duo decided to relocate. They've traveled across the Atlantic in 1964 and arrived in New York City. Although poor and lacking fluency in the English language, Christo managed to include his work in several galleries, including the well-known Castelli Gallery. Soon, the duo began to create storefronts and sell them in order to finance larger artistic projects.    Every single project on which Christo and Jeanne-Claude worked on since 1972 has been recorded by their friend photographer Wolfgang Volz[3]. Additionally, their works have also been the center point subjects for documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. During their forming years, the duo insisted that all of their projects be credited only to Christo - this was due to the couple's prejudices against female artists in the art world. This was the cause for many problems and issues between these artists and many other individuals who wanted to promote feminism within creative circles. Standing behind their decision, Jeanne-Claude once stated the following: The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately when we were young because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side. Subsequently, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to give the duo an upper hand and advance their success. The pair did not officially reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until the year of 1994. Christo and Jeanne-Claude's mature projects were greeted with much more success than their previous works. They liked to state that the goal of their art is achieving joy and beauty without inserting unnecessary political connotations - however, their work would often lead to responses associated with political and social states of our societies. Most of their projects were rooted in the 1962 project of blocking off the Rue Visconti in Paris. A year after they've successfully participated in the 1968's Documenta 4 in Kassel, Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped the coast of Little Bay, in Sydney, Australia, as a part of the Alcorso-Sekers Travelling Scholarship. More than one hundred laborers and 17,000 work hours were required in order to cover two and a half kilometers of coast and cliffs up to 26 meters in height with 95,600 m2 of synthetic fabric and over 56 km of rope - this was the largest single artwork ever made at this time and is a crucial piece in the history of Australia's modern art. A similar project was later performed in the Rocky Mountains near Rifle, Colorado (Valley Curtain, 1970) when a 400-meter-long cloth was stretched across a valley of Rifle Gap.  After Christo became a United States citizen in 1973, the duo launched arrangements for the Running Fence - a fabric barrier carried by steel posts and cables was to be run through the panorama and led into the sea. The fence was to be 5.5 meters high and 40 kilometers long. The project was a great success, but Christo had to pay a $60,000 fine because they did not have all the appropriate permissions. Inspired by the success of the Running Fence and spurred by the hefty sum of money fined, Christo and Jeanne-Claude started to take paid commissions. In addition, they continued to plan their future projects - like wrapping the Reichstag in Berlin and the Pont-Neuf in Paris, as well as covering footpaths in a Kansas City park (Wrapped Walk Ways). In the early 1980s, Jeanne-Claude wanted to surround eleven islands in Miami's Biscayne Bay with 603,850 m2 of pink polypropylene floating fabric. This enormous installation was completed on May 7, 1983, and was held in place for two weeks before it was taken down. As like all the other previous projects, the Surrounded Islands was completely financed by the actual artists themselves. On 3 January of 2005, work began on the installation of the couple's most protracted project - The Gates, Central Park, New York, 1979–2005. The Gates full name was intended to be a reference to the time that passed from their initial proposal until they were actualy able to go ahead with the project. A total of 7,503 gates made of saffron color fabric were placed on paths in Central Park. This project's price tag was around $21 million US dollars and it was crowned with the Doris C. Freedman Award for Public Art. Looking back at his life's work, Christo stated the following: Do you know that I don't have any works that exist? They all go away when they're finished. Only the preparatory drawings, and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain.    With their artistic and personal relationship lasting for over fifty years, the duo was forced to an end as Jeanne-Claude died at the age of 74[4], on November 18, 2009, as a result of complications behind a brain aneurysm. At the time of her death, she and Christo were planning a new project, titled as Over the River - they wanted to set their iconic fabric panels over the Arkansas River in Colorado. They also wanted to realize The Mastaba in which there were supposed to be 410,000 oil barrels configured as a trapezoidal prism. Although Christo never stopped being an active artist, his creative output was never the same again. Despite the rather sad ending of this incredible story that is now widely considered to be one of the most iconic tales in art history, a bright light of hope remains as the works of Jeanne-Claude Denat and Christo Vladimirov Javacheff have entered history despite their ungrateful temporary nature.  Christo died on May 31, 2020 in New York City, of natural causes. Per his wishes, the L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped project, delayed because of coronavirus, is still on track for September 18-October 3, 2021. These artists are represented by Galerie Thalberg Zurich, Puccio Fine Art, Galerie Fluegel-Roncak and Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art Miami. References:   ",853
Nick Gentry,"In the work of Nick Gentry the critique of consumerism, especially from the technological standpoint, represents the focal agenda. Therefore, the artist employs recycling as a starting working method in order to construct his peculiar compositions. A conversation between digital and analog processes, as well as the topics of identity and cyber culture, seems to be the central themes around which Gentry lead the general narrative behind his work. As a matter of fact, the haunting and eerie images are raising serious philosophical questions about the meaning of (human) life in the digital era where the distance between the man and the machine with each day seems to fade more and more.   Nicholas James Gentry was born in London, in London in 1980. He grew up in St Albans, a nearby town and attended Parmiter’s School in Garston and was almost expelled due to his troubling behavior. Later on, Gentry studied Sculpture in GCSE and at Ridge Street Art School and The University of Hertfordshire. The artist applied for Liverpool College of Art, but was refused and one year later his application was successful and he started attending the college. Gentry went on to become a successful graduate from Central Saint Martins in London in 2006.    Gentry is a collector of old floppy discs which are being donated to him for production.  The artist starts from the selection of labels on the discs which are suggesting what kind of information is stored on them. During the process, Gentry focuses on recycling obsolete media and the reuse of personal objects. Each floppy disk has a history of its own and represents the transformation of the modern life cycle, where objects are created, used and disposed of quicker than ever. Since these personal artifacts of life are cast aside and forgotten, they are given new life and a renewed purpose. So by employing discarded material, the artist documents historical media which once had a crucial role in modern technology and has outlasted its purpose.    In his portraits and installations, the human form is the means to explore the medium, not a subject in itself. Apparent fascination with the futuristic and cybernetic narrative makes the  art of Nick Gentry focused on the relationship of the humans to both man-made world and reality. That is related with the notions of life and death in regards to constant technological development. The human figure becomes a hybrid respectively cyborg, a bettered entity made out of human and machine. Yet, it seems as if those cyborgs got stuck in the void. The monochrome surface behind them undermines that actually (technological) consumerism implies nothingness and desperate attempt of adaptation.   The artist's floppy disc paintings present a series of Generation X portraits on canvases. They are made from used computer disks, with a metal hub which serves as the subject's deeply un-humanlike eye. The handwritten labels are just an addition to his haunting renderings, together with the disks' original blue, black, or gray color. These series represent Gentry's first venture into what has been called the social art. At the same time archaeological and evocative, the series turns form and function inside out. The whole idea of representing new and upgraded species reflects the real necessity of political and social transformation in order of achieving humanity betterment.   Again contributed entirely by members of the public, Gentry’s series of portraits made from used film negatives and X-rays call attention to a collective identity that has both emotional and biological perspectives. The selection process of negative is tone-based. Gentry layers the film to create the contrast and shape of the faces. The darker tones were made using X-rays, which can be seen in the hair section of the images, which are back lit with LED.   In 2015 Gentry was contacted by the Barbican Centre in London for commissioned work in order to raise funds for Cancer Research UK and to help complete the construction of the Francis Crick Institute. All along with the artists and designers including Ai Weiwei and Zaha Hadid, Gentry realized the work inspired by the structure of Nucleic acid double helix. Interestingly, in his early years, Gentry allegedly did several street art interventions. Along with street art stars such as  Banksy, Shepard Fairey, Blek le Rat, he is regarded as a part of London urban scene.    Before galleries started representing him, Gentry had a habit of leaving paintings in the streets, so that any passers-by could pick it up as a gift. The artist has been making a name for himself internationally by being featured in galleries and cities throughout the world since 2009. From that point, every year the number of group and solo exhibitions was only increasing. He has exhibited in the UK, USA, and many other cities worldwide. Finally, well-thought art practice of Nick Gentry is not only dealing with the exploration of how humankind is integrating with technology and critique of consumerist society, moreover, it questions the very evolution and the destiny of humans in accordance with the increasing exploitation of the natural resources in favor of technology.

Hans Hartung,"The astonishing artistic practice of Hans Hartung was largely framed by the agenda of rethinking and upgrading abstraction. Looking from a contemporary stance, the intensity and progressiveness of his innovative activity contributed to him being perceived as one of the major figures of post-war art. Led by the achievements of early modernist masters, Hartung pursued his further investigation of the painterly surface, the relations between the forms, and principles of harmony and proportion. Expressive and dramatic, his works were a direct reflection of his inner processes which were very much philosophically inclined.  Hans Hartung was born in 1904, in Leipzig. He grows up in the artistic family and in 1924 enrolled in Leipzig University, where he studied philosophy and art history. Despite being advised to pursue further training at the Bauhaus, he opted to study at the Kunstakademie, Dresden, where he copied the paintings of the old masters. The modern French and Spanish works he saw in 1926 at the Internationale Kunstausstellung in Dresden were a revelation to him, and he decided that he would leave his native country to prevent succumbing to provincialism. Consequently, after a bicycle trip through Italy, he moved to Paris.   During his stay in France, the artist visited the south, where the landscape inspired him to study the works of Cézanne, and he developed a great interest in the golden section. In 1928 he visited Munich where he studied painting technique with Max Doerner, and after a year Hartung married the artist Anna-Eva Bergman and established himself in the French towns of Leucate, and then in the Spanish Balearic Islands, eventually settling in Minorca. His art was considered to be degenerate by the Nazi’s and decided to leave the country with the help of his friend Christian Zervos.   After he returned to Paris as a refugee, Hartung and his wife divorced, and he became depressed. His paintings were becoming more abstract and did not sell well and the sculptor Julio González offered him the use of his studio. The same year, Hartung became a member of the French Foreign Legion. He was closely followed by the Gestapo and arrested for seven months by the French police. After they learned he was a painter, he was put in a red cell in an attempt to disturb his vision. After being released he rejoined the Legion to fight in North Africa, losing a leg in a battle near Belfort. He earned French citizenship in 1945 and was awarded the Croix de Guerre.   At the age of seventeen Hartung began to experiment with abstraction, synthesizing the graphic techniques of his artistic models while completely eliminating figurative elements. Before becoming fully dedicated to painting, the artist was very much hooked on philosophy, astronomy, music, and religion so it is no wonder that those references are interwoven in his work. Very often in his early stage, Hans Hartung found inspiration in the works of Rembrandt van Rijn and Francisco de Goya, and later influences included Lovis Corinth, Oskar Kokoschka, Emil Nolde, and Max Slevogt.    Soon after the artist showed his works for the first time in 1947, Hartung became one of the key figures in then sprawling Art Informel and Tachisme. His gestural, almost monochromatic paintings were characterized by configurations of long rhythmical brushstrokes or scratches. As the times passed by the calligraphic quality became his forte, but his work, in general, became less spontaneous and more formally aggressive. That was largely caused by the stroke Hartung had in 1986 after which he was bounded by a wheelchair. The new generation of artists of the ’60s was entranced by Hartung's freewheeling abstract paintings, so he is considered to be practically a predecessor of American Lyrical Abstraction of the 1960s and 1970s.    Through the years, Hans Hartung has received several international awards such as the 1956 award for the Europe-Africa section at the Guggenheim International Award and the International Grand Prize for painting at the 1960 Venice Biennale. A huge number of his works are on display in the world’s greatest museums and are held by collectors. The artist even appeared in in the 1963 film documentary School of Paris: (5 Artists at Work) by American filmmaker Warren Forma. Without any doubt. the great legacy of Hans Hartung is embedded in exploration and experimentation with various and unusual tools, immense imagination and constant drive for creation, which makes him one of the key art figures of the second half of the 20th century. Hans Hartung died on 7 December 1989, in Antibes, France. ",855
Mimmo Rotella,"Mimmo Rotella was an Italian artist best known for his “double décollages,”and was also a member of the French Nouveaux Réalistes group. Born in Catanzaro on October 7th 1918, Rotella studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Napes, and then moved to Rome in 1945. Also during this time, he developed “epistaltic” poetry, a combination of real and invented words, sounds, and onomatopoeic repetition. In 1951, he held his first solo exhibition at the Galleria Chiurazzi in Rome. That same year, he was awarded a Fulbright, and traveled to the United States, where he studied at Kansas City University. Rotella moved back to Rome in 1953, and began producing his first décollages, compositions made up of posters stripped off of outdoor walls in Rome. These posters were applied to canvas, and then further ripped apart. He began to receive acknowledgements in 1956 with the Graziano Award, followed in 1957 by the Battistoni e della Pubblica Istruzione Award. With the Cinecittà series of 1958 he chose both the figures and faces of film posters, orientating his production towards works of a more figurative type. Though initially abstract, after 1958, he created figurative décollage, and produced the Cinecittà series, using images from film posters. In 1961, he was invited by Pierre Restany to join the Nouveaux Réalistes group, and three years later, moved to Paris. In 1964, he was the Italian representative to the Venice Biennale. In the 1980s, Rotella settled in Milan and produced his blanks, in which he covered the ripped posters with monochrome sheets of paper. In 1984, he began painting, and produced the series Cinecittà 2 and Sovrapitture, in which he painted directly onto advertisements. He exhibited at the Centre Pompidou of Paris and at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, in 1990, and at the Guggenheim Museum in 1994. In 2000, the Foundation Mimmo Rotella opened, with the aim of promoting Contemporary Art and preserving the artist’s work. Rotella died in 2006 in Milan at the age of 87.   ",856
Jean Dubuffet,"Jean Dubuffet was a French painter and sculptor who can easily be described as a true enemy of everything traditional and orthodox art history has in its arsenal. His visionary approach to aesthetics embraced so called low art and shunned conventional standards of beauty in favor of what he believed to be more authentic and humanistic visuals. After over twenty years of occasional attempts at becoming an artist, Dubuffet eventually formed Art Brut - a modern movement that wanted to prove simplistic life and thought contained more creativity and poetry than any academic form ever invented[1]. Jean enjoyed a prolific art career, both in Europe and over the Atlantic, and was featured in many exhibitions throughout his lifetime.  Jean Philippe Arthur Dubuffet was born in Le Havre during the 31st July in 1901. He became a part of a family of wholesale wine merchants, which basically meant Jean did not have to worry about any form of financial hardships as he was growing up. After the First World War ended, Dubuffet moved to Paris with goals of studying painting at the Académie Julian and satisfying his rebellious spirit. He started to be a part of an elite artistic circle, which provided him with opportunities to meet and spend time with the likes of Juan Gris, André Masson and Fernand Léger. However, Jean started to feel rather unsatisfied with the way his university was organized after attending classes for six months, so he decided to leave the Académie and study autonomously. This departure will prove to be a key moment of Debuffet's mature career as it provided him with enough time and creative space to work on other interests, such as music, poetry and the study of ancient and modern languages, all of which will serve him good in the long run. Jean eventually strayed away from the artistic course and got married for the first time in 1925. He opened a small wine store in Paris and focused on expanding the family business. Dubuffet did start painting once again around the year of 1934 when he produced a series of portraits[2] in which he indicated some ignored vogues in art history. However, he stopped working on these projects during the early period of German occupation. As the Europe was being eaten up by the WWII blight, Dubuffet decided to devote himself again to painting. He would mostly focus on subjects and topics taken from everyday life around him, such as ordinary people sitting in the metro or taking a stroll down the countryside. Jean showed tendencies of painting with strong, unbroken colors during these early days - this way, he was able to pay his respects to the Fauvism movement and Die Brücke (The Bridge) painters which he held in high regard. His aesthetic was starting to show an important note - Dubuffet oftentimes placed his subjects in cramped spaces with goals of causing psychological reactions of viewers, ideally aiming for the feeling of claustrophobia. This third attempt at becoming an artist proved to be a successful one and Jean held his first solo show in October 1944, at the Galerie Rene Drouin in Paris. After the end of WWII, Dubuffet was strongly influenced by the work of Jean Fautrier - trying to somehow emulate his paintings, Jean started to utilize opaque oil paint incorporated with materials such as mud, sand, coal dust, pebbles, pieces of glass, string, straw, plaster, gravel, cement and tar. This kind of neo avant-garde approach allowed him to completely break the bonds of traditional art and lessons of Académie Julian. Furthermore, it led him to the discovery of a substitution for the regular paint brush. Dubuffet created a paste into which he could create physical marks, such as cuts and slash marks - the best evidence what results Jean's impasto technique had is the Hautes Pâtes (Thick Impastoes) series. In 1946, Dubuffet started a series of portraits which he painted in the same thick materials and in a manner carefully designed to be anti-psychological and anti-personal. This and his other lesser projects were crucified by the French critics and the public which accused Dubuffet of artistic anarchy.  Between the years of 1945 and 1947, Dubuffet took three separate trips to the French colony of Algeria seeking artistic inspiration. Fascinated by the local nomadic nature, Jean wanted to somehow channel that ephemeral quality of Algeria's existence through his aesthetics. These experiences eventually led Dubuffet to form La Compagnie de l'art brut in Paris, during 1948, alongside friends and colleagues such as Jean Paulhan, Andre Breton, Charles Ratton, Michel Tapie and Henri-Pierre Roche. This newly formed association was dedicated identification, documentation, and presentation of Art Brut pieces. Jean contributed with his own iconic collection, often times referred to as a museum without walls, making his favorite works of Aloïse Corbaz and Adolf Wölfli available to the public. These works aimed at transcending national and ethnic boundaries, effectively breaking down barriers between nationalities and cultures whilst focusing on ancient and primitive expressiveness. The term Art Brut was coined by Dubuffet and it literally meant raw art or outsider art - it was aimed at promoting non-professional pieces[3] created outside any and all aesthetic norms. This made the artworks of psychiatric patients, prisoners and children the focal point of Art Brut - as well as imitations of such pieces. Dubuffet tried to explain these notorious claims through writing his Prospectus aux amateurs de tout genre, in which he stated that one of his goals was to search for an art form in which everyone could participate and by which everyone could be entertained. He also promoted the resourceful exploitation of unorthodox materials within the process of creating pieces. In 1962, Dubuffet developed his famous Hourloupe style, producing works in polystyrene which he then painted with vinyl paint. Several of these large sculptures are among his most widely-known works today. Staying true to Art Brut for the remainder of his life, all of the mature pictures and sculptures Jean made looked very primitive and childlike. He continued to paint and draw throughout his declining health, working in Paris until his death in 1985.   After everything is said and done, it appears that Jean Dubuffet dedicated his life to fighting against intellectual terrorism[4] - a term him and French writer Jean Paulhan used as the World War II was slowly coming to an end. His radical struggle against traditional norms, incorporation of unorthodox materials, uncompromising concentration on neglected and downtrodden artists - these are some of the most crucial alterations contemporary period has to offer. Ultimately, Dubuffet’s foray into the unconventional paved the way for numerous creative free-thinkers emerging from the second half of the 20th century. This artist is represented by Allouche Gallery, Pace Gallery London, Pace Gallery Beijing, Pace Gallery Menlo Park, Pace Gallery Hong Kong and The Jane Kahan Gallery New York. References:   ",857
Friedel Dzubas,"A German-born American abstract painter, Friedel Dzubas was one of the pioneers of the stain painting technique alongside Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, and Kenneth Noland. Born 1915 in Berlin, Germany, Dzubas studied art in his native land before fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939 and settling in New York City. He came under the influence of Clement Greenberg in 1948 after responding to an ad Greenberg placed in the Partisan Review for summer lodging, with whom he remained close friends over subsequent decades. While sharing a studio with fellow abstract painter Helen Frankenthaler in the early 1950s, he produced his most important and best-remembered works characterized by flat swaths of bold colors butting up against one other. Dzubas' monumental luminous works reveal his mastery of color, light and scale. During the 1960s, he became associated with Color field painting and Lyrical Abstraction, creating more fluid work. He used Magna paint an oil based acrylic paint, applying thick layers of color over washes, scrubbing the paint into the unprimed canvas. Throughout the sixties and seventies, he was honored with several prestigious teaching appointments and grants, including two Guggenheim fellowships, a National Endowment for the Arts Painting Fellowship, and Artist-in-Residence appointments at the Institute for Humanistic Studies in Aspen, Dartmouth College, and Cornell University.

John Sonsini,"An American painter working with oils, John Sonsini is best known for his portraits of Latino laborers, at once highly personal depictions and references to the politics of immigration. His all-male portraits generally address broad issues of gender mythology. Born in Rome, New York, Sonsini currently lives and works in Los Angeles. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975 from California State University, Northridge, CA. He has exhibited his works in venues such as Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, Los Angeles, CA; Miles McEnery Gallery, New York, NY; Art Design & Architecture Museum, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA; Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, CA; Patrick Painter Gallery, Los Angeles, CA; Bentley Gallery, Phoenix, AZ; Kucera Gallery, Seattle, WA; Inman Gallery, Houston, TX; James Kelly Contemporary, Santa Fe, NM; Hamilton College, Emerson Gallery, Clinton, NY; and ACME., Los Angeles, CA. Sonsini creates his work in several five-hour-long sessions with his sitters in his studio. In this way, he removes his subjects from their day to day contexts, setting them against tonal backdrops devoid of detail. His works are occasionally populated with items such as suitcases, bags, and boxes, suggesting a story.",863
Xavier Veilhan,"A French contemporary artist, Xavier Veilhan has a multi-faceted practice, encompassing photography, sculpture, film, painting and installation art, as well as hybrids of all of these. In addition, he also works with performance and filmmaking. Born in 1963 in Lyon, Veilhan currently lives and works in Paris. After graduating from the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs in Paris, Xavier Veilhan continues his formation in Berlin at the Hochschule der Künste, in the atelier of artist Georg Baselitz. He returns to Paris to finish his studies in 1989 at the Institut des hautes Etudes en Arts plastiques. Veilhan's work is defined by the artist's interest in both the vocabulary of modernity and classical statuary. Using a formal artistic language that combines the codes of both industry and art, he pays tribute to the inventions and inventors of modernity. He is best known for the series of sculptures titled Architectones, where he pays tribute to Malevich's Architectons, three-dimensional models that blend architecture with philosophy. These works, each unique and in dialogue with its settings, were installed in celebrated, modernist homes. At once ambivalent and stark, Veilhan's works address issues of perception as well as the physical and temporal relationships created within the context of the exhibition format. ",864

Arthur Dorval,"Arthur Dorval is a prominent French painter. His take on geometric images is what made him famous worldwide, and he is one of the most promising young artists in France. Born in 1987 in Lille, France, Dorval showed an early interest in drawing, having accompanied his gallerist father on visits to museums, galleries, and artists’ workshops. He began his academic training at Saint-Luc Toumai, where he majored in Illustration, and subsequently studied Design at La Cambre in Brussels. Dorval is a part of the pure Geometric Abstraction movement, alongside such artists as Alberto Magnelli, Auguste Herbin and Victor Vasarely. The movement was started at the beginning of the 20th century, but has since evolved, a fact that is evident in the work of Dorval. The play of shapes and colors gives his pieces movement and vibrancy, making them seem more as architectural feats than paintings. It is his signature work on color, as well, that gives a feel of full color or transparency characteristic of his work. He gained renown with his first series of works – Geometric Hatching in 2010. This was soon followed by his second series, Composition No.2. Dorval’s artworks have been displayed in galleries across France. He is represented by the David Bloch Gallery from Marrakech, Morocco.

L'Outsider," L'Outsider is a French artist whose work can be described as abstraction deeply influenced by typography and graffiti movement.  His works, which grace the walls of many cities, explore various themes, such as vehicles, onomatopoeia, flags or animal spots. Some of his artworks are inspired by South African Ndebele art. L‘Outsider exhibited his gallery works in Slika Gallery in Lyon, France in 2014, and La Grille in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland in 2013.   In 2015, L'Outsider took a radical artistic turn. The color and lettering gradually disappears from his compositions, revealing a painting synthesized in abstraction and close to constructivism where the observer can see emerging metaphysical questions.

Marc C. Woehr,"It isn’t always easy for young artists to work on the streets, especially if they’re just starting. They aren’t quite sure what they want to paint and who they are. There is one thing, though, that all of them have in common – the need to create and leave their mark on the walls, to let the world know they exist. Marc C. Woehr began his artistic journey with the same goals, conquering the popular places with his artworks. But, people change over years, they evolve and become interested in new things, and so did Woehr, replacing the street world with a bit quieter indoor work, and walls with canvases. In the recent years, his turned his attention to the wood reliefs, which he has been creating since 2013.  In the beginning, Woehr’s work included somewhat simple lettering, which soon evolved into large images, often several meters wide. Even though his skills have drastically improved, he felt that working in the streets isn’t really sufficient. Following the need to increase the composition in his art, he made a quick decision to replace the walls with a studio. The collage was his chosen medium at the time, expressing the artist’s preoccupation with urban space. They were composed out of photographs and newspapers cut-outs combined with painted elements and were similar to Bauhaus and DADA movement of the 1920’s. Recently, he’s made a transition into creating wood reliefs. Inspired by the work of Vladimir Tatlin, Kazimir Malevich, and El Lissitzky, Woehr began exploring what lies beyond the borders of the canvas. His pieces transform the 2D images into fragile, multi-layered wood reliefs, developed firstly on a computer and then cut out by laser.   Woehr was born in Heilbronn, grew up in Neckarsulm and has spent short periods of time in Mainz and Mannheim before finally moving to Stuttgart in 2001. The artist thinks that the city’s size is just right, not too big and certainly not too small. It offers a significant amount of culture, greenery, and beautiful lookouts. He usually uses white, gray, black and red, but states that orange is his favorite color. In the world where our lives are often met with challenges we can’t always control, the art, and painting especially, are a way out for Woehr. Art is sort of an escape, a door which leads into a more peaceful world where he can pursue and do what he wants.   It is important to follow your dreams, even if they mean moving away from the past ones. Marc C. Woehr began on the streets but moved on to the studio work. No matter what he does, paper or wood, acrylic, charcoal, even spray paint – all of it simply exudes control, the one thing he couldn’t quite have while he worked on the streets. In the process of creation, the artist relies mostly on intuition, giving his pieces a surprising level of heterogeneity.  ",870
Anna Maria Maiolino,"Anna Maria Maiolino is an Italian-Brazilian artist who makes books, video art, sculptures, and drawings. She explores the human rights and social aspects of immigration politics in Brazil through her performance art and conceptual installations. She is regarded as one of the most significant artists working in Brazil today. Born in 1942 in Scalea, in Calabria in southern Italy to an Italian father and Ecuadorian mother, Maiolino emigrated with her family to Venezuela in 1954, where she later attended Escola Nacional Cristobal Rojas in 1958. In 1960, she and her family moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she attended painting and woodcut courses at Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. This is where she met artists Antonio Dias and Rubens Gerchman, with whom she would later participate in the early Brazilian art movements. At the age of 18, she became involved in the early Brazilian art movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including the New Configuration, Neo-Concretism, and the New Brazilian Objectivity movement in 1967, which shifted the nature of Brazilian art. While being involved with the Brazilian Objectivity movement, she worked with many respected Brazilian artists, including Lygia Clark and Lygia Pape. She now lives and works in São Paulo, Brazil. Working across a wide range of disciplines and mediums, spanning drawing, printmaking, poetry, film, performance, installation and sculpture, Maiolino relentlessly explores notions of subjectivity and self and expresses a concern with creative and destructive processes. Rich with metaphor, her works question language, sexuality, desire and the unconscious. ",871

Helio Oiticica,"A Brazilian visual artist, sculptor, painter, performance artist, and theorist, best known for his participation in the Neo-Concrete Movement, Hélio Oiticica is best known for his participation in the Neo-Concrete Movement, his innovative use of color and his environmental art. His work ranges from abstract geometric paintings to large-scale site specific works. Born in 1937 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Oiticica and his brothers were taught at home until their father got a fellowship at the Guggenheim Foundation when they moved to Washington, D.C. The family returned to Brazil in 1950, and in 1954, at the age of 16, Oiticica attended courses at Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, studying under Ivan Serpa. In 1955, he joined Grupo Frente. In 1959, he became involved in the short-lived but influential Neo-Concrete Movement, which rejected the objective nature of Concrete Art and sought to use phenomenology to create art that ""expresses complex human realities."" Greatly influenced by European modern art movements, principally Concrete art and De Stijl, Oiticica's early works used a palette of strong, bright primary and secondary colors and geometric shapes. Soon his color palette gave way to a more subtle palette of oranges, yellows, reds and browns which he maintained for the rest of his life. During his Neo-Concrete period, he painted monochromes entitled Invencoes (Inventions) in which the artist sought to embody light.

Ivan Argote,"A Paris-based Colombian artist, Iván Argote is known for works created in a wide range of media including films, sculptures, collages, and public space installations. He is probably best known for filming himself while spray-painting over a work by Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, protected by glass. Born in Bogotá in 1983, Argote currently lives and works in Paris. He studied Graphic design at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá and further specialized in new medias and photography. He earned his MFA from École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris - ENSBA, Paris in 2008. His solo exhibitions include those at the Arizona State University Art Museum, Tempe (AZ), MALBA, Buenos Aires, Perrotin, Paris and New York, Museo Universitario del Chopo, Mexico, Galeria Vermelho, Sao Paulo, Proyecto Amil, Lima, SPACE, London, Galeria ADN, Barcelona, and DT Project, Brussels, among others. Exploring the relationship in between history, politics and the construction of our own subjectivities, he creates works which seek to generate questions about how we relate to the others, to the state, to patrimony and traditions. He is celebrated for bold interventions into public spaces and audacious appropriations of art history. As he once explained, his works are reflections about the way we behave, “about how we understand our close environment, and about how this close environment is related with history, traditions, art, politics, and power.”",878
Deanna Sirlin,"Deanna Sirlin is an American abstract artist best known for her gestural paintings and monumental installations. Her work prioritizes color. In her paintings, she explores how texture and composition affect color relationships. Through her installations, she dramatically alters physical environments, using color and light to challenge how viewers interact with space. A native New Yorker, Sirlin began her art education at age six at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, now part of the Pratt Institute. She earned her B.A.in Art in 1978 from the State University of New York at Albany (SUNY), and her M.F.A. in Painting in 1980 from Queens College. Sirlin is a Yaddo Fellow, and in 2016 was the Rothko Foundation International Painting Symposium Artist in Residence.  Though primarily a painter, Sirlin adopts any medium that allows her to explore the relationships color has with form, composition and the physical environment. Her acrylic paintings exude a multitude of layers, building to vibrant, complex, textural surfaces. Her process sometimes involves manipulating the surface, allowing natural forces like gravity to affect the paint. Action is important to her mark making. Her brush is an extension of her body. The fluid brushstrokes are often the first elements of her paintings to catch the eye. Sirlin also works in collage and sculpture, creates public murals, writes extensively about art, and has adapted her imagery by using digital technology to create monumental works embedded in glass for windows, covering buildings in the United States, and Italy.  Sirlin has said, “I think in terms of color, density, and the movement of stroke and light.” She endeavors to make work that reflects the way she likes to live. She infuses her work with a search for positivity and lust for life, and has described her paintings as having a particular “pleasure of being.” She is inspired by opportunities to translate her work into new mediums and new environments. Her paintings helped inspire her large-scale installations. In turn, the ways light and space interplay with the work on those projects inspires the way she engages with paint. Digital technology also affects the way she approaches her work. In an interview with Quanda Rodriguez for Catalyst magazine, Sirlin said,   Work by Deanna Sirlin has been shown in solo and group exhibitions throughout the United States, as well as in France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Turkey, Latvia, and China. Works by Sirlin are included in numerous institutional and private collections, including that of the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia, the Mark Rothko Centre in Daugavpils, Latvia, the Shenzhen Institute of Fine Arts in Shenzhen, China,  Kunsthaus Nurnberg, Germany, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Georgia.

Kim Uchiyama,"Kim Uchiyama is an American abstract artist whose works use color to create light and form which activate the metaphysical potential of pictorial space. Uchiyama studied art and literature at Drake University in Des Moines, IA and pre-Renaissance art history in Florence, Italy. She has studied art at Yale’s Summer School of Art & Music, Queens College and the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. Her fellowships include the New York Foundation for the Arts, the MacDowell Colony, Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, Auvillar, France and BAU Institute, Otranto, Italy. She is a member of American Abstract Artists.  Uchiyama’s watercolors convey brimming bands of enigmatic light. She employs saturated color to establish an overarching chorus, each band delineating its unique voice. The precise arrangement, like notes of a song, transfers energy from one moment to the next.  Uchiyama works with watercolor on Arches paper and oil paint on canvas and linen. She develops multiple images simultaneously. To begin each work, she waits to “see” an initial color on the blank surface before applying it to her ground. Each consecutive color builds on that original impulse to create a grid comprised of color shapes. Each layer possesses unique physical and material properties: some are opaque; others translucent; some are painterly; others flat. Each choice the artist makes serves to create a dynamic, multi-faceted composition that invites the viewer’s eye to move along with her and experience the way the painting was made.  One of Uchiyama’s inspirations was her teacher, the painter Nicolas Carone, who had himself studied with Modernist master Hans Hofmann. Uchiyama shares the emphasis that Carone and Hofmann placed on color, pictorial space and the architecture of painting. She mobilizes these elements in her compositions to create a singular tension, harmony and rhythm. Uchiyama is frequently inspired by the light and atmosphere of a specific place or landscape encountered in her travels. She uses color to communicate an emotive essence or feeling of that place - its light and shadow, its weight. Art critic Michelle Aldredge says: Patient, attentive viewers will find a lot to enjoy in Uchiyama’s paintings. Layers bubble beneath layers, colors recede or emerge from the canvas. Music is a useful parallel, since Uchiyama creates variations on a theme, much like a composer or jazz musician would–texture, rhythm, timbre, and harmony are integral to each piece.

Faile,"FAILE is an artistic collaboration between Patrick McNeil  and Patrick Miller, known for a wide ranging multimedia practice recognizable for its explorations of duality through a fragmented style of appropriation and collage. Patrick Miller and Patrick McNeill, two close collaborators grew up together in Arizona, USA during the 1970s. They began working together in New York in the late 1990s. Aiko Nakagawa, an early collaborator, left to pursue her own career under the name Lady Aiko in 2006. From their beginnings stenciling and wheat-pasting collages made from pulp imagery, including fliers for underground music acts and specialist prostitutes, to their incredibly successful print editions inspired by comic book culture, to the ambitious architectural works such as The FAILE Temple and giant sculpture The Wolf Within, FAILE have constantly evolved their unique artistic style. The forms of expression they chose seem contradictory – arcade machines and traditional American quilts for example. But they are a reminder that progressive subcultures like urban art often spotlight that which can be found lacking in mainstream thinking. While painting and printmaking remain central to their approach, over the past decade FAILE has adapted its signature mass culture-driven iconography to vast array of materials and techniques, from wooden boxes and window pallets to more traditional canvas, prints, sculptures, stencils, installation, and prayer wheels. FAILE's work is constructed from found visual imagery, and blurs the line between “high” and “low” culture, but recent exhibitions demonstrate an emphasis on audience participation, a critique of consumerism, and the incorporation of religious media, architecture, and site-specific/archival research into their work. The duo made a smooth transition from street activity to gallery pieces when they began exhibiting in the early 2000s. These shows featured large format, limited edition works on paper and board, plus physical items such as ""FAILE boxes"", which resemble chests for personal keepsakes. The two-dimensional pieces at first followed the collage format of their street work, but soon evolved into mini-narratives taking the form of imaginary comic book covers. These compositions are produced to such a professional level that one is left wondering if they are original or appropriated. Often they contain considerable hand finishing, and due to handling during the process often appear ""worn"" or ""vintage"" in feel. Besides a voracious market in limited edition works on paper and imaginative sculptural works, FAILE's career since those first gallery shows has been characterised by a number of impressive large-scale installations. FAILE's art reaches beyond the urban art niche to touch a generation. The duo's work uses imagery associated with popular culture to examine complex, and often neglected, metaphysical issues facing the artists' epoch. They live in Brooklyn.",885
Augustine Kofie,"Augustine Kofie, aka KofieOne, is an American artist Inspired by the basic building blocks of the geometric world. He has formed a retro-futuristic aesthetic which transplants these shapes and angles into a soulful, organic, yet highly mathematical form of abstraction.  Born and raised in Los Angeles, Kofie’s instinct to draw was cultivated through the creativity of his mother. Whilst she was studying fine arts at UCLA, Kofie was using the supplies that lay around his house to start experimenting on his own, he starting to excel in drawing by the time he had reached middle school. Whilst his art education never went further than high school, Kofie’s real training was garnered through his time spent painting graffiti, he coming to prominence in the Los Angeles graffiti scene by the mid 1990s. Many of his murals and productions are still on view. Giving him an extensive understanding of both “color and layering, points of perspective and arrangement”, graffiti not only gave Kofie his technical foundation however, it also provided the underpinning for his love of construction and form: Through drafting and sketching wildstyle pieces, “stretching the letters out and rebuilding them, giving them varied points of perspective and basically building shapes out”, Kofie began to understand the architectural basis of writing, an understanding pushing him to focus on the linear rather than alphabetic aspects of his work. Having also felt that he had made an honest contribution to the LA graffiti scene, Kofie’s evolutionary drive meant he soon began to “distort and manipulate” his work, attempting to “re-contribute and redistribute something new”. Kofie plays with form and line, with balance and depth, twisting and manipulating his murals, his illustrations, his compositions, into ever new and dramatic arrangements.  He is primarily self-taught. With a deep interest in process and structure, Augustine Kofie creates works of intense detail centered on the order of balance. The precision of Kofie’s “drafted” art is strongly inspired by modern architecture as well as the form and shape of typography. In his quest for balance, Kofie harmonizes opposing and contradictory dynamics in his work by setting futuristic compositions against vintage earth-toned palettes, and creating organically complex formations through meticulously structured line-work and layering. His intense skill and technique reflect certain reliance upon structure in the creative process. His collages and assemblages consist of many layers—a mix of intentional and unintentional order. There is a distinct contrast between his mechanic line work, and organic structures, all of which culminating in a heavy earth-toned and a multi-layered not subject to gravity. Kofie aims to create images that leap off the canvas at the viewer but at the same time invite him to join a conversation.  His work reflects his wide range of interests: architectural templates, deconstructed lettering, vintage collage paper, contemporary music, and 1960’s-70′s iconography. Recently Kofie became a member of the Agents of Change, a tight crew of progressive graffiti artists, which also includes Jaybo Monk and Derm from this exhibition as well. He also is a member of the Transcend Collective with Joker, Poesia and more. With a deep interest in process and structure, Kofie creates works of intense detail centered on the order of balance. The precision of Kofie’s “drafted” art is strongly inspired by modern architecture as well as the form and shape of deconstructed typography. Augustine Kofie, aka KofieOne, lives in Los Angeles.",886
PEETA,"Manuel di Rita, better known as Peeta, took on an endeavor to break the generic typographical form of letters, by stylizing them with shape and volume, rendering more than just their mere semantic function. His main inspiration is letters forming his own moniker. As language is an alive form of communication, never still, always fluctuating and evolve with people, Peeta brings his lettering into the fluidity of the urban environment. Here, words are ruptured from their histories, readapted and reformed. This change of history of a letter is transposed to the fusion between traditional lettering and three-dimensional style that gives this artist a unique style and a kind of visual rhythm.   It is inevitable for the artist to convey his own personality through his work. In the case of Peeta, this happens through his work with a three-dimensional painting that hides a spiritual side of the artist. In the midst of technical and formal perfection, lay shades of color and perceptive tricks. The latter being an essential part of a progressive disclosure of the artist’s own personality, implicitly mediating his own will to understand and describe his ego.    The artist plays with the letters of his moniker, as an attempt of making a self-portrait. His plays with perspective and concept of dimension aim at revealing the deceptiveness of human perception. Shifting fixed points of view with visual tricks serves to emphasize the fallacy of the human perception of the world, in an attempt to grant a three-dimensional semblance on a pictorial representation, ultimately revealing the will to deceive.    Peeta has been a graffiti artist since 1993, and he is a member of the EAD crew in Padova, Italy, FX and RWK crews in New York City. He has participated in graffiti jams and Meeting of Styles events across Europe and the Americas. The Italian artist isn’t just a graffiti artist, but also a sculptor, as his pieces explore the potential of sculptural lettering, similar to his street art and paintings.His PVC sculptures start as a 3D design in a software that allows him to have a three-dimensional view of the sculpture and virtually cut out all the surfaces as he considers his pieces on a 2D plane. Peeta also explores his field of interest on canvas.   Perfectly understanding shapes and size of any material of his choice, thanks to the 3D program, Peeta builds his sculptures. He cuts the PVC plates and assembles them together, coating the surface of the sculpture with a polyester layer. This allows him to mask the imperfections resulted from the building process, and also to allow singularity to the structure. Besides the PVC, Peeta has acrylic resin and fiberglass sculptures as well as bronze, which are created using investment casting technique.    ",887
Ben Frost,"As a post-modern pop artist, Ben Frost uses all the tricks and techniques of the advertising industry. By using the symbols and icons of the media moguls and recalibrating them anew, he actually turns them against the propaganda industry. Frost’s pieces distort logos, icons and characters from popular culture as he re-makes them in startling and often confronting new ways; Disney characters, Hello Kitty, the Simpsons, Lego, Powerpuff girls and Pokémon. He subverts the iconography from the areas of politics, entertainment, and commercialism, creating a unique and bold visual language that confronts the viewers and often stirs up a lot of controversy along the way.  Born in Brisbane, Australia, he faked his own death in 2000 for an exhibition suitably titled Ben Frost is Dead which made national news in Australia. Invitations were created in the form of a newspaper funeral notice and distributed nation-wide. Labeled by newspapers as perverse and sick, there was a misfortune in the form of time-related coincidence, as a local art patron died on the very same day when the invitations went out. Frost’s work was featured in numerous magazines and newspapers, including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, FHM, and HQ. In 2003 he moved to Tokyo, where he contributed as an illustrator to magazines such as Black + White, Blue, and Men’s Style for more than 3 years. Upon his return to Sydney, he started an online store where he could sell his works and blog portal “Stupid Krap”, which continues to support and represent a number of notable Australian emerging artists including Anthony Lister, Numskull, Beastman, Kareena Zerefos, E.L.K, Mark Drew, HA-HA, Kill Pixie, and Bridge Stehli. Stupid Krap is currently located in a two-level warehouse in Annandale, which also incorporates Stupid Krap Studios – a multi-disciplinary collective consisting of ten established and emerging artists.   Asked to compare cartoon characters and consumerist merchandise, Frost thinks “they are the same really. If you put big eyes and a toothless grin onto something, then it seems it will sell better. I was always very frightened of Ronald McDonald as a child.”[1] He makes art from the things around him, and with commercialism and entertainment being so pervasive in today’s environment, it seemed like an obvious choice. He has extended his practice by starting the package painting (acrylic painting onto the surface of packages and boxes that he finds on his travels). According to Frost, he gathers the objects from different sources, either directly off the shelves of supermarkets, friends who are in the medical industry, trash cans and from people who actually use the various medicines that are inside the boxes. Since he began package painting by using acrylic back in 2011, “the branding and product titles seem to be more obvious in their possible double meanings. Twinkies, Hamburger Helper, Vanilla Cupcakes, Dirty Rice, Cheese Nips and Hot Tamales have all suggested new and twisted re-imaginings.” The ads can be extremely jarring and they aren’t always the most aesthetic thing to put into an artwork for visual consumption, so he spends a lot of time on the process and how different juxtapositions work together to make the most relevant and appealing results that he can.   His painting White Children Playing caused a stir for its graphic depiction of children using drugs and a masked and disgruntled assailant slashed one of the paintings in his exhibition at the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane. Police also tried to remove one of his collaborative artworks in an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney because of its graphic nature. He also started the yearly paste-up festival Paste-Modernism, which is the largest of its kind in the world. Essentially, Frost thinks that “art is about creating a dialogue, pushing boundaries and constantly evolving the whole medium.” Surely, negative responses happen all the time, but there are far more positive reactions from the viewers who are able to recognize the significance of his work. He is represented by No Walls Gallery and Vertical Gallery.  References:  ",888
Remed,"There isn’t some kind of special motivation for making art. Instead, the drive to create is present within each and every one of us. It’s only a matter of choice if we follow it. Alby Guillaume aka Remed is a French artist who plunged himself into the world of art without any kind of formal training, but that didn’t limit him in any way. Characterizing his work as mix between mathematics and soul, he seeks precision and always listens his gut feeling. Simplifying things is one way to make them universal. Sometimes the artist succeeds, sometimes not, but all the pieces possess a level of sincerity that makes them appealing to the viewers. Well, their imposing visual qualities also help in a great deal.  Influenced by Picasso, Léger, Matisse, Modigliani, Miró, but also Typography, Asian Calligraphy and Art Brut, Remed creates pieces that are colorfully challenging and yet accurate, without being overwhelming. He takes styles well past their due date, and revitalizes them, making them contemporary and giving them a feeling of freshness. The idea behind his work is for people to be able to recognize themselves in his art, that’s why he’s trying to make his pieces as universal as possible. Life itself is where the most of the inspiration comes from. By using what he feels, what he lives through, the artist is telling his story, hoping that the viewers will recognize some of their own life cycles within his ones.   There are three events that shaped his career, and life, consequently. He was really moved when he saw a book about Modigliani; the second one happened in Tourcoing in northern France, while Remed was living and studying in Lille. He entered the house of Madjoub Ben Bella, a wondrous honest abstract calligraphy artist and was amazed with the artworks. A few years later, Guillaume invited Nadjib Ben Bella, Madjoub’s son, to come with him to Marrakesh. There, while chatting about life, as Nadjib reminded him that his father is an artist, Remed understood it’s also possible for him to become one. The third and the one that probably cemented his decision to be an artist happened in Marrakesh when his friend asked him what he wants to do in his life. He discovered painting at the age of 17 in an atelier of his home town, Lille, where he enjoyed the privacy and quietness of the studio. But, over time, the need to surpass the limitations of a canvas and framework, so we roamed into the streets where he feels most comfortable. Despite of the shift of focus towards writing graffiti and creating large-scale murals, Remed continues to paint as well.    Color, shape, and sound are rhymed to express emotions, feelings, the constant evolution of thoughts. Creating art for Remed is similar to writing a diary, an honest blend of soul and science, with accuracy, logic, transmutations and rhythm being of equal importance for the both fields. ‘’I live what I feel, I paint what I live.’’ And that’s why, in these days where everything can be sold and much revolves around marketing and money, Remed hasn’t forgotten why he paints. He is represented by Adda Gallery and David Bloch Gallery.  ",889
Jasper Johns,"One of the most famous statements concerning modern art phenomenon that happened during the 20th century is the following declaration Jasper Johns said during the 1970s: To be an artist you have to give up everything, including the desire to be a good artist. Over the course of his career that lasted for over 50 years, Johns has been creating pieces of art based solely on his own concepts and principles, eventually establishing his own style. Jasper’s works were so ahead of his time that it took some patience for the world to be fully ready for his ideas - fortunately, Johns in now considered to be one of the key figures of modern art and his creations have been credited with making a crucial impact on later movements of Pop art and Minimalism. Working in a variety of techniques from encaustic to printmaking, this is a story about an artist that was not afraid to experiment, innovate and stand behind his unique concepts.  Jasper Johns was born in Georgia on May 15, 1930, and grew up amidst subtropical beaches and marshlike sea islands of South Carolina. When Johns was a mere toddler, his parents decided to call it quits and divorce each other, subsequently sending young Jasper to live with his grandfather. The sudden shift of scenery and frightening changes would take their toll on every child and Johns was no exception - the earliest years of his life were marked by traumatic events and feelings of abandonment. His beloved grandfather died when Johns was a little over nine years of age after which he spent a short period of time with his remarried mother and her new family. This was just another uncomfortable change for the small child and after everyone realized things were not working out as hoped, Jasper was yet again sent off to live with someone else - this time, his next destination was the house of his aunt. Besides a couple of years Johns spent rejoined with his mother, the young artist was usually settled at his aunt for the duration of high school. Arguably the most interesting thing about Johns's grim childhood is the fact it included very little exposure to art, yet Jasper perpetually talked about how one day he will be a successful artist, knowing deep in his soul that there was no other outcome for his life story. In an attempt to somehow put the wheels of his goals in motion, Johns started attending classes at the University of South Carolina, where he studied for three full semesters prior to the decision of leaving home and setting sails for the lights of New York City. After Jasper Johns managed to somehow reach the city lights of the Big Apple, he soon became a student at the Parsons School of Design. He was quite comfortable there and was showing remarkable progress and potential, but unfortunately, he was forced to quit the studies due to a lack of funds. This broke Jasper's heart, but there was no going around it. Then came the year of 1951, which will prove to have even more misfortune for the young Johns who was still searching for his place in the world - he was drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War. Fortunately, the luck was starting to show the other cheek for Jasper as he was placed nowhere near Korea - he was actually stationed in the city where he spent his childhood, South Carolina! Afterward, Johns was sent to a barracks in Sendai, Japan. Here, far away from any real combat, young Jasper got an opportunity to aquent himself with the customs and traditions of the Far East, instantly falling in love with both the culture and art located in The Land of the Rising Sun. After initial depression and issues with adjusting to the ways of a soldier, Johns finally felt that old familiar urge in his soul as it was again whispering artistic ideas in his ear. The time he spent in Japan was crucial for the development of his entire personality and had a massive impact on the way Jasper would artistically express himself in the future.    After Jasper Johns finally left the army in the year of 1953, the creatively refreshed artist yet again set his sails for the New York City - only this time around, he was armed with the knowledge and inspiration that came from the exposure to Japanese traditional art. Soon after his arrival, Johns befriended a fellow artist Robert Rauschenberg - the duo had huge ambitions and started off by designing windows for all sorts of clientele, namely for stores like Tiffany's. The Rauschenberg-Johns team added new members to its arsenal after a while, as the avant-garde composer John Cage and a choreographer Merce Cunningham joined and reinforced the artistic pair.  By his own acclaim, Jasper had a dream during the year of 1954 which can be defined as  a vision of a sort - he dreamed that he was painting an American flag. Subsequently, this inspired him to create The Flag, a painting in encaustic - this classical technique has its roots in ancient Egypt and it is based on mixing pigments with melted wax. As a sign of a creative rebirth, Jasper Johns actually destroyed all of the art he'd produced before The Flag came to be, explaining that: all of the previous pieces were done with the spirit that I wanted to be an artist, not that I was an artist. Prior to that moment, Johns was already getting attention, but now he was starting to develop a reputation as an exciting and uncompromising artist. One day, an art dealer Leo Castelli happened to spot his paintings while visiting Rauschenberg's home - impressed by the originality of the pieces Robert managed to save from Johns’ fix ideas of burning his own work, Castelli started following and exploring Jasper’s newer works. Soon afterward, the dealer invited Johns to have a solo exhibition at his gallery. This 1958 showing was a success, with the director of the Museum of Modern Art purchasing three of Johns's paintings and consequently transforming Jasper into a rising star of the art scene.    The Flag was just one example of a ready-made note Johns had an affinity for - taking a commonly seen object and displaying it in a new context, similar to the way Marcel Duchamp created the famous Fountain. Besides the transformation of the American flag, Jasper also worked with images of targets, numbers, letters and maps. This was an incredible moment in originality as the art scene of the time did not have anything to rival against Johns and his concepts. From today’s standpoint, it seems as though Jasper disrupted the dominance of Abstract Expressionism and in many ways paved the way for new movements, setting the stage for both Pop Art and Minimalism. Without any warning, Jasper Johns suddenly took a turn for full abstraction during the 1970s when he started using cross-hatched patterns in numerous works. By the end of the decade, he would settle with a nice balance of abstraction and figuration, with the pieces like Cicada that had a fine blend of cross-hatching and a cicada. As he was growing older, Jasper also began inserting subtle autobiographical touches and nods inside his compositions, highlighting his own pieces and showing an interesting awareness of his personal development. Throughout his art, Jasper Johns had one particular concept he never betrayed and has stayed true for the entirety of his career - he would never try to convey a specific message by channeling it within his art. He always preferred the idea in which the audience was responsible for interpreting his work, subsequently leading it down the path of personal meanings and messages. This kind of an approach may seem a bit trivial these days, but when you turn the clock for the 70s, it becomes a truly original concept. Besides painting and partial ready-mades, Jasper has also worked in sculpture, drawing and printmaking - but no matter what material was used as a mean to a goal, Johns always focused more on the process of creating, claiming this was the actual art instead of the final result. His art may have been nailed and criticized on many occasions, but he always knew how to handle it and it seem as he was constantly able to spin the circumstances into his own favor. It should also be noted that Johns has collaborated with numerous crucial figures from the art world, working alongside such names as Andy Warhol and Samuel Beckett. However, it should also be stated that the friendship he had with Robert Rauschenberg suddenly came to an end in 1961, though the specific details behind their separation remained unknown. Always a popular and influential individual, Johns has been rewarded for his work on many times - amongst his most prestigious recognitions, Jasper has been awarded the Grand Prize at the Venice Biennale during the year of 1988.    It is impressive how Jasper Johns has managed to stay confident and convinced in his concepts throughout his career that was full of doubters and experts that were hell bent on criticizing his artwork. Despite varied opinions, Johns never lost popularity amongst the viewers as his exhibitions have never failed to attract visitors and his pieces stand as some of the most expensive works ever sold. When the art world was desperately searching for new ideas, Johns stood up and ventured outside the comfort of the established abstract style, introducing his flags and maps that ultimately altered the course of modern art history. Shortly put, Jasper is unquestionably one of the key figures in any conversation concerning novelties brought by contemporary art.

Sol LeWitt,"Being one of the main figures in the creation of the new aesthetic of the 60’s that was in a contrary to the Abstract Expressionism, Sol LeWitt defined conceptual art with his statement that the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. He helped establish Conceptual art and Minimalism of the postwar era. Believing that the idea itself could be the work of art and displace the artist into the position of a generator of that idea, LeWitt considered creation as an intellectual and pragmatic act. Conceiving of a work is the only artist’s obligation, then he can either delegate the production to others or can choose to even never make it at all. His work ranged from wall drawings, structures (a term he preferred instead of sculptures), painting and conceptual pieces that remained the elements of the artistic process.   Sol LeWitt was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1928. After he finished his studies at the Syracuse University, in 1951 was drafted in the Korean War. During his service, he was making posters and spending some time in Japan, he started buying artworks, making his own collection. Settling in the New York in 1953 and finishing Cartoonist and Illustrators School, his first job was for Seventeen Magazine. Later on, LeWitt was hired in one architecture office as a graphic designer and of the crucial importance for his career was the engagement at the Museum of Modern Art where he was introduced to the work of Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and Jasper Johns. He was also influenced by postulates of the Russian Constructivism which was propagated industrial aesthetic and utilitarian art. A book, with Eadweard Muybridge’s serial photography, sequential studies of people and animals in motion, which somebody had left in his apartment will later on turn out to be the biggest influence on his work. His works on canvas coated with thick layers of oil paint and also three-dimensional pieces constructed in the second half of the 60’s as Serial Project, or numerous sculptures made of open white cubes, were directly inspired by Muybridge’s serial.      His first drawing, Wall Drawing #1, had been revealed in 1968 at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York. It has consisted of a system of parallel lines in four directions, drawn with the black pencil on a white wall, like numerous after this one. Considering two-dimensional works only as a manifestation of an idea, and not as objects, his drawings had a limited duration and all of them were ultimately painted over. The existence of the wall drawings was determined as a set of instructions that could be installed repeatedly. After the first one which he did by himself, LeWitt soon made a team of assistants that worked under his plans. On that way, the idea of his work surpassed the work itself.  In the next two years, he created four Drawing series, presenting various combinations of the basic geometrical elements. Applying a different system of change to each of twenty-four possible combinations of a divided square with one of the four types of lines he used (horizontal, vertical, diagonal left and right), the first series was called Rotation, the second Mirror, the third Cross and Reverse Mirror and the fourth was Cross Reverse. In his late work, in 2005, LeWitt started a series of scribble wall drawings which required filling the areas by scribbling with the graphite.  During his career, he created more than 1270 wall drawings, but most of them are executed by his assistances. Their existence is limited by the duration of the exhibition. Having the meaning of ephemeral form, these artworks can be installed, removed and reinstalled as many times as need.    Putting the cube in the focus of his exploration, in early 60’s, Sol LeWitt began to create his three-dimensional works, calling them the structures. The simplified forms of the open cube, made of wood and lacquered by hand, became a basic building block for the sculptures. From 1969, he constructed in industrial materials, as aluminum and steel, and later, during the 80’s he was using cinder and concrete blocks. His work culminated in 9 Towers, 2007, installed in Lilla Stenshuvud in Sweden which represents a cube made from more than 1000 colored bricks five meters high on each side.     Exploring ideas rather than conventional aesthetics, Sol LeWitt redefined the art production, reduce it to its essentials. Using the system of lines and the cube as a basic element, his work is characterized by serialization, repetition and progression. Sol LeWitt died in 2007 in New York City. Since 1964, his work has been exhibited in numerous solo and group shows and could be found in the most important museum collections around the world, including MoMA, New York, Tate Modern, London, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris. He earned a place in the history of art as a leading person of his time. His directions for producing work of art simplified the comprehension of the work itself. It was no longer required to have a physical presence in order to be considered art. ",891
Richard Serra,"Best known for his large-scale minimalist sculptures, Richard Serra is a celebrated American artist whose art has graced numerous exhibitions in museums and galleries throughout the world. Working mostly in steel, he has managed to create both minimalist and monumental, site-specific structures which are self-supporting, reflecting the nature of the material. Serra’s colossal, strangely balanced pieces have explored and redefined man’s relationship with the surrounding world. His work doesn’t only occupy space, but radically seek to discover its essence and purpose. Over the years, Serra has become a beacon of inspiration for those creatives who examine the vast field of urban interventions and installations. Amongst sculpture, his rich body of work includes painting, drawing, video, performance, writing and dance.   Serra was born in San Francisco, CA in 1939. During World War II, Serra’s father worked as a pipe fitter for a shipyard near San Francisco, and afterward the family bought a spec home on the western edge of the city. His mother tried to teach her three sons—Tony Jr., Richard and Rudy—to embrace cultural pursuits.[1] As a teenager, Serra worked in a steel mill to help send himself to school. He studied English literature at the Berkeley, University of California. In addition, he transferred to Santa Barbara University where he graduated in 1961. One year later, Serra continued his education in School of Art and Architecture, within the M.F.A. program at the Yale University and then in Florence and Paris - thanks to receiving a Yale Traveling Fellowship for Paris, and a Fulbright grant for Rome. While living in New York in the 1960s, he met and befriended with a number of artists, dancers, playwrights and musicians whose experiments helped redefine what art could be. Serra and his colleagues like Robert Smithson, Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman, put down their paintbrushes and started making radical artworks using materials like dirt, rubber and wax. Serra decided to experiment with lead and steel.    Serra’s work has played a very important role in a development of the modern abstract sculpture. Some of his earlier works of art were made out of fiberglass and rubber. As he used to work in steel mills while studying, the strong influence of this material and its production process is obvious in his later work. Serra’s early sculptures are minimalist constructions made from large rolls and sheets of metal - Cor-Ten Steel, fabricated in Germany and installed by Budco Enterprises. Although he would become best known for his colossal pieces, Serra began his career making works that were less monumental and mostly process-oriented. Along with other process artists, his work emphasized the process and act of artistic creation rather than the resulting work that comes out of it.    In the beginning of the 70s, Serra focused on outdoors, pioneering large-scale and site-specific pieces that create a dialogue with a particular architectural, urban, or landscape setting. First step was always to make a small model from flat plates of steel and to consult a structural engineer to make sure that the large sculpture retains a balance and stability as its smaller model. Shapes he usually created were monumental arcs, spirals, and ellipses. Some of Serra’s first larger commissions were realized mostly outside of US. Pieces such as Shift from 1970 was made for Ontario, while Spin Out (1972-1973) went to Holland.   In the mid-70s, Serra started producing large-scale drawings on Belgian linen and on handmade Hitomi paper. First, he used only ink, charcoal, and lithographic crayon on paper. After a while, he decided to combine installation and drawing creating monumental works called ”Installation Drawings” on canvas or linen and pinned to the wall and later covered with black paint stick, one sort of grease wax crayon.[2] Serra’s Abstract Slavery from 1974 or Pacific Judson Murphy from 1978 are perfect examples of this innovative technique. Almost all of his drawings are created once a sculpture is completed – for example, the artwork titled Drawings after Circuit (1972) is based on an installation Serra prepared for documenta in Kassel, Germany. Serra has participated in several documenta exhibitions: 1972, 1977, 1982, and 1987. In 2011, he held an exhibition of these pieces at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The theme was his old pieces on paper, now destroyed or damaged. He re-created some of them, especially for this show. All of the pieces presented had two dates, when the  original was made and the new version.   A controversy hit the artist’s work in the 1980s – when his, commissioned by the federal General Services Administration, installation named Tilted Arc was presented at the Federal Plaza on Foley Square in Lower Manhattan. This 120-foot-long, 12-foot-high slab of curved steel sculpture[3] was positioned in a manner that did not allow people to simply ignore it. They had to involve with the piece, walking around it just to cross the plaza. Because of its massive and demanding nature and aspect, in 1985 a special jury voted 4 to 1 in favor of removing the sculpture. Tilted Arc was cut up in three pieces and taken from the plaza in the middle of the night in 1989. The artist’s methods of creations, his chosen themes and materials are, according to many feminist art historians and critics, some sort of a swan song of masculine themes and artistic processes coming from the Abstract Expressionism.    During the 90s, Serra created one of his most famous series titled Torqued Ellipses, made from 1996 to 1999. The idea behind this series is that gigantic plates of towering steel create private spaces in large public sites, where they have been erected. A sculpture preceding Torqued Ellipses was titled Snake (Sugea), and was made between 1994 and 1997. The Snake is located in Guggenheim Museum Bilbao – for which inauguration was made in the first place. Both Snake and the Torqued Ellipses seem to defy gravity and logic, making solid metal appear as malleable as felt.[4]   It was not before 2005 that the American artist installed his first public work in his hometown San Francisco. Ballast is a 160 tons piece created in 2004, consisting of two steel blades and it is located in the University of California campus' main open space. A 2008 installation titled Promenade was presented in the Grand Palais at Monumenta exhibition. 17-meters-high Promenade was made out of five colossal steel sheets placed at every 100-foot and it was created especially for this event. Before Serra, that privilege had only Anselm Kiefer, who was invited to fill the 13,500 m² nave of the Grand Palais, in the heart of Paris on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.   During his career, Serra was inspired and dedicated some of his work to such artist as Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Buster Keaton, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the art critic David Sylvester. Serra produced an installation titled Charlie Brown, in 2000 – a year when Peanut’s creator passed away. This tribute to Charles M. Schulz is a 60-foot tall sculpture in San Francisco’s Gap headquarters. That same year, Serra won the Golden Lion for Contemporary Art at the 49th Venice Biennale. However, there was a time when he was actually uninspired by some of the big shots. In 2006, the artist created quite a commotion when he presented two crayon drawings at the Whitney Biennal. The drawings depicted an Abu Ghraib prisoner, and the caption was: STOP BUSH. Whitney even used this image to design posters for Biennial. But, Serra did not stop there. Inspired by Goya's Saturn, he drew Bush devouring his son. The image was also used by the website pleasevote.com and on The Nation issue in July 2005.    Serra's oeuvre can’t be classified easily - it is primarily a sculpture, an architecture, and even a fragment of modern industry and painting, all at one time. He was awarded many times; Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture, The Goslarer Kaiserring, Wilhelm Lehmbruck Prize for Sculpturein. He received The Presidentʼs Medal from the Architectural League of New York in 2014, and curiosity is that he was the first artist to receive this prize. He also won honorary degrees of Doctor of Fine Arts by Williams Collegein, College of Arts and Crafts in California, University of Yale and Harvard as well, College of Arts and Design in Nova Scotia, Universidad Pública de Navarra. Serra became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993 and in 2006, of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and National Academy of Design. In 2015, the American artist received the French government's biggest award, the insignia of Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor. [5]   Over the years, Richard Serra has become one of the most acclaimed living artists for his challenging and innovative work, which emphasizes materiality and an engagement between the viewer, the site, and the work. He radically changed the traditional idea of sculpture and expanded the concept through monumental scale of his works and meticulously created relationships with the surrounding space. His work is owned by some of the major art museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Since his first one-man show in 1966 at Galleria La Salita in the capital of Italy, Serra has had numerous exhibitions throughout the world, including a 1986 retrospective at the MoMA.     ",892
Nobuyoshi Araki,"One of the most important living Japanese artists, Nobuyoshi Araki is a photographer whose work revolves around female eroticism and his fascination with Tokyo, Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. Notorious for pictures that are both spectacularly compelling and shockingly obscene, Araki - who has created over 450 books in his lifetime - has an unearthly ability to make anything and everything appear erotic. His controversial body of work featuring provocative depictions of female eroticism, bondage, and fetishism, has seen his oeuvre described as both erotic and pornographic and has provoked conflict with authorities in Japan and controversy in the West.  Born on May 25, 1940, in Tokyo, Nobuyoshi Araki studied photography and filmmaking at Chiba University. Upon graduating in 1963, he pursued a career as a commercial photographer at the advertising agency Dentsu. During this period, he exhibited in his first show, Satchin and Mabo, and won a photography contest for the collection of post-war photographs, Satchin from 1963, which reveals some of the devastation from the war and the need for a fresh start in Japanese society. He became famous for Un Voyage Sentimental (Sentimental Journey), 1971, a series of photos documenting his personal life, in particular, his wedding and honeymoon with his wife, Yoko Araki, whom the artist credits for making him a photographer. The series established his reputation, and in 1972, he left Dentsu to work as a freelance photographer. Since then, almost all his work has revolved around his own life and are almost always about the women who are close to him. Later, in Winter Journey series, Araki documented his wife’s terminal battle with cancer. The series was concluded in 2010 with Spring Journey in which Araki’s beloved cat, Chiro, originally given to Yoko, was photographed in the last stage of her life.   Over the years, Nobuyoshi Araki has become instantly recognizable by his daring photographs of naked female bodies, which have always strived to achieve the aesthetic value of Shunga, Japanese woodblock prints that were widely popular between the 17th and the 20th century. Both aggressively pornographic and artistically sophisticated, Shunga portrayed the sex lives of ordinary people, an element that Araki has picked up on in his nude photographs. Araki’s images of women wearing kimonos with revealed genitals is a modern take on Shunga that includes a shyness to the subjects by being never revealing their entire bodies.   The Japanese intricate art of erotic bondage, Kinbaku-bi (literally “the beauty of tight binding”) has long fascinated Nobuyoshi Araki, and it has a strong presence in the works. The images of bondage began to appear in his oeuvre in 1979 and though often called sexist, fetishistic, degrading and insulting, the photographer sees the photographs as freeing the souls of the models. One of his most famous series entitled Kinbaku explores the delicate traditional art of bondage by reducing the subject to a minimal, monochromatic aesthetic. Precisely executed, the intricate knots and specific rope patterns indent the models’ bodies as they hang suspended in mid-air, both contorted and elegantly streamlined. On several occasions, police raided and closed Araki’s exhibitions, confiscated works and arrested the artist for violations of obscenity laws. And yet Araki’s portrayal censored subject matter has contributed to a loosening of the strictures imposed on photographers.   Although well known for his infamous nude photography, Araki has a passion for capturing many aspects of his hometown whether it be ordinary people on the streets, the city itself or exploring the subcultures that exist away from the public eye. Tokyo Lucky Hole is Araki’s iconic series of work that offers a privileged view of Tokyo's underworld in the 1980s when the sex industry in Japan’s capital was in full flower. Araki prowled Shinjuku, the city's famous red light district, taking pictures in the sex shops and clubs. His project came to an abrupt end when the district was closed by judicial decree in 1985. In over 800 photos, Tokyo Lucky Hole photobook documents the free-for-all spirit of those clubs via Araki’s lens. His photographs form a historical record of Shinjuku's glory days and a portrait of a lesser-known side of Tokyo life.   Araki’s works are part of numerous notable collections including that of the Tate Modern, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Fotomuseum Winterthur in Switzerland. He has worked as a filmmaker and has photographed musicians Bjork and Lady Gaga. He has also photographed for many pornographic magazines such as Playboy, DejA-Vu, and Erotic Housewives. The artist's life and work were the subjects of Travis Klose‘s 2005 documentary film Arakimentari. He is the recipient of many awards, including the 1994 Japan Inter-Design Forum Grand Prix, the 1990 Society of Photography Award, and the 1964 Sun Prize. The indefatigable artist, now in his seventies, has suffered from reduced sight in his right eye in October 2013, which served as inspiration for a new series of photographs entitled Love on the Left Eye.   Photographing subjects that range from flowers to kinbaku to Tokyo street scenes, Nobuyoshi Araki continues to astound observers with a plethora of stunning and provocative photos. Notorious for his challenging, emotionally raw images and explicit depictions of sexuality and mortality, Nobuyoshi Araki has been one of the Japanese most eminent and prolific photographers who remain ever-popular, after all, provocative and sexual pieces have always been fresh and original. The artist is represented by Zooart.  ",893
Eric Fischl,"The pleasure of observing has certainly rounded the work of Eric Fischl and made it being perceived as an ode to various aspects of voyeurism. The very act of observation is inherent to human nature and starting from that commonplace the artist starts processing and articulating his thoughts and ideas. By carefully selecting random situations from both his personal and professional life, Fischl intersects certain social mechanisms and creates narratives filled with humor, sensuality, and intrigue. As a matter of fact, his works can be seen as metaphors of contemporaneity since they function as notes of the variety of human behavior.  Eric Fischl was born in 1948 in New York City. He grew up on suburban Long Island, but in 1967 his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Fischl started attending Phoenix College, then switched to Arizona State University, and finally California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California, where he earned his BFA in 1972. Afterward, the artist settled in Chicago, where worked for some time as a guard at the Museum of Contemporary Art. In 1974, he moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to teach painting at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, where he met painter April Gornik, with whom he moved back to New York City in 1978.   Memories from growing up in suburbia practically shaped Fischl's oeuvre. The artist was actually focused on the rift between what was experienced and what could not be said. The discovery of Chicago artists from the 60’s gathered around the exhibitions titled Hairy Who or the ones who belonged to the circle of Chicago imagists, profoundly influenced Eric Fischl. Vibrant pallet and explicit imagery he found very appealing and so he decided to appropriate it. His first New York City solo show was at Edward Thorp Gallery in 1979, and soon afterward he received critical attention for depicting the dark, disturbing undercurrents of mainstream American life.    The seriousness of topics such as alcoholism, depression, and poverty was transferred on canvas with great softness and vigor, and therefore Fischl has quickly embraced the description of himself as a painter of the suburbs. Some of Fischl's earlier works have a theme of adolescent sexuality and voyeurism, while later works operate with socially, even politically more elaborate concepts. Nevertheless, it seems that one of the most frequent issues present in his work is a critique of the art world. From the 80’s onward, Fischl has been cynical about the parties and gallery openings and cocaine and booze and money, which had and still has little to do with his general agenda of coherent art.   Besides fruitful artistic career, Eric Fischl is the founder, President and lead curator for America: Now and Here. This multi-disciplinary exhibition of 150 of some of the Americas most celebrated visual artists, musicians, poets, playwrights, and filmmakers is designed to spark a national conversation about American identity through the arts. About eighteen trucks were custom-designed to serve as mobile galleries traveling to each location, where they will unfold to reveal exhibition space. On the other hand, Eric Fischl is a Fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Science and is a senior critic at the New York Academy of Art.   Perhaps one of the most interesting projects which somehow extended his interest in voyeuristic experiments is certainly the one released in 2002 at the Museum Haus Esters in Krefeld. It was built by legendary modern architect Mies van der Rohe in 1928, but in recent times it is used as an exhibition space concept of changing exhibitions. Fischl refurnished it as a home and hired models who pretended to be a couple who lived there for several days; he took 2,000 photographs, which he reworked digitally and used as the basis for a series of paintings. Fischl has collaborated with other artists and authors, including E.L. Doctorow, Allen Ginsberg, Jamaica Kincaid, Jerry Saltz and Frederic Tuten.   The artistic domains of this internationally acclaimed American painter and sculptor have been honored in a number of occasions. His artwork is represented in many distinguished museums throughout the world and has been featured in over one thousand publications, numerous solo and major group exhibitions in many museums, as well as prestigious private and corporate collections. The immense influence on generations of young artists is additionally straitened by the fact that Eric Fischl is still innovative, progressive and one of the most influential figurative painters of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Eduardo Chillida,"The oeuvre of Eduardo Chillida represents one of the finest examples of thinking the media differently in regards to its conventions. Namely, it is hard to describe his works as mere sculptures, rather they can be classified as site specifics or spatial interventions. The way Chillida articulates the mass and volume, the material and the very space, reflects the immense focus on the production of meaning. Although his works are indeed abstract, they are permeated with conceptual questions and metaphysical concerns.   Eduardo Chillida was born in 1924, in San Sebastián.  He was raised in an influential family, with his father being a major and mother a soprano. As a young boy, Chillida practiced football for the local Real Sociedad team, but his knee was severely injured and that caused the end of the promising football career. From 1942 to 1946 he studied architecture at the University of Madrid, but in 1947 decided to abandoned architecture for art.  Shortly after, Chillida moved to Paris, where he set up his first studio.  In 1950 Chillida married Pilar Belzunce and later returned to the San Sebastián area, first to the nearby village and in 1959 to the city of his birth, where he remained until the end of his life.    In the begging, the artist worked with clay and plaster, but soon he started focusing on using steel and granite, the materials with which he could deal with the empty space, the vacuum and the horizon. Upon returning to the Basque Country in 1951, Eduardo Chillida soon abandoned the plaster and transferred to  working with  forged iron. The artist opened his studio and started producing the works in collaboration with the local blacksmith. For some of the works, Chillida used wood as a base and in 1965 he began making sculpture in alabaster. Rather than turning over a maquette of a sculpture to fabricators, the artist worked closely with the men in the workshops.    Initially, Chillida was concentrated on the human form, especially torsos and busts, while his later works tended to be more massive and more abstract. After he rediscovered iron the artist produced his first Abstract style sculpture which was called Ilarik. That work was a primitive and austere piece of sculpture but it incorporated some of Chillida's favorite elements: space, emptiness, scale, and matter.  Actually, it represents the introduction in a further development of almost brutal and industrialized aesthetics. As the time passed by his works have become more and more massive and monumental, suggesting movement and tension.   Already in 1954, Chillida produced the four doors for the basilica of Arantzazu, and the following year, he carved a stone monument to the discoverer of penicillin, Sir Alexander Fleming, for a park in San Sebastián.  Since he became established author, by the early 1970s several of his steel sculptures had been installed in front of the Unesco headquarters in Paris, the ThyssenKrupp building in Düsseldorf, and in a courtyard at the World Bank offices in Washington. Interestingly, for one of the most astonishing works of his titled Monument of Tolerance, an artificial cave was dug into the mountain.    Much of Chillida’s work is inspired by his Basque upbringing, and many of his sculptures have titles in the Euskera Basque language. Nevertheless, in the early 1960s, the artist engaged in a dialog with the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, which had a huge impact on his further work. They were discussing the concept of the space. The philosopher proposed that the sculpture shows us how we belong to the world, the world in the midst of a technological process of uprooting and homelessness and how we can still find room to dwell therein.   Despite the fact that Chillida received international attention, his work went unnoticed in Spain for some time. Simultaneously with sculpture, he has realized quite a number of etchings, lithographs, and woodcuts since 1959. The artist had solo shows and retrospectives all around the globe and participated at the Documenta exhibition in Kassel three times. His works are in major museums, and in 2000 Chillida opened his own museum in Hernani, fulfilling a lifelong dream and passed away at the age of 78. The notable sculpture was modest, and tended to reject the label of abstract"", preferring being called a realist sculptor.  The impressive body of work, as well as deep understanding of matter and form, made Eduardo Chillida one of the most important Spanish sculptors of the 20th century. Eduardo Chillida passed away in 2002, at his home near San Sebastián. ",895
Mimmo Paladino,"Mimmo Paladino (Domenico Paladino) is an Italian artist born on 18 December 1948 in Paduli, Campania, southern Italy. He is known as a sculptor, painter and printmaker. He played a leading part in the international revival of painting towards the end of the 1970s. In his first work, in line with the prevailing conceptual climate at the time, he showed an interest in photography, but in 1977 he had already moved on to the creation of two major tempera murals, one at the Toselli gallery in Milan and one at the Lucio Amelio gallery in Naples. In 1980, he exhibited his work at the Venice Biennale, in the ""Aperto 80"" exhibition. However, it was largely thanks to a picture exhibition held in a range of Central European museums, from the Kunsthalle in Basel, to the Museum Folkwang in Essen and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, that Paladino finally consolidated his international fame. In 1981, the Kunstmuseum in Basel organised a major personal exhibition of paintings, curated by Dieter Koepplin. The Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Bologna also dedicated a personal exhibition to him that year. In the early 1980s, he began making his first sculptures. Exhibitions followed, one after the other, and in 1981 Paladino took part in A New Spirit in Painting, at the Royal Academy of Art in London, and the Paris Biennale. In the following year, 1982, he took part in the Sydney Biennial and the Documenta 7 in Kassel. He exhibited at the Transavantgarde exhibition in 1983, at the Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona, the New Art exhibition in London's Tate Gallery that same year, and the Det Italienska Transavangardet at the Lunds Konsthall in Stockholm, the following year. Drawing always plays a fundamental part in Paladino's work, and he was the leading participant in the 1983 Nuovi Disegni exhibition at the Kunstmuseum in Basel.  In the 1990s, he began carrying out important interventions on urban spaces, such as the permanent Hortus Conclusus installation in the San Domenico cloisters, in Benevento (1992). In 1994 he was granted a personal exhibition in Naples, in the Scuderie di Palazzo Reale, Villa Pignatelli Cortes, and piazza Plebiscito, where he installed the Montagna di sale. In 2001, the general catalogue of his graphic work was published (Opera Grafica 1974-2001), curated by Enzo di Martino, for Art of this Century, New York – Paris. The Centro d'Arte Contemporanea Luigi Pecci, Prato, granted him the most comprehensive retrospective exhibition ever organised by an Italian museum, curated by Bruno Corà in 2002. In 2003, together with Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, and Nicola de Maria, he put on Transavanguardia 1979-1985 at the Castello di Rivoli Museo di Arte Contemporanea, curated by Ida Gianelli.  In 2004, he created the doors for the Padre Pio church in San Giovanni Rotondo, designed by Renzo Piano. In 2005 he exhibited at the Museum der Moderne Rupertinum in Salzburg, and the Loggetta Lombardesca in Ravenna put on Paladino in Scena, a major exhibition of his theatre work, curated by Claudio Spadoni. In 2007, he produced two theatre set designs for OEdipus Rex and Cavalleria rusticana, for the Teatro Regio in Turin, and put on a personal exhibition at the Galleria Civica in Modena. In 2008 he presented a major installation at the Museo dell’Ara Pacis in Rome. In 2009, a group of his sculptures was shown in Orta San Giulio, Lake of Orta, in a show curated by Flavio Arensi. In 2010 Mimmo Paladino designed the set of Work in Progress, a tour which featured the reunion of the famous Italian singer songwriters Lucio Dalla and Francesco De Gregori, thirty years after their previous joint initiative. At the end of January 2011 he designed the new permanent room at the National Archaeological Museum in Villa Frigerj in Chieti devoted to the Warrior of Capestrano and he opened the exhibition of sculptures that focused on the new Warrior, housed at the exhibition centre of the Fondazione Carichieti in Palazzo De Mayo. An important exhibition on his ceramics was held in the Museo MIC in Faenza in 2012 and, in the same year, he designed an installation of a large marble cross in Piazza Santa Croce in Florence. Paladino currently lives and works in Rome, Paduli and Mattinata.",896
Bert Stern,"Bert Stern is an American commercial and fashion photographer, born in 1929, who is considered as one of the legendary figures in contemporary photography. His highly stylized, black and white images of Hollywood actresses are classics, depicting the golden age of film industry and advertising. Bert was born in Brooklyn, New York, in a family of Jewish immigrants. Self-taught in photography, Stern dropped out of high school at the age of 16, and began his career working as a messenger and mail clerk at Look magazine in 1947. In this period, Stern studied art books at the library, and often visited the Museum of Modern Art. Between 1949 and 1951, he was the art director at Mayfair magazine, where he learned how to develop film and make contact sheets, and started taking his own pictures. Afterwards he rejoined Bramson at L.C. Gumbiner advertising agency, and helped create the modern advertising photograph. When he was drafted during the Korean War, Stern photographed the troops' ships heading to Japan. Upon his return to the United States, Stern explored advertising photography, and achieved success with his work for Smirnoff Vodka, including one of his most famous images - Giza pyramid reflected upside down in a martini glass. Stern personified the commercial photographer as cultural hero in the 1960s, and became the American prototype of the fashion photographer as media star. Hugely successful in the worlds of fashion and advertising photography, in the late 1960s he operated a studio, not unlike Andy Warhol’s Factory, from which he created countless award-winning ads, editorial features, magazine covers, films, and portraits. Besides working for such clients as IBM, Vogue, Glamour, Life, Revlon, and Smirnoff, he was highly acclaimed for his portraits of celebrities including Gary Cooper and Louis Armstrong. His portraits of stars ranging from Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn to Drew Barrymore, including The Last Sitting photographs of Marilyn Monroe, form a gallery of the most beautiful women of our time. In all of Stern’s works can be seen the remarkable graphic simplicity of his photographic art, as well as his extraordinary rapport with his subjects. Bert Stern first published his book The Last Sitting in 1982. The book included a large number of the over 2,500 images that Stern had shot, including contact sheets with images Monroe had disliked and crossed out. In the book, Stern recounted being enchanted by Monroe until a near-intimate encounter after the second day of shooting. These photos were taken for Vogue over a three-day period, six weeks before Marilyn’s death. In the 1960s, his heavy use of amphetamines, led to the destruction to his marriage to Allegra Kent, a ballerina. Between 1971 and 1975, Stern lived in Spain. Since 1976, he has continued working in New York on personal as well as commercial assignments. He also directed the documentary film Jazz on a Summer´s Day, in addition to creating the still photography for Stanley Kubrick’s film version of Lolita. Stern's photography has been exhibited all over the world, including Tokyo, London, and New York. He died in the summer of 2013, aged 83.",897
Jesus Rafael Soto,"Thanks to the deep understanding of negative space and geometry, Venezuelan artist Jesús Rafael Soto became one of the pioneers of kinetic and op art. Throughout his career, the artist received many commissions to create work for public spaces and institutions, such as UNESCO and Chacaíto metro station in Caracas, and the Royal Bank of Toronto. Soto exhibited in Berlin, London, New York, Paris, and Tokyo. Today his works which sell in auctions for up to seven-figure sums, are part of several public and private collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Fondazione Antonio y Carmela Calderara, Italy; Tate Museum, London; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C.; and Fundación Museo de Arte Moderno Jesús Soto, Venezuela.   Jesús Rafael Soto was born in 1923, in Ciudad Bolívar. He graduated from the Escuela de artes plásticas in Caracas in 1947 and soon after became a director of Escuela de bellas artes in Maracaibo. It was there that the artist first encountered the works of Mondrian and Malevich and decided to move to Paris in 1950. He exhibited his works at the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles where he met experimental artists Yves Klein, Iris Clert, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and Pol Bury. In his early works, Soto was interested in introducing movement into his illusionistic paintings by means of repetition. The three-dimensional forms he created by using layered plexiglass shifted between the organic and geometrical forms. In 1955 together with the ZERO group, he took part in the now legendary exhibition Le Mouvement (The Movement) at Galerie Denise René, which launched the Kinetic art movement.   The 1960s marked the shift from gestural abstraction to a geometric idiom. Soto began creating large-scale kinetic installations using steel, nylon, and Perspex. For the artist, the viewer became the central figure whom he invites to walk around and through his works and observe the world around them. Soto said: Thus his first Penetrables constructed from nylon strands hanging from a metal frame were born in 1967. Numerous solo exhibitions followed where the artist transformed the gallery space into a kinetic installation that invited spectators into the environment that blurred the boundaries between illusion and reality.   Soto had numerous solo exhibitions, including at Signals Gallery in London (1965), Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1969), and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (1974). He was commissioned to create two murals for the UNESCO building in Paris and the installation for a Teatro Teresa Carreño in Caracas. In 1973 the museum of modern art in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela was named after the artist - Museo de arte moderno Jesús Soto. Jesús Rafael Soto passed away in 2005 in Paris. ",898
Helen Frankenthaler,"Widely considered to be a major contributor to the history of postwar American art, Helen Frankenthaler was an abstract expressionist painter who was an active artist for over six decades. Due to her talent and long artistic reign, Frankenthaler influenced generations of modern painters with her vital and ever-changing work[1]. Among a variety of phases and stylistic shifts she went through during her life, Helen is mostly respected for her role as one of the most crucial painters to tackle the famous Color Field method - a style of American abstract painting which features large expanses of unmodulated color covering the greater part of the canvas. This career path Frankenthaler chose for herself effectively engraved her name in the art history next to the likes of Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko.  Helen Frankenthaler was born on December 12th in the year of 1928, in the heart of New York City. She was a daughter of Alfred Frankenthaler, a respected Supreme Court judge held in high regard both in and outside of the Big Apple borders. As she was spending her early childhood on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Helen enjoyed every aspect of life that goes alongside being a member of a cultured and progressive Jewish intellectual family[2]. Since her parents expected their heirs to continue the family's successful business endeavors, Frankenthaler and her two sisters were encouraged to prepare themselves for professional careers from an early age. However, Helen persisted in her desires to study artistic expression despite such pressures within her home. Ultimately, her parents accepted that fact and she was sent to study at the Dalton School before she began attending classes at the Bennington College in Vermont. It was here that Frankenthaler learned everything about pictorial composition and started to demonstrate a cubist-derived style which marked her early career. After she received her diploma in the year of 1949, Helen studied privately with Australian-born painter Wallace Harrison, and later with Hans Hofmann. During this time, Frankenthaler had a relationship with Clement Greenberg, but she decided to leave him and marry a fellow artist Robert Motherwell in 1958. The two were a couple to the year if 1971 when their divorce became official.  After all the influences that affected Helen's art were done modeling her creative vocabulary, Frankenthaler's work became very resistant to analysis and characterization. She was initially associated with abstract expressionism due to her focus on forms latent in nature. Helen was fond of and easily recognizable for her use of fluid shapes, abstract masses and lyrical gestures that were not truly rivaled by any contemporary artist. Like most of her colleagues back then, Frankenthaler preferred working in large formats that proved to be the best possible choice for her often very simplified abstract compositions. Helen put special emphasis on spontaneity, as evidenced by her own statement: A really good picture looks as if it's happened at once. It's an immediate image. For my own work, when a picture looks labored and overworked, and you can read in it—well, she did this and then she did that, and then she did that—there is something in it that has not got to do with beautiful art to me. And I usually throw these out, though I think very often it takes ten of those over-labored efforts to produce one really beautiful wrist motion that is synchronized with your head and heart, and you have it, and therefore it looks as if it were born in a minute. Chronologically speaking, Frankenthaler's official artistic career was launched during the year of 1952 when her exhibition titled Mountains and Sea opened its gates to the wider public. Since then and throughout all the years of the 1950s, her artworks showed tendencies to be highly focused on the center, meaning that the majority of main pictorial incidents took place in the middle of the canvas, while the edges were of little consequence to the composition as a whole. Around the year of 1957, Helen started to experiment and take her work down a new path when she began introducing linear shapes and more organic, rounded forms. She also started exploring the potential of symmetrical paintings which was the first time Frankenthaler was interested in the edges of her paintings.  Soon, Frankenthaler art took another turn as she put in motion another general simplification of her style. She began to make use of single stains and blots of solid color against white backgrounds, often in the form of geometric shapes. At this time, Helen also abandoned oil paints and turned to acrylic as they allowed for more opacity and sharpness than her previous materials. Frankenthaler turned to thicker layers of color as well, hoping that more concentrated paint would enable her to employ brighter tones and reminisce her love for the early avant-garde. By the 1970s, Helen was completely done with her now-legendary soak-stain technique. Her work became much calmer and relaxed, as evidenced both by her shades and brushwork. Her application of a single color to large areas, or fields as they were more commonly called, was the reason why Frankenthaler's was described as a part of the Color Field movement. This style was characterized by the use of hues that were similar in tone or intensity, organized in large formats and more or less simplified compositions - all of these were qualities descriptive of Frankenthaler’s work. Interestingly, the practitioners of the Color Field saw themselves apart from the Abstract Expressionists because they stayed clear of emotional, mythic or the religious content, allowing the personal and gestural painterly application to take precedent.    When she matured as an artist and left the turbulent and wild lifestyle with Robert Motherwell behind her, Frankenthaler preferred to paint in privacy and isolation, letting the silence influence her inner thought. Some pieces required assistants, but even then Helen instructed them to be as quiet and inconspicuous as humanly possible. She also recognized that, as an artist, she needed to constantly challenge herself in order to grow. Keeping that in mind, she began to experiment with printmaking at a lithographic workshop in West Islip, Long Island. Tatyana Grosman, a skilled silkscreen artist, helped Helen a lot as she was beginning this chapter of her career. It should also be noted that Clifford Ross was Helen's cousin - he is a famous artist who combines several mediums, including photography, video, sculpture and painting, all in order to create his unique artworks. In 1976, Frankenthaler expanded her art a step forward by practicing the medium of woodcuts. For the next three decades, Helen created pieces of art from the fields of painting, silkscreen prints and woodcuts, defining the current directions these mediums were following with every artwork. Besides her creative endeavors, Frankenthaler also served on the National Council on the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts between the years of 1985 to 1992. In 1994, she married Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr., an investment banker who worked for the Ford administration. Although she was often connected to the feminist movements that were popping up all over the world at the time, Frankenthaler did not consider herself a feminist[3]. Followers of such ideas would regularly desire to build their campaigns around Helen's name, but she would always distance herself by simply stating that she never had a single obstacle or issue due to her gender. As a crown achievement for her life's work, Frankenthaler received the National Medal of Arts in the year of 2001. When all was said and done, her other greatest awards included the First Prize for Painting at the first Paris Biennial, Temple Gold Medal, New York City Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture and Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement. She passed away in 2011 at her home in Darien, Connecticut[4].    Ultimately, it should be noted that art critics have never unanimously praised Frankenthaler’s work. Some were not impressed by, what they called, thinness in substance and uncontrolled method. Some critics were even bold enough to brand Helen's art as too sweet in color and too poetic, without always defining what poetic exactly is in their opinion. However, there were by far more individuals who enjoyed and appreciated Frankenthaler’s work, praising the informality and impulse of her compositions. One of the main backers of Helen's pieces was Barbara Rose, a famous critic whose word traveled quite far and was always appreciated. In one of her most famous statements concerning the art of Helen Frankenthaler, Rose hailed the freedom, spontaneity, openness and complexity of an image, not exclusively of the studio or the mind, but explicitly and intimately tied to nature and human emotions. This artist is represented by Gagosian Park & 75 New York, Gagosian West 24th Street New York, Gagosian Beverly Hills, Gagosian Britannia Street London, Puccio Fine Art, Kunzt.gallery and Gagosian West 21st Street New York.

Mark Tobey,"Mark Tobey was an American painter considered a pioneer of abstract expressionism. He became widely known for his innovative and delicate abstract works which are composed in a particular style called white writing.  Mark Tobey has always strived to represent the mystical and otherworldly through his art, which was partially caused by his eastern religious beliefs. The artist has strongly embraced Buddhism, Arabic calligraphy, and classical music and mixed them together, which resulted in the creation of a unique visual language. This language got the name white writing and it combines all-over painting with gestural abstraction.  Tobey was born in Centerville, Wisconsin in 1890. He comes from the Segregationalist family and he was the youngest of four children. He was interested in visual arts and decided to study at the Art Institute of Chicago, but at the same time, he was mostly self-taught, which contributed to the pioneering and experimental nature of his work. In 1911, Tobey has moved to New York City and started working as a fashion illustrator for McCall's. Already after a couple of years spent in NYC, his first solo exhibit was held at M. Knoedler & Co. This show was organized by Marie Steiner and she has introduced Tobey to Juliet Thompson, a portrait painter from NYC. Thompson was a follower of the Bahá' í World Faith, and through her Tobey gained an interest in this religion. In 1918 he has formally accepted this faith and got converted at Green Acre the Bahá' í School, which had a profound influenced not only on his artistic development but also on his entire lifestyle. He started to explore the representation of the spiritual in art and read Bahá'í literature as well as more commercial literature based on Eastern philosophy, such as the poems of Khalil Gibran, which are based on mystical Sufi influences.   In his early days,  Tobey claimed that forms should be free and dynamic, and this approach was clearly against the old school, Renaissance sense of order. He wanted to shed a new light and give a certain release to lines and forms. Unfortunately, his works that illustrated this attitude got lost. Encouraged by a friend, Tobey left New York and moved to Seattle in 1922, where he was offered a teaching position at the Cornish School. During his days spent at this school, Tobey started to explore art much deeper and his personal works got transformed as well. According to the artist, it was at night in a small and classroom that he made his personal discovery of cubism. He imagined a fly moving around him and the objects in the room and the movement of this imaginary fly has created a complex network of lines, planes and shapes. In this unusual way, Tobey  has experienced for the first time the interplay of mass and void, which became the essence of his best and most mature paintings. In 1923, Tobey met a young Chinese artist called Teng Kuei, and from him learned the technique of calligraphy that he was already interested in. The knowledge of calligraphic skills has enabled him to discover the power of freely moving brush, which helped him develop his concept of animated space. After working as an art teacher for a while, Tobey has started traveling around the world and he visiting Mexico, Europe, Palestine, Israel, Turkey, and Lebanon, then Persia, Shanghai, and Kyoto, where he visited a cloister and studied Japanese Zen painting, haiku poetry, and calligraphy.   Tobey is most notable for his creation of so-called white writing technique. This style includes an overlay of light-colored calligraphic symbols on an abstract field often composed of thousands of tiny, interconnected brush strokes. This method, in turn, gave rise to the type of all-over painting style, which was promoted by Jackson Pollock, an eminent American painter to whom Tobey is often compared, besides Sam Francis. What I had learned in the Orient had affected more than I realized, Tobey said.In a short, time white writing emerged. I had a totally new conception of painting. When it comes to his interpretation of this approach,  Tobey was known to place very light calligraphic marks and symbols on the top of a darker abstract background, creating  a strong and dynamic contrast.  In 1944, the artist had his first solo show at the Willard Gallery in New York, and a couple of years later, in 1951, he had another show at the prestigious  Whitney Museum of American Art. This exhibition was incredibly successful and it traveled to San Francisco, Seattle, and Santa Barbara afterward.   Soon after his successful shows throughout the United States, Tobey became internationally recognized. In 1959 and 1964 he participated in exhibitions in Kassel, Germany. Eventually, he decided to move to Switzerland and he lived in Basel until his death in 1976. Since then, Tobey has had many retrospectives at the Smithsonian Museum and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., as well as at the Museum Folkwang in Essen, Germany, and the Foundation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland.  Four of his signed lithographs are showcased at the reception hall in the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, which is the main institution of the Bahá'í Faith that Tobey belonged to throughout his lifetime.   Nowadays, in the 21st century, Mark Tobey is recognized as one of the key figures of abstract expressionism. His unique calligraphic markings and his invention of white writing were very unexpected elements introduced to this specific movement in expressionism. Also, his work stands apart from the other pieces of the same genre because of their delicacy and philosophical depth. Tobey has portrayed an intricate feeling of silence and emptiness in his abstract works, which represents a mysterious bridge between the ancient Eastern and modern Western cultures. Mark Tobey lived between the United States and Switzerland. ",900
Carmen Herrera,"My quest is for the simplest of pictorial resolutions. This was an answer from a Cuban painter Carmen Herrera when she was asked to explain what drives her art from within. This master of terse lines and contrasting chromatic planes finds the core of her painting within the formal simplicity and a striking sense of color. Herrera's life and career were a long journey filled with adventure and creative development. She exhibited alongside Theo van Doesburg, Max Bill and Piet Mondrian, as well as a younger generation of Latin American authors, such as members of the Venezuelan Los Disidentes, Brazilian Concretists and the Argentinian Grupo Madi[1]. Her work can also be connected with the painters from the US school such as Barnett Newman, Leon Polk Smith and Ellsworth Kelly, at least on a conceptual level.  Carmen Herrera was born during the year of 1915, in Havana, Cuba’s capital city. She was one of seven children of her family. Her father was a successful journalist and one of the founding editors of the newspaper El Mundo, a magazine for which Carmen's mother worked as well. After entering her teens, young Herrera moved frequently throughout the 1930s and 1940s, visiting many world centers, traveling and living in France, Cuba and the United States of America. During that time, she studied architecture in Havana and dreamed of projecting impressive building when she enters adulthood. In 1939, she met an English professor named Jesse Loewenthal when he was visiting from Cuba. The two fell in love and married rather quickly, after which Carmen Herrera moved to New York, abandoning her degree course and dreams of becoming an architect. Instead, the young painter studied at the Art Students League in New York City. During the late 1940s, abstract expressionism was blooming and literally transformed the Big Apple into an art metropolis. However, despite the fact Herrera was an aspiring painter and all the opportunities that the current location could offer her, she decided to move to the post-war torn France. She settled in Paris and became a part of the creative rebuilding era, during which she was able to find her own expressive style. Carmen got to know the young painters from the famed Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, an art collective that was striving to challenge the traditions of the art scene and impose their own avant-garde concepts to the scene. After one of Salon des Réalités Nouvelles' exhibitions, Herrera concluded that her compositions simply have too many elements within them and that she must search for more simplicity. This will eventually prove to be a pivotal moment of her long career that will define all of her future pieces.   Since that key moment in Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, Herrera's art was all about shapes and color from then on. Furthermore, Carmen desired to investigate how such simple elements can relate and correspond with one another. In 1954, the minimalistic painter saw enough of France and wanted to return to her husband. Herrera settled in her home in New York the same year and was a part of the scene constantly. However, she was only an observer and a familiar face, never presenting her own works to the wider public for some reason. As the decades were passing by, literally everyone who knew her talent died and Carmen's art was forgotten in accordance with her wishes. She painted alone in her studio and did not desire fame for most of her mature life, only wanting to develop her purification process further. Luckily for the public, this all changed in the year of 2004 when her friend attended a dinner with Frederico Sève, the owner of the Latin Collector Gallery in Manhattan[2]. After hearing about Herrera's life and work, Sève immediately decided to include the Cuban painter's pieces in his gallery. The 2004 re-discovery of Carmen Herrera was an instant shock wave for the worldwide scene as her brilliance was finally brought to light after all the decades and the public realized just how much she must have influenced the Minimalistic movement. Since her work remained unknown for so many years, Herrera's career managed to add many noteworthy chapters to the development of contemporary art. Fortunately, Carmen's art is now finally and rightfully considered to be an important milestone in the evolution of the Geometric Minimalism movement. Whitney Museum of American Art in New York was especially interested in her paintings, holding at least one exhibition of Herrera's work annually to date. Soon, her paintings were a part of many galleries around the world and every painting she authored found a home either in Paris, London or in the aforementioned Whitney Museum. Her fascinating life story became an instant magnet for her exhibitions, while the unique circumstances of Herrera's paintings were crowned with a 2014 documentary film by a famous director Alison Klayman, titled appropriately as The 100 Years Show.   Observing her work is simply astonishing, especially when you consider that her pieces have been in hiding for at least five decades prior to 2004. Carmen Herrera was able to simultaneously create harmony, asymmetry and an endless diversity of movements, rhythms and spatial tensions across her canvases by using nothing more than the most inconspicuous application of paint. The artist ultimately managed to do what she desired for the majority of her life - to achieve the perfect purification and remove everything nonessential from her visual vocabulary[3]. And as a reward for such an impressive achievement, Carmen Herrera's name will go down in art history and her quiet but steady work will forever be a perfect example of a cross-cultural dialogue within the international history of modernist abstraction.

Lucien Clergue,"Lucien Clergue was a filmmaker, author, and photographer known for his masterful compositions and innovative use of light and shadow. His work has been associated with some of France's most significant artists, intellectuals, and musicians including Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Roland Barthes, and the Gypsy Kings. Lucien Clergue was born on 14 August 1934 in the coastal town of Arles, Provence, and has lived there ever since. The only son of shop owners, Clergue's early life was interrupted by the experience of poverty and destruction brought on by the war years. In 1952, at the age of 18, he was faced with the untimely death of his mother. Clergue channeled his energies into shooting photographs with a box camera his mother had gifted him a few years before her passing. Lucien Clergue first discovered the power of the camera in his difficult adolescence. He witnessed the destruction of his family's house by WWII bombsHe has spent much of his career taking photos that express loss, death and decay. He is known for his female nude torsos from the mid '50s - '70s and bullfight images from the Arles arena, where he met Pablo Picasso, a strong supporter of his early work. His later work turned to organic abstractions of sand, lace, etc. His work has been influenced by mythology, adventure and what he calls ""the mentality of the Mediterranean man. In the 1960's, he became increasingly involved in filmmaking, producing dozens of films over the course of his career, and was nominated for an Academy Award for his documentary Delta del Sel in 1967. In addition, he traveled to the United States for the first time in 1961, where he was deeply influenced by the American landscape and the photographs of artists such as Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. In addition, his time spent in the US inspired Clergue to establish the Arles Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie, a festival held in Arles incorporating theater, dance, music, and art, and which played an important role in establishing France’s prominence in the global photography market. In 2003 he was given the famous Legion D'Honneur, and then in 2006 he was elected as a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts de l'Institut de France, the first photographer to be given the honor. His photographs are held in museums around the world, and he has published over 75 books. Lucien Clergue passed away in 2014 at the age of 80 in Nîmes.

Frederic Prat,"Frédéric Prat is a French contemporary artist known for his abstract paintings with monochrome backgrounds and luminous acrylic forms. Born in 1966 in France, Prat studied with the artists Joel Kermarrec, Toni Grand, and Claude Viallat at Ecole Nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris where he graduated in 1991.   Without connection or allusion to the external world, Frédéric Prat’s oeuvre is strictly non-figurative. His work is shaped by the Supports-Surfaces movement established in Nice, France, in the early 1970s which has developed a new artistic approaches based on the belief that art should refer to itself rather than history or real-life events. Frédéric Prat uses the canvas, the colour, and the design, as the themes of his work rather than just the means of representation. He is influenced by the work of abstract expressionists Barnett Newman, Willem de Kooning and Ad Reinhardt, whose paintings function as cohesive whole objects and represents what Frédéric calls “truth” in art.  After he had made numerous oil paintings, Frédéric Prat evolved to acrylic, using it exclusively since 2005. His large-scale, abstract works on canvas or paper emphasizing the relationships between color, surface, and line without representation of any expression. In his latest works, he covers canvases with larges convolutions of colors showing unity and plurality of the object.

Max Ernst,"One of the most recognized artists of the twentieth century Max Ernst was a proponent of Dada and one of the founding members of Surrealism. Born in Germany, but spent the greatest part of his life in France, Ernst was also one of the first artists to apply Sigmund Freud’s methods in his practice. Influenced by philosophy, literature and psychoanalytic, his practice was always closely bound to technical experimentation, from his first collages through the development of such techniques as frottage, grattage, and decalomania. One of the most common symbols in his strange, evocative paintings, drawings and sculptures is a birdlike creature called Loplop.   Max Ernst was born in a middle-class Catholic family, in the spring of 1891 in Brühl, a town in the Rhineland of Germany. He was the oldest son and the third of nine children of Louise Ernst, née Kopp, and Phillip Joseph Ernst. His father was a teacher at Brühl's Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and an amateur painter who had a reputation for being a strong disciplinarian. Max was encouraged by his father's interest in art to take up painting himself at an early age. Ernst’s memories of his childhood at family home were significantly dynamic and picturesque, and they provided him with many subjects for his later oeuvre. Max received no formal artistic education, instead, he enrolled at the University of Bonn in 1910, where he studied philosophy and abnormal psychology, which also influenced his later work. During his studies, Ernst visited asylums and became interested in the art of the mentally ill as a means to access primal emotion and unconstrained imagination. Focused on courses in the history of art, psychology, philosophy, philology, and literature, the artist became increasingly preoccupied with painting in 1910, producing sketches in an idyllic garden landscape at the Bruhl castle, as well as the self-portraits and portraits of his sister. In 1914, he completed his studies and decided to devote himself to art.   In 1911, Max Ernst met August Macke, an expressionist painter and one of the leading members of the Die Rheinischen Expressionisten (The Rhineland Expressionists) group of artists. Max, who became a friend of Macke, became actively engaged with the group of artists and began writing art criticism for the newspaper Volksmund in Bonn. A year later, Ernst visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne and was influenced by the paintings of Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Edvard Munch and Vincent van Gogh. In 1912, Ernst exhibited his work for the first time with The Rhineland Expressionists, as well as at the First German Autumn Salon at Herwarth Walden's Sturm Gallery in Berlin. In 1913, he participated in several collective shows. The same year Ernst met French artists Guillaume Apollinaire and Robert Delaunay and traveled to Paris. In 1914, Ernst met a German-French multidisciplinary artist Jean Arp in Cologne. The two befriended and their meaningful artistic friendship lasted for five decades.  Max Ernst was drafted and served in the German army during the Great War both on the Western and the Eastern front. Upon his return from World War I in 1918, Ernst began to develop his own unique and inimitable style convinced that the traditional approach to art was no longer up-to-date. One year later, Ernst visited a Swiss-German painter Paul Klee in Munich and studied pieces by the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico which profoundly influenced the surrealists. The same year, Max Ernst made his first collages, a technique of an art production where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, which would become one of the main technique in Ernst’s practice in the following years.   In 1919, Ernst, Arp, social activist and artist Johannes Theodor Baargeld (Alfred Emanuel Ferdinand Grünwald), and several colleagues founded the Cologne Dada group. Dada or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century which dealt with the nullification and mockery of the established world. It was the precursor to the Surrealist movement. From 1919 to 1920, members of the Cologne Dada group published various Dadaist publications including Der Strom and die Schammade. In 1920, Ernst, Baargeld, and Arp organized a controversial Dada exhibition which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments. Held in a public restroom, the show was closed by the police due to obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped. One of Ernst’s Dada collages and photomontages produced in this period was Here Everything Is Still Floating (1920) made of cutout photographs of insects, fish, and anatomical drawings ingeniously arranged to suggest the multiple identities of the things depicted. He made a series of collages using school textbooks, educational placards and mail-order catalogs as the main sources of materials to form bizarre juxtapositions of images.    After demobilization in 1918, Max Ernst married art history student Luise Straus, whom he had met in 1914. They got a son Ulrich ""Jimmy"" Ernst on 24 June 1920, but their marriage ended in 1922 when Ernst moved to Paris and left behind his wife and son. Before long, the artist became a friend of a French artist André Breton, who organized an exhibition of Max's collages at the Galerie Au sans Pareil, Paris in 1921. With Breton and another French artist Paul Éluard, he was involved in Surrealist activities. In 1922, Ernst entered France illegally after failing to get the required documents. In the suburb of French capital Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, Max Ernst settled into a ménage à trois with Paul Éluard and his wife Gala. The same year he painted A Friends' Reunion, where he depicted himself and all his associates. In his works from that period, Ernst combined painting, assemblage and collage in large-scale pieces with enigmatic plots like in Oedipus Rex (1922) and Teetering Woman (1923). For a brief period in 1924, Max, Gala, and Paul visited Monaco and Saigon, a city in southern Vietnam, where they decided that Gala would remain with Paul, so the German painter returned to Paris and opened a studio a year later at 22, rue Tourlaque. The same year Max Ernst became one of the founding members of the Surrealist group. In 1927, he married Marie-Berthe Aurenche, the sister of movie writer Jean Aurenche.   In 1925, Max Ernst discovered the technique frottage. It is a method of creation in which one takes a pencil or other drawing tool and makes a ""rubbing"" over a textured surface. The drawing can either be left as it is or used as the basis for further refinement. Ernst’s series of frottages was published in his book Histoire Naturelle in 1926. With Joan Miró’s help, Ernst employed the grattage, a technique in painting in which (usually wet) paint is scraped off the canvas. His most famous painting in which he used the grattage is Forest and Dove that depicts a nocturnal scene of a forest of bizarre, abstract trees. One more technique Ernst explored was decalcomania, a decorative technique by which engravings and prints may be transferred to pottery or other materials.   Some of the most common symbols in the painter’s oeuvre are forests and doves as well as a fantasy birdlike creature called Loplop. It appears in collages of Ernst's work, such as Loplop presents André Breton, and it is also used as a form of narration and self-commentary like in Ernst’s books of collages La Femme 100 têtes and Une Semaine de bonté, both produced between 1929 and 1939. The artist in the shape of Loplop appeared in his works in person, either in a caption or pictorial form, throughout his life, like in painting Loplop Introduces a Young Girl (1930) and Loplop Introduces Loplop (1930). The following year the artist collaborated with a prominent Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dalí and appeared in the 1930 film L'Âge d'Or, directed by self-identifying Surrealist Luis Buñuel. Ernst’s first solo show in the United States was held at the Julien Levy Gallery, New York in 1932. Max Ernst made his first sculpture in 1934 using improvised techniques in this medium just as he had in painting.   In 1936, Ernst divorced Marie-Berthe Aurenche. Subsequently, he left the Surrealist group and went to Saint-Martin d’Ardèche, Southern France, with his lover, the artist Leonora Carrington. They supported each other’s artistic talent and vision and collaborated on several projects until Ernst’s arrest by the Nazis shortly after their occupation of France. Thanks to the intercession of Paul Éluard and several other friends, he was released a few weeks later. In 1938 the American art collector, Marguerite ""Peggy"" Guggenheim acquired a number of Max Ernst's works, which she displayed in her new gallery in London, UK. In 1941, Peggy helped him to escape to the USA. He left behind his lover, Leonora Carrington who suffered a complete breakdown that resulted in her being institutionalized. Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim married in December 1941.    From 1941 to 1945 Max Ernst lived in New York where together with other European emigrant painters, including Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall, helped inspire the development of Abstract expressionism and left a lasting influence on the development of American modern art. His works made in the USA reflect in a surrealistic manner the tragic social reality. In October 1946, Ernst married fellow Surrealist Dorothea Tanning. From 1946 to 1952, they lived in Arizona, where Ernst got interested in sculpture and made many pieces mainly consisted of assembled objects of everyday use. In 1948, Ernst wrote the treatise Beyond Painting.    One of the most important figures in the European avant-garde in the years after World War I, Max Ernst continued to produce innovative work in his late years. He experimented with numerous of the themes that had preoccupied him in the United States after his return to France in 1953. One year later Ernst participated at the Venice Biennale where he won the Grand Prize for painting, one of the art world’s top honors for painting. He became a French citizen in 1958. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum gave him a major retrospective in 1975, which traveled in modified form to the Musée National d’Art Moderne, Paris. The artist died on April 1, 1976, just a day before his 85th birthday. In the following years, his work continues to receive acclaim. Today, he is recognized as one of the Germany’s most important artists of the last century.   ",904
Leonor Fini,"One of the most famous female Surrealist artists is the Argentinian painter Leonor Fini. Her extensive oeuvre included painting, illustrations, graphic design, and costume and set designs for numerous theatre and movie productions. Fini is considered one of the most important artists of the 20th century, along with Dorothea Tanning, Frida Kahlo, and Remedios Varo. Throughout her long carrier, Fini focused on depicting strong females, mythological beings, dreams, and eroticism. Today the artist’s work can be found in the numerous private and public collections, including the TATE Museum in London, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.   Leonor Fini was born in Buenos Aires in 1907 but grew up in Trieste, Italy, with her strong-willed mother. The artist was fascinated with death from an early age and frequently visited the local morgue. There she learned the anatomy of the human body by making drawings of the recently deceased. Also, she studied the Italian Mannerist painters and their characteristic elongated forms. But it was only after a brief illness where she lost her eyesight that she fully dedicated herself to artistic pursuit. From Trieste Fini moved to Milan and later to Paris, where her flamboyant persona and eccentric lifestyle instantly put her in the spotlight. In a short time, she became friends with several leading artists and writers, such as Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, and Paul Eluard. André Breton was the only artist Fini often clashed with due to his misogynic views about women.     Fini’s first solo exhibition in Milan (1929) was a complete success, after which the artist received numerous commissions. Throughout her career, she refused to be called the ""woman painter"" or a surrealist, fighting in her own way for the rights of female artists that were often overlooked. Unlike Dorothea Tanning’s explorations of first childhood encounters with sexuality, Fini unabashedly dwelled deep into adult eroticism. Often she saw herself as the embodiment of a Sphinx, which is sometimes depicted as benevolent and other times as deadly. This mythological creature was the embodiment of the artist's love for nature and artifice combined. Fini was completely free and apologetic about her sexual freedom and experimentation, which was such a large inspiration for her work. She often portrayed women as mythological beings with elongated forms and androgynous features. It was her way of protesting how her contemporaries depicted women as fragile and shy. Later the artist evolved and began drawing women as goddesses completely above any definition or characterization.     Besides painting, Fini also designed costumes for several theater and movie productions, including Federico Fellini’s film 8 ½ and Renato Castellani's Romeo and Juliet. She illustrated books for several poets and novelists, including the 19th-century erotic works by Marquis de Sade. Fini featured in the famous surrealist exhibition titled Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism (1936) at the Museum of Modern Art. The artist also participated several times in the São Paulo Biennial and the Venice Biennale.  Leonor Fini passed away in 1996 in Paris, France.

Wim Delvoye,"Through shocking, intriguing, and entertaining installations, sculptures, and drawings, Belgian artist Wim Delvoye explores the conventions of propriety and taste. His eclectic and avant-garde approach to artmaking always oscillates with contrasting realms, such as global and local or profane and sacred. Delvoye's work brazenly confronts modern society's various deeply rooted myths through unexpected hybridizations. The artist has had numerous solo exhibitions throughout his career, including those held at the Musée du Louvre and the Musee Rodin in Paris; the Musée d'Art Contemporain in Lyon; the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels; and the New Museum of Contemporary Art, in New York. Today his work is part of several international collections, including the S.M.A.K. Museum of Contemporary Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Louvre, and the Stedelijk Museum.   Wim Delvoye (born in 1965 in Wervik, Belgium) did not grow up in a religious family but was influenced by Catholic architecture from an early age. Early on, while studying at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent, he achieved complete artistic freedom realizing he ""had nothing to lose"". From then on, he began experimenting with the existing patterns via which he defied the conventional tendency towards free expression. One of the pieces that won him international recognition was a glass tile installation titled Mosaic (1990-92) at Documenta IX, featuring photos of the artist's excrement. The artist skillfully combines high technology with craftsmanship, creating works that elude definitive categorization attempts. Delvoye said:   One of Delvoye's best-known works, Cloaca, took eight years of research to realize. To create a fully functioning digestive machine, the artist extensively investigated various fields, including gastroenterology and plumbing. Once finished, Cloaca was able to digest food and produce realistic excrement, which the artist collected and sold as artwork. For years Delvoye refused to allow the installation to be exhibited in museums and galleries. Any kind of presentation that would serve a purpose and give meaning to an artwork that is supposed to be useless, completely destroyed its value. For Delvoye, the definition of art is uselessness, and ""anything useless is art"".   In 1997 Delvoye began tattooing live pigs, firstly in the United States and later in 2004 at an Art Farm in China. The humane process, in which the animals were sedated and shaved, included permanently drawing a diverse array of designs, including Louis Vuitton designs, skulls, and crosses. For the artist, the marking of the pigs raised their market value, allowing them to grow the same way a piggy bank does. Delvoye lives and works in Brighton, England. ",906
Jonas Wood,"Drawings and prints of American contemporary artist Jonas Wood are filled with plant life, basketball and ceramics, and landscapes. Inspired by people, interiors, and objects that surround him, as well as memory and art history, the artist creates artworks of detailed patterns and bright colors. Today, Wood’s paintings can go up to seven-figure prices. The artist has exhibited all around the world, including Tokyo, Los Angeles, Beirut, New York, and Hong Kong. His works are part of numerous private and public collections such as the Museum of Modern Art, Hammer Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.   Jonas Wood (1977) grew up in Boston surrounded by art that made quite an impact on a young mind. His grandfather had an extensive art collection that included artworks from some of the well-known masters such as Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon, Jim Dine, Larry Rivers, and Alexander Calder. Wood was interested in both the mind and the art, so it is no surprise that he graduated with BA in psychology and studio art from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in New York. Early on, he began experimenting with collage by using personal photographs of himself and his friends. Unlike his later works, these had quite a darker quality that has since then softened out. After college, Wood went on to study at the University of Washington, Seattle (2002), where he received an MFA in painting and drawing.   Wood’s possesses a unique style of composition where depicted objects have their own self-contained images. A single frame encompasses a perfectly balanced picture-within-picture composition. Inspired by works by Alex Katz, David Hockney, and Henri Matisse, the artist creates paintings that mix drawings, photographs, and collage studies that have layers of patterns, colors, and geometry. Wood works in tandem with his wife, Shio Kusaka, at their shared studio. They inspire each other, and the motifs that one would use often migrate to the other ones' work, from Kusaka’s ceramics to Wood’s paintings and vise versa. Also, they draw inspiration from their personal art collection that includes works by Magdalena Suarez Frimkess, Alighiero Boetti, Ed Ruscha, and Mark Grotjahn.   Wood’s first solo exhibition at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles in 2010 was a huge success and resulted in a number of commissions, including the Still Life with Two Owls (MOCA), 2016 for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Shelf Still Life, 2014 for the High Line, New York. The artist often creates a series that fallow a subject matter that interests him, like for example the Pots done in 2015. A series of paintings that depict vessels containing images from art history. Also, for the series titled Clippings (2017), he created paintings of leaves, flowers, and stems. In honor of his exceptional talent, the Dallas Museum of Art held a retrospective of his works in 2019. Jonas Wood lives and works in Los Angeles, California.

Aaron Wexler,"Aaron Wexler, born in 1974, is an American artist who makes layered acrylic and paper collages on surfaces of panel and paper. His work features a mixture of figurative and abstract imagery, and real and imagined spaces. Wexler received his MFA in painting and drawing from The School of The Art Institute of Chicago in 1999.",908
Hernan Bas,"American painter Hernan Bas was born in 1978 in Miami, Florida. His outstandingly unique oeuvre is renowned for his expressionist figurative paintings that are inspired by history, contemporary culture, and literature of Oscar Wilde, Robert Frost, and Arthur Rimbaud. In the artist's work, there are ever-present themes of supernatural and male beauty. His subjects are idealized handsome, effeminate men lounging in lavish settings. Besides paintings, Bas has also ventured into the field of film and photography.   The artist often depicts nineteenth-century dandy figures of men. They are beautiful, magical, and androgynous yet void of any emotion. Bas brilliantly explores a narrative of a young man’s adolescent exploration and sexual and sensual awakening. Growing up in Florida in the 1980s and 1990s, the artist was surrounded by the vanity of the idealized male bodies. Even though the paintings are a glimpse into Bas’s inner world of fantasy and mythology, they are a result of extensive research. He draws inspiration from books, men's fashion magazines, and Boy Scout manuals and combines them with elements of occult and legends. The artist often combines linoleum print, airbrush woodcut, and gold leaf painting, creating multilayered works. Bas’s oeuvre is by no means just a simple and superficial aesthetic exploration of a male form.   Hernan Bas’s childhood was filled with magical and otherworldly. He often describes his early life as being inside the X-Files, spooky and full of paranormal. The sightings of Big Foot, ghost, and U.F.O. became normal occurrences that left a permanent mark that influenced his future artistic expression. From an early age, Bas would spend hours drawing and imagining the fantastical, almost utopian settings, thus he felt he had nothing left to learn from formal education. Bas graduated from New World School of Arts in Miami in 1996 however, he decided to leave Cooper Union after the first semester. Bas did numerous exhibitions, but the one that launched his career was Making Art in Miami: Travels in Hyperreality in 2000 at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Miami. From then on, his work has appeared in a number of group and solo exhibits including Saatchi Gallery, London, Kunstverein Hannover, and the 53rd Venice Biennale.   Bas dwells deep into the topics that are most relevant today, such as LGBTQIA+ activism, news, politics, desire, and conspiracy theories. Bas said: The work offers space for critical reflection on American contemporary society and its subculture. In a way, they are historic paintings that show the world today filled with seemingly inconsequential moments. His artwork is part of a number of collections, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. Hernan Bas lives and works in Detroit, MI.  ",909
Julian Stanczak,"A Poland-born American artist, Julian Stanczak explored the visual, psychological, and emotional resonance of color in his Op art paintings. Using art as an exploration of what it is to see, he fused many colorants and their gradations into a single color experience. Born in Borownica, Poland, Stanczak moved to the United States in 1950. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Cleveland Institute of Art, Cleveland Ohio in 1954, and then trained under Josef Albers and Conrad Marca-Relli at the Yale University, School of Art and Architecture, New Haven, where he received his Master of Fine Arts in 1956. The Op Art movement was named after his first major show, Julian Stanczak: Optical Paintings, held at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York in 1964. Using vibratory lines and complimentary color schemes, Stanczak created sophisticated optical effects in his works, blurring precise geometric elements by layers of transparent color. He built his entire career around seeking answers to questions about color, light, form and the way the expression of those things affected the human eye and emotions. Through pulsating shapes, glowing colors, and shuffling and dancing vertical lines, his intensely energetic canvases continuously challenged the viewers' perception. ",910
Troy Brauntuch,"Troy Brauntuch is an American contemporary artist, known for his characteristic photo-based works and paintings created with Conté crayon on dark cotton. As a member of the Pictures Generation, the artist showed with contemporaries Jack Goldstein, Robert Longo, and Sherrie Levine in the pivotal 1977 Pictures exhibition. Born 1954 in Jersey City, New Jersey, Brauntuch currently lives in Austin, Texas. He graduated from California Institute of the Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1975. Brauntuch has exhibited his art work at the 2006 Whitney Biennial, and in 2000 at the Modern Art Despite Modernism exhibit at The Museum of Modern Art. His work was in two group shows in 1982: documenta 7, Kassel and the Venice Biennale. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including Guggenheim Fellowship (2010), National Endowment for the Arts Grants and Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant (1999). He was Adjunct Professor at Columbia University and teaches at the University of Texas. Over the last four decades, Brauntuch's practice has drawn from a breadth of sources, such as newspapers, television and cinema. These elements are then assimilated on black cotton or paper through di erent reproduction techniques such as industrial letterpress printing and traditional photographic processes. He also creates ghost-like traces of images with light pastels and dark pigment.",911
James Brown,"James Brown was an American painter, who shared the name with the famous American singer and dancer. He was born in Los Angeles in 1951, and lived and worked both in Paris and Oaxaca, Mexico. The style of his works changed throughout the years, but it was always influenced by motifs from tribal art and modernist tradition. During the 1980s he shared similar views with Jean-Michel Basquiat and the young Neo-expressionist from East Village, which helped him gain the interest of art public.  Brown received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from Immaculate Heart College in California in 1972, and decided to continue his art education in Paris, France, at the Ecole Superieure des Beaux Arts. Although unhappy with the training he received in Paris, he stayed in Europe and incorporated European influences into his work. In 1980s he started exhibiting in New York. His works, based on European modernism and primitive art, and resembling the East Village painting, became quite popular.   In 1995, he moved with his family to the valley of Oaxaca in Mexico, where he started making old-fashioned, traditional Mexican rugs, and founded Carpe Diem Press together with his wife. The Carpe Diem Press books are printed in limited editions, using traditional Oaxaca methods, usually in collaboration with other artists.  James Brown's work has been exhibiting in the numerous prestigious galleries across the United States, Europe and Mexico since 1980s. Some of his works can be found in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He died in 2020 at the age of 68. All images copyright © the artist",912
Vincent Abadie Hafez,"Vincent Abadie Hafez also known as Zepha is a French contemporary artist whose work is strongly inspired by traditional and contemporary Arabic calligraphy. He is widely known for his highly ornamental and completely stunning artworks. Famous for employing a wide variety of mediums and techniques, he tries to bring entirely separate worlds together in his work, to merge the ancient with the new, to bring the East closer to the West.  Born in Paris in 1977, he became active in the graffiti and street art scene working under the pseudonym Zepha in the late 1980s. His long-lasting, continuous and engaged involvement in the graffiti movement has allowed him to work in depth on the subversion and stylization of the Latin alphabet.  He has developed his own unique style on the edge between the graffiti and calligraphy and a world in which cross the craftsmanship of ancient civilizations, the movement Figuration, Abstraction lyrical and street art. Brave and open mind, his artistic production evolves by borrowing diverse ways most of the time through not beaten paths at the crossroads of two worlds, ancient and modern. Contrasts and complementarity are his driving force, visible in every aspect of his work, from the choice of medium or technique (he dabbles in street art, while also painting on canvas, his works include calligraphy, murals, etching and engraving...) to the themes of his pieces, in which he tries to bring peace to the chaos of opposing ideas.  The gesture intrinsic to the aerosol technique and the energy of calligraphic gestures led him to live creativity as a process, not only as a goal. Zepha’s art is accessible to all, and poses questions fundamental to every human – he reminds us of our beginnings, questions the consequences of our actions, both as individuals and on a global scale, and rebels against over-urbanization.  His work has been featured in Arabic Graffiti, a book by Don Stone Karl and Pascal Zoghbi, which presents the beautiful fusion of traditional Arabic calligraphy styles and modern graffiti techniques. Amongst Zepha, the book includes the artwork and thoughts of Hassan Massoudy, eL Seed, L’ATLAS, Typism, and many more.  Vincent Abadie Hafez has participated in many exhibitions and art festival worldwide, including in France, Germany, Morocco, Spain, Liban, Switzerland, Qatar and Tunisia. In May 2015, his art was included in group show Concrete Alphabets at 886 Geary Gallery in San Francisco. He is represented by BC Gallery in Berlin, Germany and David Bloch Gallery in Marrakech, Morocco.    All Images Courtesy © Vincent Abadie Hafez",913
The Connor Brothers,"Mills & Boon romantic novels about relationships between men and women give the readers an easy, thrilling fictional adventure - with a guaranteed happy ending. Widely known for their characteristic cover, these novels take the readers into a fantasy world of intrigue, danger, passion and romance. However, their iconic covers are not only the preview of what's under them but also a source of inspiration for an artistic duo known as the Connor Brothers. Composed of Mike Snelle and James Golding, the artistic collaboration became internationally famous for their satirical reinterpretations of Mills & Boon book covers and cynical view of the contemporary culture. The artists explore the concepts of truth and fiction, often blurring the line between the two and raising questions about the process by which people turn the experience into meaning.    The Connor Brothers first entered the art scene as American twins Franklyn and Brendan Connor brought up within a pseudo-Christian cult known as The Family whose leader, David Berg, preached and practiced a fanatical, perverse form of Christianity. At the age of 16, they escaped to New York where they developed a methodology to understanding the outside world, wherein they would each explore their surroundings and share their discoveries with each other through their notebooks and sketchpads. It was by this process that the Connor brothers began creating their artworks together. The duo sold out at the London 14 Art Fair and exhibitions in Sydney and Los Angeles and set an auction record at Bonhams in London. However, in October 2014, they confessed their backstory was a fabrication and art dealers Mike Snelle and James Golding exposed themselves as the Connor Brothers. The revelation of their identity has seen a huge increase in sales with their works having been sold alongside the such legends as Banksy and Damien Hirst at Christie's and Bonham's.   The Connor Brothers’ work has been included in many shows at galleries like Pertwee, Anderson & Gold Gallery, London, UK; Art Equity Gallery, Sydney, Australia; Guy Hepner gallery, Los Angeles, CA; Jealous Gallery, London, UK; and Marion Harris Gallery, New York, among others. In July 2015, they participated in a group show entitled Dog Days at London’s Hang-Up gallery. In August 2015, the Conner Brothers launched a fundraising appeal for refugees in the 'Calais Jungle camp'. In order to raise money to provide aid for the people in The Jungle, they issued a limited edition print titled, We Must Be Careful What We Pretend to Be which sold out immediately. They have found Refugee Response Foundation, a charity that builds wooden shelters in the camp. The artists returned to Hang-Up gallery in November 2015 with their solo exhibition entitled So It Goes… Snelle and Golding presented a new body of work from their Pulp Fiction series, alongside an installation which depicted their documented work in the refugee camp in Calais. Nadya Tolokonnikova from the Russian group Pussy Riot gave a brief talk about the refugee crisis at the opening night.  The Connor Brothers embraced the collage technique because the layered, fragmented form allowed them to transform the meaning of vintage romance novels and old master paintings. Their clever and witty pieces are steeped in references to both historical and popular culture and depict an almost anthropological view of modern western society. The goal of their work is to provide a humorous commentary on human obsession with money, beauty, fame, and the unrealistic visions of relationships.   The duo is represented by Hang-Up gallery in London and Guy Hepner in Los Angeles.  ",914
Nicola de Maria,"Nicola de Maria is an Italian painter. He was born in Foglianise, in 1954. He is one of five principal artists of the Italian Transavantgarde movement, along with Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi and Mimmo Paladino.  His work focuses on abstraction and pictorial approach. De Maria lives and works in Turin, Italy.",915
Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada,"One of the building blocks of artistic practice is the fact that it is a form of expression, and artists have been using it to explore the depths of both art and their own self through such display. Some, however, have seen this freedom as fitting for a more practical use, applying its methods to real-life issues. Although it may be confused with artistic appropriation or acts of vandalism, there is no more direct way of opposing consumerist social movements than with “Culture jamming”, and the artist who helped bring it to New York is Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada. With his practice dealing with such, and many other wide-known social questions and concerns, his art speaks to art-lovers as much as those with no interest in it.  Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada faced the ethnic-based social issues even as a child. Having moved from Cuba to the US in 1970, he was one of the first Hispanics to be a part of the New Jersey local schooling system, and he was bullied for it.  He wasn’t alone in this struggle, as many other immigrant children suffered the same daily troubles which influenced his perception on the world as a person and as an artist. This sort of impact can truly affect the forming of person’s identity, and it fascinated Rodriguez-Gerada to the point where he wanted to make a difference. Studying at the Jersey City State College, he met a few like-minded with whom he formed the Artflux group, producing controversial works that targeted social issues.   The group started out with Culture jamming, altering billboards of health-damaging products, like alcohol and cigarettes, which were being presented in disproportional numbers to the public in poor regions. Naturally, the communities targeted by these adverts didn’t like the attempt either and had protested by painting some of the ads in white, but Rodriguez-Gerada sought a more impactful way of getting the message across. They thought of a clever way of solving the issue, and Artflux started using the billboards for ads of their own. By making clever interventions, they would reverse the meaning of the ad while keeping its legitimacy and targeting the same audience the original was meant for. Modifications came in various witty forms: morphing the faces of models on cigarette ads to look diseased, changing the messages to the likes of “Black and Latinos are the prime scapegoats for illegal drugs, and the prime target for legal ones,” among others. They all served the purpose of backlashing the ads against the corporations that produced them, creating a form of dialogue from the marketing instead of a one-way statement with Rodriguez-Gerada’s artistic portrayal. However, the corporations weren’t sitting idle either, and the fame that this movement acquired over time would eventually turn against it.   Rejecting the idea of passively accepting the marketing imposed by the companies simply because it can be found in public spaces, the Culture jamming movement gained popularity not only with the public that observed it but with the press that covered more and more of its appearances. Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada started working more as a solo artist, and had, as such, used the pseudonym Artjammer in his work. He spread his practice to more than just tobacco and alcohol and started covering consumerism as a whole, which led to an even wider success. It came to a point where the acknowledgment the movement received undermined its own purpose and the ads and companies that were covered in this way gained in popularity because of it. Paradoxically, the advertisers themselves would jam their own ads, absorbing the aesthetics of art into their marketing. The movement ended up, in some cases, doing the opposite of what it was created for, and Rodriguez-Gerada had moved on to a different type of art.   Starting out the new century and millennia, Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada began working on his Identity Series in which he merges memory, place and identity. He still remained on the subject of social issues, this time approaching the questions of controlling the public spaces and what kind of a role art plays in it. By depicting a face of a local citizen in an ad-like size and portrayal, the artist probes the “allowance” of art in public domains and whom it is meant for. He keeps his work out of the confines of marketing by drawing them with charcoal, giving them ephemeral and fading properties that negate the imposition of the space itself.  In addition, Rodriguez-Gerada had done a complementary series titled Identity Composite Series that is based on an algorithm performing 3D facial scans in a specific city. Creating a composite face of the demographics, the artist had created Identity Composites for Barcelona in 2009 and Badalona in 2010.   Moving the boundaries of art and presenting social issues on a whole new scale, Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada created some spectacular works since 2008 that are literally so large that they are best viewed from the air, even space. His latest works large enough to be seen via Google Earth, the terrestrial series involves pieces of enormous size like Expectation from 2008, Mama Cash from 2012, Wish from 2013, and others, some of which required 2,000 tons of soil, sand, and enormous amounts of other constructing materials. He keeps all of the pieces ephemeral and their natural composition fades in time, leaving no harmful effects on the land. The artist had used this quality to portray the possible “loss of hope with time” in his Expectation piece alluding to the Hope artwork of President Obama, and all the other works in this series avert attention to current issues on a global scale.   Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada may have started out as an artist and may be considered an artist, but his artwork represents more than just art. Over the years, his work managed to bring people together, create communities that not only point out the issues present in the society but are an example themselves of how they can be solved. His monumental art touches upon the global identity and concerns, representing (quite literally) the reality of our world. The artist is represented by Galerie Mathgoth in Paris, France, N2 Galleria in Barcelona, Spain and St. Art Gallery in Stampersgat, The Netherlands.  ",916

Chen Yiching,"Japanese arts and crafts are well-known for being particularly precise and time-consuming. Nihon-ga, a traditional Japanese painting technique, is a perfect example of such painstaking skill. However, for Chen Yiching, a Taiwanese artist who perfected the art of Nihon-ga, this is a beautiful form of self-expression that requires a zen mind and well-trained, sensitive hands that can carefully handle raw natural materials. Yiching creates paintings which are very subtle and delicate, structured in a puzzling way so that they appeared multi-layered. Her artworks are figurative but still with a pinch of mystery and ambiguity.  All of Yiching's artworks belong to the same genre of an old Japanese painting style. Nihon-ga emerged at the end of the 19th century in Japan, in the Meiji period, which was a decisive period in the history of Japan, when the country's feudal society became modernized. However, this modernisation together with the cultural exchange regarding Western world enhanced the awareness of Japanese identity. Nihon-ga was created as a means of preserving national and cultural tradition. This painting style is easily recognizable for its refined texture and colors made with pulverized precious metals such as gold and silver mixed with strongly pigmented mineral powders. Nihon-ga employs both plant and animal substances and also requires a special binder  made of gelatine, algae or fish cartilage. The binder and the pigments are mixed together and their blend is  diluted with water and applied with brushed to the prepared surface, which can be either silk or wood. Different minerals give different colors - for example, lapis lazuli stone is for blue, oyster shell for white, malachite for green.  Yiching, who has been living in Paris since 2007, discovered the art of Nihon-ga while she was still a student in Japan and instantly fell in love with it. She claims to feel the healing energy of precious minerals and she loves to put a lot of efforts into creating a perfect shade of pigment she needs for her paintings. Even though Yiching's art is clearly traditional, she is not afraid of experimenting and always aims at enriching and improving her current technique. Yiching is highly skilled when it comes to manipulating the thickness of the pigment. Just like digital artists change the opacity of artwork's layers in Photoshop, so is Yiching changing the transparency of various elements on her canvas, by using silver and gold leafs as well as various brushes to enhance or flatten various textures. When it comes to the major topics and common motifs in her work, they are also guided by the Japanese tradition.  Yiching depicts cherry trees with their blooming flowers, autumn leaves, changing of the seasons. Natural cycles are a common theme in Japanese art since they go along with the Buddhist philosophy of accepting the impermanence of things and glorifying the transient beauty of the most fragile forms of life, such as flowers or small animals.   Chen Yiching has received many awards for her work so far, the most important being the Grand Prix of the Shohaku Art Museum. She decided to move to France because of her desire to be closer to the Western art scene. Also, there are not many Nihon-ga painters in Europe, which means that Yiching's presence in Paris is deemed very precious, especially after she has published a book in French on Nihon-ga. Because of Yiching's strong efforts to preserve this unique painting tradition, Nihon-ga is still available to both Eastern and Western art collectors and galleries. The artist is represented by Artistics.  ",919
Jonty Hurwitz,"Always torn between art and physics, Jonty Hurwitz's work takes the context of human perception as the entry point of its aesthetics. Bridging the gap between artistic and scientific, he creates the communion of the two opposites, merging the spiritual and practical through numerous calculations and predictions about unique way in which our mind interprets the spatial information we receive. Starting from mathematical tools, every piece of art goes through months of preparation, until he finds the right manifestation and embodiment of calculated formulae. Using the various mediums, as Perspex, steel, resin, powder, copper, and acrylic, Hurwitz makes each work both and engineering and artistic challenge.  Hurwitz was born in Johannesburg in 1969. He gained his education in Electrical Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand and get the position of the full-time researcher in the Remote Sensing Group at the University of Cape Town. He spent some time traveling India, studying Yoga and wood carving. In 2009, he produced his first sculpture Yoda and the Anamorph and instantly won the People’s Choice award in the Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery Bentliff Prize. Four years later, his anamorphic work was discovered by the art blogger Christopher Jobson and in a few weeks being online, it was estimated that the sculpture received over 20 million views.   The significant body of work makes his anamorphic sculpture inspired by similar work of the some of the most important names in art history, from Leonardo Da Vinci and Hans Holbein, to M.C. Escher. Considered as a pioneer in creating catoptric (mirror) sculptures, Hurwitz explains his ingenuity with calculations and use of algorithm derived from the mathematical constant Pi. The Kiss of Chytrid draws attention to the mass extinction of the frogs because of the spreading of an exotic fungus Chytrid, the artist points out the human superiority in the battle of species on earth.   In 2014, Hurwitz invented a new sculptural technique in the field of Nano art. In a collaboration with the scientific team from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Weizmann Institute of Science, he created the smallest artwork in the world, approximately 300 nanometers big, using the multiphoton lithography and photogrammetry that could be observed only through a non-optical method of magnification like a scanning electron microscope. In 2015, Hurwitz’s sculpture Trust was declared as the Smallest sculpture of a human by the Guinness Book of Records.   With the rapid development of technology, everything progresses faster that human perception is able to follow and the line between the science and fictional becomes blurred. After scanning the original object, the artist prepares his piece in special 3D and mathematics software that creates proper proportions and distortions that are revealed only through the use of cylindrical mirror that inverses the shapes. Intersecting the realms of both science and art, Hurwitz creates sculptures in order to enter the mind-bending world of illusion.",920
Thilo Heinzmann,"Thilo Heinzmann is a Berlin-based contemporary artist known for his  create his three-dimensional canvases made from unusual materials. Heinzmann was born in 1969 in Berlin, Germany. He studied at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, under Thomas Bayrle. During his studies, he was an assistant in Martin Kippenberger's studio in Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald.

After being a guest professor of painting at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg in Hamburg, he was appointed professor of painting at Universität der Künste in Berlin. Driven by an inquiry into what painting can be today, Heinzmann scrutinizes the medium and its history. Using a series of techniques he developed himself and a range of materials, from chipboard, styrofoam, nail polish, resin, pigment, fur, cotton wool, porcelain, aluminum and hessian, he creates inventive, precise works of powerful tactile qualities, while focusing on the presence each of the pieces create. He has used these media to achieve painterly qualities such as composition, color, and texture within the continuity of the history of the medium of painting while at the same time opening new doors.

Growing up in the pulse of a cosmopolitan city like Las Palmas and its mix of nationalities gave him an early interest in the various countries language and symbols that he uses in his art today.  He works as an artist mostly in mixed media that combines acrylic, oil, tempera, to the praxis of college, it gives life to the artworks with a dreamlike and vibrant scenario. Rhythm, pattern and balance are important in his paintings. Images and text fragments stick out, but don’t give the viewer all information, just like dreams and memories are fragmented and fuzzy, just give a glimpse of what has happened. ",925
Michael Cusack,"Irish-born artist, Michael Cusack, creates abstract paintings that play with perspective through the clever use of colors and shapes. Through earthy, neutral tones and freedom of movement, he can capture and depict nature's beauty with an ever-present hint of homey scenes. Throughout his career, he was awarded multiple awards including, AGNSW, Cité Internationale Des Arts, Paris Residency. Widely admired, his exceptional artworks are part of numerous private collections such as Newcastle Region Art Gallery, Lake Macquarie City Art Gallery, BHP Billiton, Melbourne, and Port Macquarie Museum.   Cusack was born in 1960 in Dublin, Ireland, however, in 1980, he emigrated to Australia, where he graduated from the Hunter Institute of Technology in Newcastle with a degree in Fine Arts. Later he received his master's degree from Queensland College of Art at Griffith University in Brisbane. For 20 years Cusack has been teaching Visual Arts staying through to his ideal that knowledge should be readily available to younger generations. Cusack’s abstract paintings are bursting with the forces of nature constantly struggling. They are emotional and dramatic thanks to the highly physical technique the artist utilizes. However, they are never impulsive, but carefully layered and coaxed into existence. The surfaces are built with color until the final shape is born. Cusack succeeds in perfectly balancing the earthly colors until the illusion of space and depth is achieved. Yet it is the artist's power of movement and gesture that communicate strongly through the brush strokes that breaks and shatters the illusion.   Among the artist that most influenced Michael’s technique and personal style are Richard Diebenkorn, Jonas Wood, Philip Guston, and Jannis Kounellis. Painting such as Four Score (2018) depicts forms that are familiar due to the snips of colors that create the impression of planes. Yet some of the artist paintings do have swatches of bright colors that are interlocking with the ever-present natural tones, as can be seen in the multimedia work titled The other house (2016). Michael Cusack had numerous solo exhibitions that were widely successful and well received. His abstract oeuvre has gained world recognition for its unique style and exceptional technique. Among Cusack’s notable exhibitions are: The Same and the Other, Tweed River Art Gallery, South Murwillumbah (2015), Cité Internationale des Arts, Open Studio, Paris (2014), and An Image seeks an Image, Karen Woodbury Gallery, Melbourne (2016).   Cusack’s work has been part of several group exhibits and was featured in Vogue Living, Art and Australia, Art World, and Elle Decoration UK. His paintings speak directly to something deep within each of us. They transcend human nature and communicate straight with that buried animal part. In his artworks, viewers can feel the strong longing the artist has toward understanding nature itself. Without attempting to conquer it or present it as a tame animal, he strives for that perfect depiction that will wholly show its destructive powers and gentler beauty. Michael Cusack lives and works in Byron Bay, Australia.  ",926

Gunter Damisch,"Gunter Damisch is an Austrian painter who is recognized as a proponent of the 1980s Neue Wilde (Wild Youth) movement in his native country, a response to the German Junge Wilde. This artist expressed himself through other media as well, but he remained most loyal to painterly explorations with colors, space, and inner relations. As a matter of fact, the cosmos in the canvases of Gunter Damisch is based on discrepancies between the big and the small, the macro and the microcosmos, the organic natural forms; his pictorial world is saturated with motifs from a highly individual iconography such as monocellular creatures with unfurling tentacles, crystalline growth forms, and starry sky with its black holes. ",928
Ai Kijima,"Born in 1970 in Tokyo, Japan, Ai Kijima is best known for works that are based on three simple elements: cloth, needle and thread. Describing her works as chaotic collages, Kijima creates amalgamations of found material painstakingly stitched into evocative cross-cultural patchworks. Kijima's love of textiles began at a young age while helping her grandmother create handmade sewn pieces. While studying at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, she discovered the art of quilting fusing it with traditions learned in Japan to create a technique distinctly her own. Kijima's works juxtapose iconic imagery derived from current and recently discarded popular culture with fabrics from his personal collection of vintage kimonos she has carefully compiled over the years from thrift stores and flea markets. Through the practice of quilted collage, she transforms the separate pieces into the context of contemporary pop art. While appropriates the context of these materials, she expands their meaning with nostalgia and humor. Characterized by lush intricacies, these colorful, chaotic fabric collages show that textile artworks can have the force and inventiveness of the most lively paintings. ",929

Forthcoming projects include a permanent new installation for Oxford House, Oxford Street, London (with Great Portland Estates to be unveiled in 2021) and the Harlow Arts Trust, Essex (2021). In his practice, he uses a tool which scratches the surface as if it is guiding a path in the landscape, almost like ploughing a field, or perhaps weaving at the loom. More recently, the artist started working with glass, inspired by his interest in lenses and magnification. Developed from a seemingly simple vocabulary of graphic forms, these works are set in lead and held within a custom made patinated brass frame, inviting the viewer to interact with them. ",930
Raymundo Colares,"Raymundo Colares was a unique artist in the experimental Brazilian art scene of the late 1960s. He combined the formal rigor of the constructivist tradition with the urban and expressive noise of the new figuration and the urgency of pop art. Born 1944 in Grão Mogol, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Colares moved from Grão Mogol to Salvador de Bahia with a scholarship to study engineering. Inspired by the works of Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee, he soon gave up his studies to pursue art. Settling up in Rio de Janeiro in 1965, he enrolled the Escola de Belas Artes the following year, where he met Antonio Dias, Antonio Manuel, Wanda Pimentel and Hélio Oiticica, among others, becoming associated with the Brazilian new figuration. In 1967 he abandoned his studies once again to join artist Ivan Serpa’s independent studio at the Museo de Arte Moderna. It was in this period that he developed a style that would remain his signature for over a decade. After his participation in the landmark exhibition Nova Objetividade Brasilera, he aligned himself with the objectives of the Brazilian avant-garde. Colares is best known for works concerned with representing the dynamism and speed of modern life. These works interpreted visual rhythms related to the movement of vehicles at speed in a large city.

Deliberate and methodical, his process consist of applying thick strokes of oil or silicone onto the surface in pointillist fashion, a single color at a time. Sagerman keeps track of every paint application and every color utilized, documenting each number as he build up his abstract compositions. The works, depending on the scale, can have anywhere from 50 up to 250 different colors. Typically 3-inches thick, the canvases become quasi sculptural in their own right and require a wood panel backing to support the weight of the material.

Laura Kaktina,"Laura Kaktina is a Latvian contemporary artist whose paintings are inspired by zooming in and out of individuality. Believing that “balancing the two perspectives of proximity and remoteness is crucial for sustaining curiosity and equanimity,” she creates two distinct types of works – portraits and landscapes. The “zooming in” is reflected in intimate close-ups of a character’s face, generated by the uniqueness of a sovereign being. On the other hand, when Kaktina “zooms out,” the dreamlike landscapes form in her mind. While all-important in portraits, the person is now reduced to a grain of sand, a small and insignificant part of a greater whole. Its value is not removed; the focus has shifted to a bigger picture of existence that serves as a reminder of something inconceivable. That is how Kaktina’s art became a constant shift between expanding out and focusing in. She attended Janis Rozentals Riga Art High-school, participated in a student exchange program at Plymouth College of Art, UK, and graduated from the painting department at the Art Academy of Latvia. Laura Kaktina lives and works in Riga.",953

Chwast (born 1931 in New York) first came in contact with design while studying at Abraham Lincoln High School thanks to Leon Friend, after which he graduated from Cooper Union with a BA in Fine Arts in 1951. Only 3 years later, together with Reynold Ruffins, Milton Glaser, and Edward Sorel, he founded the Push Pin Studios, which had regular publications of The Push Pin Graphic. The boldly eclectic aesthetic of Push Pin was responsible for reviving styles that, at the time, were considered outdated, such as Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Victorian. Throughout his long career, Chwast collected and experimented with styles, but had no problem discarding them when necessary.

Daniele Buetti,"Daniele Buetti is a Swiss visual artist who expresses himself through different media spanning drawing, sculpture, and photography. Since the 1980s, Buetti has been largely examining the domains of popular culture by constructing simple, yet melancholic narratives centered on the beauty of fashion models. Those sophisticated portraits are intervened upon, and their features are carved with logos of famous brands and sometimes followed by shot messages or the models are found crying the glittering tears. Therefore, Buetti dissects the glitz and the posh of the high gloss covers and reveals the insecurity and anxiety behind the façade. The artist is a steady professor at Kunstakademie Münster, and he lives and works between Münster and Zurich. ",970

His working process starts with drawing to form the “birth point” of his ideas, sculpting intuitively from there. ",973

Manoela Medeiros,"A Brazilian artist, Manoela Medeiros works in sculpture, painting and installations. Using her body as the main instrument in the research process of her work, she tries to address abstractions through questioning time and space.

Medeiros’s work is striking for the subtlety of its relation to space. She works with real fragments of walls, debris collected in abandoned buildings. Through a practice described as an archaeology of a habitat, she makes use of dust and fragments, simultaneously highlighting the presence and absence of successive occupants. These ""movements of space"" seem to want to give material form to a the layers of dust that accumulate over time. ",976

Jan Gulfoss,"Fascinated by nature, Jan Gulfoss is a Dutch explorer, both in terms of arts and science. From an early age, he has continuously observed his environment and attempted to render its images and sounds. He was particularly interested in birds, expressing it through painting and recordings of the spectrum of sound reflected in their song. At the age of sixteen, he moved to the South of France, where he studied Law and Art in Nice. The mid-1970s mark the beginning of a long period of artistic and scientific research and explorations. Around the same time, Gulfoss began to explore new evolving technologies, trying to integrate these into his creative work. Working with 3D applications and a range of sound frequencies, he started creating photographic compositions of animals and various other objects, staged in theatrical settings. A frequent visitor of nature museums, Gulfoss also roams the world in a constant scientific expedition, from the Icelandic glaciers and volcanoes to the hanging monasteries of Bhutan, via the Arctic pole, Tasmania, the Amazon, or Africa. On these trips, he studies the frequencies of Nature and records whale songs, Buddhist monks’ chants, or aboriginal didgeridoo. In 2007, his studio in St. Rémy de Provence burned down completely, and all of his body of creative work and research was lost. The life-changing event ignited a creative spark, leading him on an epic voyage of discovery, inspired by the great explorers of earlier centuries. Revisiting the classic studio portrait, Gulfoss places his model in front of a painted background. The staged photograph appears to show the subject in its natural habitat, revealing the subterfuge only upon closer inspection - a door, a light bulb, a glare on a window, unveil to our subconsciousness the frailty of what we had hoped to see.

She captures a little bit of our essence in each painting.

He founded a graffiti group 156 All Starz, in 1984, with a goal to bring together fellow artists from the streets and help them stay clear of drug use. In 1987 together with the French artist Bando, he relocated to Paris and began creating works on canvas.   While working with the 156 All Starz, specifically his childhood friend White Man, JonOne quickly made a name for himself. His personal style, so different from the conventional figurative graffiti, set him apart from the others. JonOne preferred creating abstract works inspired by the city's energy, colours, and movements. After moving to Paris, the artist's style was not what the French artist expected. JonOne said:   Soon after meeting a fellow artist Cornette de Saint Cyr, JonOne began working on the famed painting titled Hopital Ephemere. Soon after, in 1991, JonOne had his first solo exhibition titled GRAFFITISM at the 45 Gleditsch Gallery in Berlin and took part in the group exhibition Graffiti Paris. What sets JonOne style apart is the constant disregard of the ""rules"" of graffiti. He prefers a freestyle approach, combining a sense of repetition akin to textile patterns and hand-painted aesthetics in his compositions. He creates a distinctively balanced and dynamic visual experience by carefully layering strokes of vibrant colours. In 2021 the artist had several exhibitions, including #21 Spring at the Rasson Art Gallery, Rock! at the PROVOST HACKER Gallery and Heritage at the Museum of Black Civilizations Dakar, Senegal. JonOne lives and works between Paris and New York. Featured image: JonOne - Il faut réagir maintnant, 2019. Print; 80 x 75 x 1 cm. Courtesy Galerie Martine Ehmer  ",1016
Stinkfish,"Always carrying the camera with him, Stinkfish likes to take pictures of the unknown random people that he later transfers into stencils, decorating the old walls around the globe. He became recognizable for his brightly colored portraits of complete strangers displayed on the streets of numerous cities, starting from his hometown Bogotá. Using mostly discarded photographs, the artist reinvents his characters through distinctive expression, giving to their faces a brand new life – with psychedelic themes and elements. Believing that street art holds no limits by giving anyone opportunity to participate, Stinkfish captures the moments of humanity, leaving the interpretation to the public.  Born in Mexico he spent his childhood in Colombia where his parents have migrated. As a child, he used to wonder around the streets of Bogotá, discovering his surroundings. Stinkfish believes that it’s in the human nature to keep trying and intervene on its habitat, leaving some kind of personal mark. For this artist, the street is a space for coexisting and sharing, just to transgress and opt for another form of communication between people. The most important part is the irrelevance of the contemporary society concept where consumerism plays the main role. That is why he had joined a group of individuals with similar philosophy and interests. This group of people was interested in painting the streets illegally, criticizing the commercialization of graffiti by and while doing it. Stinkfish bases his concept of work on the independence which is crucial for the creative form of graffiti. That is why he avoids the collaboration with institutions because as he says, once given the permission to intervene on the street – illegality, the very nature of graffiti is jeopardized. He sees it as an opportunity to transmit a forceful social message like no other: here I am and I exist, painting these streets when I want and how I want. This spontaneous expression, direct and free, is important for understanding a personal memory as well as collective, the one that lives on in the “hoods”, cities and countries, on a larger scale. His stencil beginnings occurred during the 2000-2001, but in 2003 he for the first time made complex work representing John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting the body of his father as the reminiscent of his murder. When he was seventeen, he started to tag Stink and later added the Fish to his name. He explains his choice with the influences of the punk music he listened during that time.      Always in a quest for the perfect location, Stinkfish prefers to be visible, choosing places with a high traffic and walls of a specific texture, old ones with the cracks and moisture. It is also very important to find the appropriate neighborhood, where people live, not the business part of the city. Admiring the several names of the current street artists such as El Mac, Roid, Bastardilla, Nunca, Insa, Katsu, Faile, and Nazza Stencil, among the others, he is not hesitating to admit that he finds the inspiration in the work of his friends Lorenzo, Masnah, Saks, Buytronick, Mecamutanterio, Seimiek, Soft, Anger, Zas, Malk, and Onesto. The artist is represented by BC Gallery, 999 Contemporary, Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art Miami, and Vertical Gallery.   Sources:   ",1017
Claes Oldenburg,"There’s this thing about rulers – their reign must end. No one lives forever, no one possesses an inspiration strong enough to defy time and change. However, when we talk about contemporary Pop Art sculpture, the throne has been reserved for Claes Oldenburg. For the past half a century, his reign has been undisputed, his imagination without limits. Singlehandedly ending the tradition of austere and non-representational sculptures of Abstract Expressionism, he introduced what is now commonly known as Pop Art sculpture. Both the pieces and his own ambition grew over time, but one thing hasn’t changed: he reversed all the traditional relationships between the viewers and objects by presenting seemingly everyday objects on a magnified scale. Suddenly, the audience was no longer dominating the relationship, as the absurdly oversized sculptures threatened to end their existence by devouring them in an instant. We indeed are small, and Oldenburg used his talents to show us the truth, applying his sharp insights on the popular American culture along the way.  The son of Gösta Oldenburg and his wife Sigrid Elisabeth née Lindforss, Claes was born in Stockholm, Sweden.[1] His father was a Swedish diplomat stationed in New York, who got appointed Consul General of Sweden to Chicago in 1936. His parents were already in the USA when they found out they were having a baby. Without knowing where her husband’s next appointment will be, Sigrid insisted that the child should be born in Sweden. Oldenburg first came to the United States when he was six months old, eventually becoming a naturalized citizen in 1953. He studied at the Yale University from 1946-1950, graduating with a degree in English and Art. After leaving Yale in 1950, he went to Chicago, where he was undecided about what to do and took a job with the City News Bureau of Chicago. He was doing that for a year and a half, but it seemed to him that it was a very unidealistic pursuit without any future in it. Since he didn’t want to go into reporting, he resolved to become a professional artist. Oldenburg started a self-educating procedure which lasted from 1951 to 1959, when he first showed his work. For about eight years there was darkness, and he worked relentlessly. During the first three years, he also attended the Art Institute of Chicago whenever he felt he was getting too far on his own. In 1956, the artist returned to New York and continued working on his drawings.[2] Regarding his personal life – Oldenburg had three major relationships in his life. His first wife (from 1960-1970), Patty Mucha, was a constant performer in his happenings and also performed with The Druids. In the period 1969-1977, Oldenburg was involved with Hannah Wilke, a feminist artist and a sculptor. He met his second wife, Coosje Van Bruggen, in 1970, when he had his first major retrospective at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where Bruggen worked as a curator. They collaborated on many pieces before she passed away in 2009. Another eminent art figure came from the Oldenburg family – Claes’ brother Richard E. Oldenburg was director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York for more than twenty years and went on to become chairman of Sotheby's America.   In the years after returning to New York, Oldenburg was mostly interested in the figure. He was never an Abstract painter. After giving it a try at school, he felt he was not inclined that way. His mind was set on something else – a subject matter and what may be called a naturalistic form. In 1958, when he finally found a large enough apartment on the Lower East Side, the artist reverted to figure painting, drawing and painting a lot of figures and nudes.[3] In 1961, he wrote I Am For…, widely considered to be a manifesto, even though the artists disagrees. Through it, Oldenburg asserted his radical artistic position, stating: “I am for an art that is political-erotical-mystical, that does something other than sit on its ass in a museum. I am for an art that grows up not knowing it is art at all, an art given the chance of having a starting point of zero. I am for an art that embroils itself with the everyday crap & still comes out on top. I am for an art that imitates the human, that is comic, if necessary, or violent, or whatever is necessary. I am for all art that takes its form from the lines of life itself, that twists and extends and accumulates and spits and drips, and is heavy and coarse and blunt and sweet and stupid as life itself…”[4] Around that time he emerged as a Pop artist with his “soft” sculptures of quotidian objects. Asked about the lingering criticism towards the American society and its habits, the sculptor said that his procedure is entirely instinctive. Where others speak about contemporary (bad) objects and symbols, Oldenburg is only concerned with the living experience. Naturally, he has thoughts about America and the way of life, but it’s not what he really thinks about. When he starts to work, these types of opinions may start the piece, but by the time he gets to something that matters, they have become generalized into something else. Not limiting his pieces to only one dimension (like the critique), the artist states that art objects should be something unique, but also that every single work should go many ways, all at the same time.    Oldenburg had his first solo show at the Judson Gallery in New York in 1959, which featured figurative drawings and papier-mâché sculptures. When the 60s began, he was already in the process of establishing himself through a series of performances and installations. Some of the first ones, such as The Street (1960), The Store (1961), and Ray Gun Theater (1962) contributed greatly to the emergence of the American Pop Art. While he was in Los Angeles, the artist shifted his focus towards subjects inspired by what he called The Home. The installation Bedroom Ensemble (1963) was quickly followed by performances Autobodys (1963), Gayety (Chicago, 1963), Stars (Washington D.C., 1963), Washes and Moveyhouse (New York, 1965), and Massage (Stockholm, 1966). In 1969, he exhibited his works at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and a year later, at the Tate Gallery in London. The Whitney Museum of American Art organized a retrospective of the drawings made by Oldenburg and Van Bruggen in 2002, and seven years later, another major exhibition took place there. Claes Oldenburg: Early Sculpture, Drawings, and Happenings Films, along with Claes Oldenburg and Coosje Van Bruggen: The Music Room, showed the Iconic examples of Oldenburg's early sculpture - Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato Sandwich) (1963), French Fries and Ketchup (1963), and Soft Toilet (1966).[5] The Music Room was actually a full room dedicated to a series of sculptures of musical instruments by the duo, including both hard and soft instruments of differing scales that ranged in date from 1992 to 2006. Among the objects included were variations on a viola, saxophone, clarinets, French horns, sheet music, and a metronome. Up to this date, Oldenburg remains as one of the most exhibited contemporary artists, whether he’s in solo shows, or participating in group exhibitions. Also, there are more than forty large-scale pieces installed around the world – from Norway, South Korea, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, France, to the USA. His works are admired by the entire world.   Oldenburg made a major breakthrough in the world of sculpture, distancing himself from the aesthetics of Abstract Expressionism and its hard and vertical placed sculptures. His works may appear insignificant, but they are indeed expressive entities. He has also distanced himself from his Pop peers, like Warhol and Lichtenstein, by employing somewhat gentler cynicism. His innovative approach paved the way for the next generation. Oldenburg inspired some of the contemporary titans, such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. In the end, one’s contribution to the world art is not measured by the influence he makes in his own time, but rather can his style survive the test of imminent change and remain influential. This puts Oldenburg in the pantheon of the sculpture deities, along other masters like Brancusi and Michelangelo.  He is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art gallery.  References:  ",1018
Jenny Holzer,"Jenny Holzer is an American conceptual and installation artist who became widely known because of her Truisms series of short aphorisms.  In her insightful art consisting of brief punchlines, Holzer uses the rhetoric and vocabulary of modern information systems and she addresses the latent politics found in these systems. Holzer belongs to the feminist branch of the artists that emerged in the 80s, just like Barbara Kruger and  Cindy Sherman. Similarly to the other artists belonging to this movement, Holzer explores new ways to make narratives using a visual medium.  Holzer was born in Ohio, into a family of two generations of Ford auto dealers. She completed her undergraduate degree at Ohio University in Athens after attending Duke University and the University of Chicago. While enrolled in the Rhode Island School of Design, Holzer experimented with an abstract painting style influenced by the color field painters, such as Mark Rothko. In 1976, she moved to Manhattan, participating in the Whitney Museum's independent study program. After 1976, she started working on innovative projects which combine the use of language, installation, and public art.  In 1977, Holzer began her first truly public project, Truisms. This break-through series consists of provocative one-line aphorisms printed in an italic bold font, confronting the viewer through the unsettling element of truth in each proclamation, such as men are not monogamous by nature and money creates taste. Such concise allegations elicit public discussion, directly engaging viewers in a larger discourse on society that often broaches polemical issues.The medium of modern computer systems became an important component in Holzer's work in 1982 when nine of her Truisms flashed at forty-second intervals on the giant spectacolor electronic signboard in Times Square, New York. Sponsored by the Public Arts Fund program, the use of the L.E.D. (light emitting diode) machine allowed projections of Jenny Holzer's truisms to reach a larger audience. At the same time, she started printing Truisms on posters, T-shirts, and stickers, and she also carved them into benches, which significantly contributed to the public spreading of her artworks.  In 1981, Holzer began working on her Living series. The main topic of this projects are the necessities of daily life, such as eating, breathing, sleeping, but also relationships. The artworks were printed on aluminum and bronze plaques and their short messages were accompanied by paintings of Peter Nadin, whose portraits of people attached to Holzer's messages emphasized the emptiness of both life and communication in the digital age.The multimedia extravaganzas of Holzer's later installations, such as the 1989 Guggenheim exhibition, are exemplified by a 535-foot running electronic signboard spiraled around the core of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture, flashing garish lights on the monumental stone benches arranged in a large circle on the floor below. In 1989 also, she became the first female artist chosen to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale. For the Biennale Holzer designed posters, hats, and t-shirts to be sold in the streets of Venice, while her LED sign boards and marble benches occupied the solemn and austere exhibition space. She received Golden Lion that year, but also made a new series of works, called Laments.This series is inspired by the birth of her first child and it is perhaps the most personal series she has ever had done. Laments is dedicated to an unusual outlook on motherhood, violation, pain, torture, and death.  Holzer withdrew from the art world for a few years and then returned in 1993 with a fresh approach to her work and a new emphasis on the immaterial. In 1993, she partook in a virtual reality exhibit at the Guggenheim Museum. The following year she produced her next series, Lustmord, which opened at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery in New York. Her more recent work, from 2007, called I Was In Baghdad Ochre Fade, is based on the transcriptions of documents from the Iraq War while her Redaction Paintings series from 2008 features declassified memos and much of the text is blacked out and censored. Jenny Holzer has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and Europe and she has also published several books, such as A Little Knowledge (1979), Black Book (1980) and Hotel (1980). She is also well known for her parody Twitter account, which she uses to share parental wisdom in a similar way to her art. When asked about her opinion on her own work, Jenny replied -  If you are an artist and you are honest, you are never good enough.  The main topics of Jenny Holzer's truisms are violence, oppression, sexuality, feminism, power of war and death. The artist is emphasizing and bringing to light important issues of the capitalist society by cleverly commenting on sexual identity, gender relations and a variety of political and existential issues. Her entire work and exhibitions are a unique social critique and protest art which aims at subverting common hierarchy while her main tools playfully visualized linguistic ambiguities. Jenny Holzer remains an active artist whose works are regularly sought when it comes to  modern art marketplace. She is represented by SCAI THE BATHHOUSE Tokyo.  ",1019
Larry Clark,"Larry Clark is an American photographer and filmmaker who is best known for his movies Kids (1995) and Ken Park (2002) and photo series called Skaters, featured the skateboarding subculture of the early 1990s. His mother was a baby photographer, and he picked up the family business at an early age. In his teenage years, Clark started to take pictures of his friends doing drugs, marking the start of what would become his signature photographs of teenagers engaged in drug use and sexual activities. Born in 1943 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Clark attended the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee, WI. In 1964, the artist moved to New York, NY, and started to take freelance photography jobs. However, he was soon drafted into the military during the Vietnam War. Clark served from 1964 to 1966, and then returned to Tulsa. In 1971, he published his first book of photography, Tulsa, which documented his friends' use of drugs in black and white. In 1973, he received a Photographers' Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. He also received the Photographers' Grant from the Creative Arts Public Service in 1980. In 1993, Clark directed Chris Isaak's Solitary Manmusic video. In 1995, he released his first film, Kids, which was controversial, as it depicted children as young as 12 drinking alcohol and doing drugs. Kids, and a photo series called Skaters, both featured the skateboarding subculture of the early 1990s. In 2002, he released Ken Park, which featured actors portraying underage characters engaging in sexual activities. The film was banned in Australia, and was not widely released in the United States. In 2005, Clark was awarded the International Photography Lucie Award for Achievement in Documentary Photography. He has won prizes at the Cognac Festival du Film Policier for Another Day in Paradise and at the Stockholm Film Festival for Bully. His photographs are part of many public collections, including those at the Whitney Museum of Art, in New York, and the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, MA. Clark has had solo exhibitions at the Galerie Urbi et Orbi in Paris, France, in 1992; at the Taka Ishii Gallery in Tokyo, Japan, in 1996; and at the International Center of Photography in New York, in 2005. ""I don’t try to be controversial, I just try to be honest and tell the truth about life. Coming from the art world, I never think there are things you can’t do or show. I think that Hollywood films are really underestimating their audience. I’ve been an artist for many, many years. I’m not interested in making films to make money. I’m interested in making work that I’m satisfied with, showing people’s lives that aren’t shown.  If I could see this anywhere else, I wouldn’t have to make these films."" Larry Clark currently lives and works in Los Angeles and New York.",1020
Massimo Vitali,"An Italian photographer, Massimo Vitali is best known for his monumental color photographs of beaches, pools, and social gatherings, often taken from removed vantage points. Through his practice, he adapts the historical practice of landscape painting and figural studies to the photographic lens. Richly colored, detailed and large-scale, Vitali's work balances between interpersonal narratives and the natural world, capturing human activity amidst panoramic views of landscapes. Focusing on the voyeuristic capacities of photography, he examines the anonymous, detached nature of urban life in the interactions between his subjects. Ever since 1994, Vitali has been traveling the world documenting how and where people gather - from picnickers in the Luxembourg Gardens and spectators at an air show in Viareggio to tourists massed on the Piazza San Marco. As he explained, his photography comes from absolute matter-of-fact situations but also from a deep curiosity that he possess for people, for what they do and how they think. Vitali's best-known work is his series Italian beach panoramas, which reflect a research into his fellow Italian citizens, as well as his interest in capturing and analyzing how people think and act. He currently lives and works in Berlin and in Lucca, Italy. ",1021
Rene Gruau,"One of the crucial persons for the re-establishment of luxury after the World War II, René Gruau was a creator of timeless expression of style, elegance, and sophistication, illustrations that were a favorite of the haute couture world through the second half of the 20th century. Probably best known for his advertisements for Miss Dior perfume and for Rouge Baiser lipstick, the artist worked with all prominent magazines and most recognized designers of that time, giving them radiance and sublimity that the fashion industry previously lacked. There were only a few artists who have had a career long and prolific as René Gruau who, from his beginnings during the 1920’s until death in 2004, never stopped to create, leaving an oeuvre of posters encompassing the most prominent fashion advertisements. Inspired by the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and the aesthetic of Art Nouveau, his illustrations reflected the expressive line and controlled color of his predecessors. His coverage of the latest trends in clothing, accessories and perfumery induced an awareness of French fashion after the World War II, when the industry need a support to recover.   Born Count Renato Zavagli Ricciardelli delle Caminate in Rimini, Italy in 1909, he was a son of the Italian father and French mother, both aristocrats who separated when he was three when he moved to Paris with her mother, later adopting her last name, erasing Italian royal connections. He was very early determined to reject the job of royal military commander and instead follow his passion for arts, profiling himself as the refined illustrator of fashion. Thanks to his mother, passionate traveler and fashionista who introduced him to painters and magazine editors who encouraged him to pursue his craft, at the age of 14, Gruau started to sell his drawings to the Milanese fashion journal Lidel and then to work for magazines such as Femina, Marie Claire, and Vogue. After some difficulties and lack of work due to the war, Gruau finally got a job at new small designer studio of Christian Dior. In 1947 he officially became his artistic director for advertising, helping the creation of the “New Look” and accomplishing friendship and very successful collaboration that Gruau is mostly remembered for. His most famous project for him, the Miss Dior, the house’s first branded perfume launched in 1949, remained recognizable until today for his swan with the pearl necklace. Aimed at a new generation, swan as the reminiscent of the décor of 18th century France was a symbol of renewal. Also hired by major designers of that time, such as Pierre Balmain, Jacques Fath, Balenciaga, Elsa Schiaparelli, Rochas, Lanvin, Elizabeth Arden, and Hubert de Givenchy, Gruau was credited for expanding their popularity with his eye-catchy illustrations. His images are recognizable for his characteristic signature that evolved from his full name to cipher of capital G and a starlike shape said to have originated in a blob of ink.   His flair and unique approach, with his trademark use of his powerful minimal line, Gruau’s style combined seductive sophistication with classic beauty, grace, and sensual elegance. His posters often echoed both classical Japanese drawings and Toulouse-Lautrec’s sketches of Paris nightlife. During the 1940’s and 1950’s, Gruau became a favorite of the high fashion world, working with Femina, L’Officiel, L’Album Du Figaro, and other high-style magazines. In 1948, he moved to the United States to create illustrations for Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue, later becoming the exclusive artist for Flair, but rejecting Hollywood invitation to design costumes and posters. It soon became obvious that Gruau is a man of many talents and skills – an illustrator and poster maker, painter and designer of costumes and stage sets, and even created his own collection of clothing in 1948-49. Still, all of his various works are recognizable for his style, strongly determined at the time when photography threatened the poster art. Gruau’s art is marked with his fluid, expressive and seemingly simple and easy lines and ability to decompose his subjects to their essence, accomplishing the maximum effect – a face, mouth, hairstyle, gesture and the structure of the clothes, everything was described in detail, but deprived of needless and reduced to graceful economy of means. Still, simple lines and broad brush strokes were not only the characteristic of his style but also the way for easier reproduction of his posters. Throughout his career, Gruau always insisted on the clear point of working with models that he chose very carefully. Refusing to create pure paper images, he demanded the strong personality, basing a lot on their movements, expressions, and attitudes, choosing some of the most elegant women to pose, such as Nitzah Bricard, Dior’s muse or the famous model Bettina Graziani. Another important quality of his work was his proficiency to use the right perspective, experimenting with high and low angles and negative spaces, Gruau managed to make images that naturally attract the human eye. His distinctive style was determined by use of mostly three colors: black, white, and red. This characteristic that became his trademark is actually the consequence of his previous work of an illustrator, considering the fact that most of his drawings for newspapers and magazines implied drawing in black on the white surface of the paper with the use of one color, in his case red. As the color he personally liked the most, red is also the most perceivable and such as, the most appropriate for advertisement. One of his most influential works is his cinema poster for Fellini’s La Dolce Vita (1959) – much 1960’s cinema artwork derives from it, but no less important are the campaigns for names such as Dior, Air France, Martini and Omega watches.   His absolute mastery of graphic art is reflected in his unique way of expression conjoined with an innate appreciation of the magical elements that make fashion and glamour so wanted. With their lasting ability to seduce and inspire, his images manage to survive so many decades remaining fresh and contemporary. His campaigns for Moulin Rouge and Lido de Paris evoked the old aesthetic of traditional poster art of Toulouse-Lautrec, Bonnard, and other 19th century Parisian painters. Doubtless one of the most important fashion illustrators that have ever lived, René Gruau’s works are today collected and exhibited all over the world, including Louvre in Paris. From the early beginnings of the fashion industry, until his death in 2004, at the age of 95, Gruau worked with the same enthusiasm and devotion, creating historical examples of advertising.  ",1022
Stephan Balkenhol,"A German contemporary sculptor, Stephan Balkenhol is best known for his representational works carved out of wood. His focus on the human form was a divergent response to the abstract, minimalist and conceptual approaches of the Hamburg School of Fine Arts of the 1970s. Born in 1957 in Fritzlar (Hesse) in Germany, he currently lives and works between Kassel, Karlsruhe, Berlin, and Meisenthal, France. He studied at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg from 1976-82. He has been a Professor at Akademie für Bildende Künste, Karlsruhe, Germany, since 1992. He exhibited worldwide, including venues such as Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg, Germany, Stephen Friedman Gallery, London, England, Museum Jorn, Silkeborg, Denmark, Museum of Sepulchral Culture, Kassel, Germany, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris, France, and Deweer Gallery, Brussels. His first figurative wooden sculptures from 1983 of a larger-than-life naked man and woman placed the human figure reintroduced the figure to contemporary sculpture. Since the 1990s, he also began introducing animals and hybrids, and more recently architecture to his artistic vocabulary. Using a hammer and chisel to gouge his figures out of the tree trunk, the artist leaves the shavings and traces of the tools visible in the wood with its knots, grain and cracks.",1023
Rufino Tamayo,"Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo (Rufino Arellanes Tamayo) created figurative abstract paintings that combined European and Mexican styles. Among the influences, he cited Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Georges Braque. The artist rejected the political connotation that ruled the Mexican art scene at the time, favoring the easel paintings. In them, he perfectly mixed Surrealism and Cubism with the subjects from Mexican culture. Besides being a painter, Tamayo was also a prolific printmaker and a sculptor that enjoyed experimenting with bronze and iron.     Rufino Tamayo was born in 1899 in Oaxaca, Mexico, and after the tragic death of his parents, he moved with his aunt to Mexico City. There he discovered a deep passion for art once he enrolled into art classes. Tamayo studied for a short time at the at Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas in San Carlos in 1917. However, soon the artist left the school because he felt he could learn much more on his own. Tamayo began working at the Department of Ethnographic Drawings with Jose Vasconcelos, of which he later became the director. Tamayo became a member of Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (LEAR) in 1935. It was a place where he could express his feelings through his artworks about the issues concerning the political situation in Mexico and the Mexican Revolutionary War. Tamayo was chosen to showcase his works in the first American Artists’ Congress in New York. What was supposed to be a short visit turned into the artist's permanent home for more than ten years, from 1936 to 1950.   Tamayo’s artworks are influenced by his Zapotec heritage. During the Mexican revolt in 1974, he created one of the most renowned paintings titled Children Playing With Fire. It depicts two figures on fire, alluding to the government’s bad decisions that hurt the people and led to the revolt. The artist experimented with woodcuts, etchings, lithographs, and Mixografia prints, producing a number of artworks between 1925 and 1991. The Mixografia prints combined the prints with three-dimensional textures and were invented by the Tamayo in collaboration with a fellow Mexican painter. Throughout his life, he painted a number of images of women, mostly portraying his wife Olga. The most famous one is the Rufino and Olga painting from 1934. Tamayo depicted his subjects in a symbolic or semiabstract way and often used vibrant colors and textured surfaces.   In 1950 Tamayo achieved world recognition after exhibiting his works at the Venice Biennale. A number of his murals were commissioned by important institutions such as UNESCO in Paris, for which he created the mural Prometheus Bringing Fire to Man in 1958. A number of his works can be seen today at the Tamayo Contemporary Art Museum in Mexico City that was opened in 1981. Others are part of permanent exhibits in several museums around the globe, including The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, Spain, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, and the Phillips Collection in Washington. Rufino Tamayo died in Mexico City in 1991.

William Copley,"William Copley was an American painter and patron of the arts of some renown whose late Surrealist works have been seen as an early part of the American Pop Art movement of the 1950s and 1960s. William Nelson Copley, also known as CPLY, was born in New York City in 1919. He was found on the doorstep of the New York Foundling Hospital at the tail end of the Influenza epidemic, which likely killed his parents. In or around 1921 he was adopted by Ira C. and Edith Copley and taken home to Aurora, Illinois. The elder Copley, a utilities magnate, had had several runs for Congress and began purchasing newspapers in Illinois and later in Southern California. A few years after the adoption took place, Edith Copley died and Ira Copley remarried. When Bill was ten years old Copley moved his family to Coronado Island, California just across the bay from San Diego. Bill was a sickly child and missed a lot of school. He read a lot to keep up and was later sent to Phillips Andover and Yale. As a painter, writer, gallerist, supporter, and publisher, William N. Copley blazed a singular path through numerous territories of post-war art, along the way charting a vital link between the European Surrealist and the American Pop Art movements. Copley didn't enter the art world as a painter, instead, he became a patron to the arts in 1947. At this time, he opened an art gallery in Beverly Hills to display Surrealist Art, after discovering the Surrealist movement on a trip to Mexico. In his gallery, Copley displayed the works of artists including Rene Magritte, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, Joseph Cornell, and Man Ray. During the single year of the gallery's operation, Copley painted part-time, turning to full-time painting once the galley closed from lack of sales. After the close of the gallery, the artist moved to Paris. During the 1950s and 1960s, while living and working in Paris, Copley painted a collection of Surrealist work featuring classic American images presented with humorous and ironic undertones. Copley's paintings in this period dealt with ironic and humorous images of stereotypical American symbols like the Western saloon, cowboys, and pin-up girls combined with flags. The first exhibition of his work was in 1951, in Los Angeles at Royer's Book Shop. This exhibition was followed by further showings in New York, Venice, Paris, and London. Copley’s paintings were a combination of the Mexican and American Folk Art with the Modern Surrealist look, creating the early Pop Art look for which he has become noted. In the 1970s, his work continued to evolve, featuring more erotic content. In 1974, Copley exhibited this new line of work, calling the exhibition CPLY X-Rated. Though his new work received little recognition in the United States, it encountered a wider appeal when exhibited in Europe. His work is collected both in private and public collections worldwide. The work of CPLY has been the subject of numerous single artist shows and a traveling retrospective at the Kunsthalle Bern, Centre Georges Pompidou, and the Stedelijk Van Abbesmuseum, and has been exhibited in several important group exhibitions, including documenta 5 and documenta 7. The artist died on May 7, 1996.",1025
Ross Bleckner,"Ross Bleckner is an influential American artist who is primarily known for his poetic paintings that deal with complex themes such as losing something one loves and different aspects of memory. Bleckner usually relies on recurring, highly symbolic imagery, such as doves and flowers, as well as glowing, blurred light effects[1]. Ever since he achieved stardom in the 1980s, Ross was clearly inspired by the emotional tolls situations like the AIDS crisis brought on. He once explained his art with the following statement: Life is short. Life goes fast. And what I really want to do in my life is to bring something new, something beautiful and something filled with light into the world.  Ross Bleckner was born in New York City and the Big Apple served the role of home for the majority of this artist's career. In 1974, Ross moved into a Tribeca loft building where three of the floors were rented by the painter Julian Schnabel. These floors were later turned int the Mudd Club, a nightclub very popular with musicians and artists of all types and mediums. Ross held his first solo exhibition in the year of 1975, a show held at the Cunningham Ward Gallery in New York. Four years later, Bleckner started his association with the Mary Boone Gallery. Starting with the 1980s, Ross created artwork as an openly gay author. Most of his early topics were quite challenging and complex - Bleckner investigated themes of personal transformation, painful losses, how we handle our memories[2]. He often referenced the AIDS problem as the illness was taking lives at an alarming rate back then. The artist usually relied on symbolic imagery to get the message across to the viewers, utilizing this type of communicating through carefully established motifs much rather than standard representation.  In 1995, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum had a major retrospective of his paintings made during the last two decades. Through his philanthropic efforts, especially those that came to be during the course of Ross' mature career, Bleckner has enabled many organizations to perform their work and achieve goals. Ross is a part of many such organizations, like the AIDS Community Research Initiative of America[3], a non-profit community also known as ACRIA. Works made by Bleckner are held in collections around the world, some of which are located in the most prestigious institutions of the art world. His pieces are a part of acquisitions of Museum of Modern Art in New York, Museum of Contemporary Art, in Los Angeles and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. In 2009, Bleckner was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations - he was the first fine artist to receive the position. It should also be noted that Ross is currently a Clinical Professor of Studio Art at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.    With their large-scale and strong emotional impact, Ross Bleckner's pieces are extremely capable of evoking a compelling, borderline opiate and dizzying effect. Regardless of whether he is depicting abstract stripes or symbolic representational images of something like birds, Bleckner always manages to cause strong emotional reactions within his viewers. Such an ability is pretty much a guaranty of popularity and it comes as no surprise that, wherever Ross' work goes, the artistic hype follows. Bleckner's takes on the concepts of human body, health, disease and death are oftentimes terrifying but always astonishing experiences that leave no one unfazed. This artist is represented by Puccio Fine Art and Kunzt.gallery.  References:   ",1026
Alfonso Ossorio,"Alfonso A. Ossorio was a Filipino-American painter whose art synthesized Abstract Expressionism, Surrealism and Art Brut in different periods. These styles and the artist representing them, such as Jackson Pollock and Jean Dubuffet, influenced him greatly, shaping a course of his career. Born in Manila, the Philippines in 1916, Ossorio attended school in England between the ages of eight and thirteen. At age fourteen, he moved to the United States, where he graduated from Harvard University and Rhode Island School of Design. He became an American citizen in 1933 and served as a medical illustrator in the United States Army during World War II. His early works were dominated by still lifes, landscapes, and portraits executed in a visual style that the artist has characterized as “a kind of super-realism”. Influenced by Pollock and Dubuffet, his style began to morph into more abstract and overtly expressionistic work. He also became artistically fascinated with “problems which religion covers, such as birth, sex, death”. Over the years, he developed a direct and gestural manner of experimental painting filled with dense thickets of lines and splatters. A vital force within the abstract expressionist movement, he contributed significantly in both artistic and curatorial capacities. ",1027
Bernar Venet,"Bernar Venet is a French conceptual artist, a pioneer of conceptual art in New York in the late 1960s. He is best known for his versatility in multiple mediums, including painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, as well as stage design and musical composition.  Venet was born in a small village in the French Alps. He was brought up in Chateau-Arnoux-Saint-Auban in the region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur where he had a religious upbringing, aspiring to become a missionary. As a child, he was often sick with asthma, leaving him unable to lead an active childhood. In school, he had a problem with vigorous expectations on academic subjects while, at the same time, he excelled in drawing and painting. With the help of a local artist, Venet began to explore art as he became interested in painting and drawing more and more each day. The book about Renoir was a turning point in his childhood - he was only 11 when he understood that he might be able to turn his talent and hobby into a real profession, even career. Same year Bernar is invited to exhibit in the Salon de Peinture Pechiney on Paris. From 1955 to 1958, he studied at Ecole Libre and Groupe Scolaire Paul Lapie; and then, in 1959, Venet studied for a year at the Municipal Art School of Nice. Right after, he began working as a stage designer at Opera de Nice where he produced a highly stylized paintings described by himself as symbolic.  In 1961, Venet joined the French Army where he converted an attic of the local army reception center to a studio. During this period, he painted with tar, creating art with coal. Venet called this style fetishist works, as he was creating on the floor, with his feet in a gestural style. Later, this has developed into a black monochromatic painting, adopting in time all forms of action painting.  In some cases, he worked on a surface without leaving trace of his action, so the blank surface would become a work.   In 1963, Venet has returned to Nice and opened a studio to continue his tar art, now also photographing coal and gravel piles. At this time, he created his first sculpture or better said sculptures, Coal Pile - piles of loosely arranged pieces of coal whose arrangement varied with each installation. Venet became well known for his amorphous installations made by piling up loose gravel, coal, or asphalt. In 1964, Venet found a great deal of inspiration in works by Nouveaux Réalisme style artists. Venet began to make pieces out of used and discarded industrial material, such as flattened cardboard creating so called industrial paintings.  On his first trip to New York, Venet was amazed and influenced by the Minimalist artwork he saw in galleries and while encountering  Minimalist artists such as Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, and Sol LeWitt. He was stunned by the formal restraint of those works. When he returned to Nice, Venet began to work on mono-semiotic works and diagrams, while at the same time he was composing, choreographing and creating costumes and designs for Jean-Louis Martinoty’s production of the ballet Graduation, a ballet performed on a vertical surface. Soon after, in 1967, Venet definitely moved to New York. When he was (in 1966) invited to participate in an exhibition at the Céret Museum in the Pyrenees, Venet simply sent a blueprint of a tube instead of the tube itself. “Nobody made a plan like this and presented it as a work of art, so I thought what if I present it as a work of art? Why make an object? Everybody makes objects. How about showing the information about an object, but not the object?”  In the beginning of his life in NY, Venet has produced conceptual art that used systems, often based on scientific ideas – he collaborated with scientists from Columbia University and produced the non visual works on magnetic tape, as his focus was on content, not the visual characteristics of artworks. In 1971, Venet decided to cease his artistic work to travel throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan. He even taught art and art theory in Sorbonne, France, lecturing throughout Europe as well. At the time, retrospectives of his work were held at the Krefeld Museum, Germany, and New York Cultural Center, New York.  While pausing, Venet resumed his work based on mathematical systems, in paintings, wood reliefs, and sculpture as he wrote about conceptual art and his own work to the time. Upon the return to New York, he soon began his first piece of the series titled Angles and Arcs, a group of extremely restrained paintings of elementary geometrical figures.  In 1983 Seth Schneidman produced the film Bernar Venet 1983 in New York. Next year he held a first exhibition of Indeterminate Lines sculptures, a series based on randomly created lines, at Galerie Templon, Paris.  Venet said about his sculptures: “They are all about how metal resists. They are a test of strength—a battle between myself and the piece of metal.” In the 1990s, Venet composed various musical compositions, such as Resonance and Sound. During this time, he had his first furniture exhibition at Galerie Mostra, Paris, and then Galerie Eric Van de Weghe in Brussels. In 2001, Assouline published Furniture, a book on all of his designs.  In 2000, he began a series of monumental wall paintings. At the time, Venet also created sound recordings, films (on film festival in Montreal Venet presented his film Acier Roulé XC-10), as well as furniture and stained glass. In 2005, the artist was named Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur, France’s highest decoration and next year, in 2006, Venet received the Robert Jacobsen prize for sculpture from the Würth Stiftung in Germany. In 2007, his piece Saturation on the ceiling of the Cour des Comptes in Paris was inaugurated by President Jacques Chirac. In 2008, Sotheby's invited for the first time a single artist, Venet, to present his work on the grounds of the Isleworth Country Club. Continuing to evolve each day, Venet still works in many different mediums – sculpture, painting, photography, film, music composition, performance art and furniture design.

Johnny Friedlaender,"Johnny Friedlaender was a German artist born in 1912, well known for his pioneering use of aquatint etching, a technically difficult artistic process. Born in Pless in the former German kingdom of Prussia, Friedlaender attended the Academy of Arts in Breslau, where he studied lithography and etching under Expressionist artist Otto Mueller.",1029

Jiri Kolar,"Jiří Kolář was an influential Czech cultural figure – a poet, writer, painter, and translator. Throughout his longstanding practice, he constantly and devotedly aimed to deconstruct everyday reality by underlining the repressive nature of politics. Kolář took a critical stance towards the regime in former Czechoslovakia and was banned from publishing his works, after ending up in prison during the 1950s. Kolář belongs to the group of influential intellectuals (which also included Václav Havel) who were inspired by the Prague Spring, when the communist regime became more permissive. Due to his critical engagement, Kolář was banned from returning home after a scholarship to West Berlin, and so from 1980 on he lived in Paris. Since the 1960s, Kolar was more engaged with visual art and started experimenting, by perfecting the collage form.",1031

Leon Polk Smith,"Leon Polk Smith was an American artist born in 1906. His geometrically oriented abstract paintings were influenced by Piet Mondrian and his style has been associated with the Hard-edge school, of which he is considered one of the founders. Born near Chickasha, Oklahoma, Smith attended Oklahoma State College in Ada, Oklahoma and later the Columbia University Teacher's School. During his first semester at Columbia, one of his teachers took him to see the Gallatin Collection, then at New York University, an experience that sparked his artistic development. The paintings of Mondrian and sculpture by Constantin Brâncuși and Jean Arp served as a formative experience for him. Smith first rose to prominence in the late 1950s with a body of work titled the Correspondences, characterized by distinctively shaped canvases that typically consist of two vibrantly-colored painted shapes defined by a precise but often irregular contour. The key motifs in his works were inspired by baseballs and tennis balls, attempting to create a new kind of space from these simple shapes. Introducing this single curving line, Smith created two pictorial spaces, allowing for the interchangeability of positive and negative space. He continued to explore the potential of the curvilinear shape throughout his career, advancing the formal and rational elements of the Modernist tradition.",1033
Stanley William Hayter,"Stanley William Hayter was an English painter and printmaker associated in the 1930s with Surrealism and from 1940 onward with Abstract Expressionism. Regarded as one of the most significant printmakers of the 20th century, in 1927 Hayter founded the legendary Atelier 17 studio in Paris. He is noted for his innovative work in the development of viscosity printing (a process that exploits varying viscosities of oil-based inks to lay three or more colors on a single intaglio plate). He died in Paris in 1988.",1034
Peter Beard,"Peter Hill Beard was an American photographer and writer, who lived in New York and Kenya. In his captures of African wildlife, he explored the subjects of death and destruction. For decades, he made powerful images of animals that were often followed by his own journal writing. Since 1970 he kept a diary where he wrote his daily contemplations and used every media available such as collage, paper clippings, herbarium leaves and flowers, photos of friends and lovers, and many tiny found objects. These scrapbooks remained a distinctive form of expression for Beard, and he gained international fame with his unusual personal journaling. The most extreme method he used was writing and painting in animal blood, and the blood of his own.  For six decades Peter Beard photographed Africa's wildlife and landscapes, keeping a diary of his work and experiences. He often openly spoke about mistreat and animal abuse in Africa, about elephant massacres that were happening in the 60's and 70's. His love for nature inspired him to became an artist, grounded in firm belief that nature is the best thing we got, a cradle of life, nurturing and giving, the one that made all the life on this planet possible. He settled for ornamental style, often working with dark themes, trying to emphasize the importance of preservation and fighting for animal rights. His commitment to the protection of endangered species continuously motivated him to push boundaries and to work harder. Beard's personal style is nostalgic and humorous, with a touch of dark, opaque, often disturbing elements. The artist was born in 1938 in New York and he spent most of his childhood in Alabama and Long Island. As a child he started taking photographs, keeping a diary, while spending most of his time outdoors. He went to Pomfret School and enrolled at the Yale University where he wanted to study medicine. In strange circumstances, he decided that pre-med was not suitable for him and switched his major completely to art history. The first trips to Africa happened in 1955, and after the graduation, he knew that he needed to go back there. His first adventure to Kenya happened in 1960 where he started working at the National Park in Tsavo. He documented the massacre of nearly 35,000 elephants and other wild animals and used the images in his first published book The End of the Game in 1965. He earned and saved enough money to buy his first ranch, the Hog Ranch, which remained his second home.   After he witnessed the demise of wildlife in Africa, he decided to fight for saving the planet from violence and animals from extinction. He published multiple books on elephants and black rhinos. Deeply disturbed by the gory scenes he witnessed he started keeping a journal, in the same manner as he did when he was a child and memorized all the experiences from his African adventures, both good and bad. The journal consisted of photographic collages and his own writing, where he poured his feelings. Peter Beard mostly wondered about the nature of the relationship between men and animals and about the circle of life. He switched homes quite often and in his time in New York he befriended some of the most notable artists of the 60's and 70's, like Warhol, Richard Linder (who was his mentor at Yale University), writer Truman Capote and many other prominent artists and writers from the New York creative circle. He collaborated with few of them and joined them in New York nightlife adventures. His portfolio was enriched during the late 70's and the 80's with portraits of supermodels, rock stars, celebrities, scientists, and politicians. He was loved and appreciated in jet-set life in New York City and adored by the press and paparazzi. As an artist he did not like to label himself, he wanted to stay free of categorization so he could explore his interest without being suspended by any definitions. He was a socialite, but an anthropologist also. After his first exhibition in 1975 at the Blum Helman gallery in New York, many international exhibitions followed. He exhibited his journals, collages, photographs, African jewelry, and artifacts. Beard never hesitated to use extreme methods to depict extreme experiences. His character was wild and his spirit remained untamed.   Although he was popular in social circles, part of the Studio 54 gang and enjoying the reputation of New York's playboy, he wasn't much appreciated in the serious circles of the American artists. His rebellious spirit couldn't let him follow any sort of rules and regulations, and sometimes he intentionally tried not to be taken seriously. If there is a fine line between a coward and silly courageousness, Beard crossed it decades ago, when he fiercely entered his African adventures, never worrying about his safety. He swam with crocodiles, ran from stampedes of wild animals, and in 1996 unfortunately injured himself in one of his missions. An angry elephant stepped on him, crushing his pelvis and hips, injuring his leg. Extreme lust for life and love for nature and medical help helped him to recover and to be able to walk and work again. For decades, his obsession and passion were animals and the disruption of life in Africa as we know it. At the beginning of 21st century he started to explore a different kind of destruction, the loss of moral compass among men, both in Africa and Northern America. He was threatened, robbed, pointed a gun at, robbed again, almost dealt with bankruptcy, but still stayed thirsty for excitement. Once he said to himself that he was probably the most irresponsible person in the world. His incautious character got him in many unfortunate situations but led him to great length when it comes to photographing and journaling.   The first diary, that he later used for African stories, was given to him by lovely Jackie Onassis. The leather bound book contained all of his thoughts, a lot of found objects, photographs of famous people, receipts, food wrapping, pieces of fabric, drawings and quotations, small insects, fish bones, even cigarettes. When it comes to photography he didn't like to categorize himself as a photographer, believing that the medium lost its ability to be personal and genuine, that many gave up the genuineness in order to succeed and monetize their art. In 2015 his book The End of the Game was republished and critics found that it has maybe even more relevance in 2015 than it had 50 years ago. The white men explorations in Africa and the local crime destroyed the original beauty. Hunting for trophies destroyed the flora and fauna. The book is filled with devastating images and text, that on the 292 pages chronicle the violence against endangered animals, especially elephants. The photos present an emotional statement of the human intervention in Africa's wildlife. The are personal and universal at the same time. Peter Beard felt the injustice deeply and the extinction of animals determined his career, however, photos depict the global cries of animal killings, especially rhinos, hippos and elephants. In 2009 he collaborated with Pirelli and made calendar dedicated to environmental and climate changes. The calendar got major approval, it was even supported by the general secretary of the UN convention. Beard wanted to make a reminder, a warning note even, to be careful how we treat the animals and to what extent we go to protect our planet. There are several more publications of his diaries, but his personal favorite is the Zara's Tales: Perilous Escapades in Equatorial Africa, a book dedicated to his daughter Zara in which he writes about the tales of Hog Ranch, about handsome animals and their adventures, about adventures and explorations, and above anything, about the importance of living in harmony with all the living things. Toward the end of his life, Peter Beard suffered from dementia. On March 31, his family reported him missing from the premises of his property on Long Island’s East End. His body was found 19 days later in the woods of Montauk. All images via Afritorial.com",1035

Robert Mangold,"Paint less to say more – that’s always been a motto of Minimalism. The work of Robert Mangold isn’t that much different. He paints minimalistic artworks and he could be described as an abstract artist. The simple elements are put together through complex means as he explores and creates his own artistic vocabulary which is derived from the ideas of geometry and asymmetry, expressed through both shapes and forms. Through his clear and direct artworks, he has established a variety of relationships, such as shape in relation to space, drawing in relation to the edge of the canvas, and he constantly questions the relationship between the parts and the whole.  Mangold feels that the painting is quite a difficult art to grasp, especially if it’s an abstract piece since it simply doesn’t possess an anchor for the people to grab hold of. In relation to installations or sculptures, who exist in the space and around which people can walk and observe from all the angles, painting is something that’s hanging on the wall, with a clear space between itself and the viewer. The shape has always been very important for Mangold, and they have changed over the years, going from squares with the corners cut out, double triangles, to half circles.    All paintings elicit space, not within the piece, but rather the space occupied by the painting, and that’s also an important part of Mangold’s work. He likes working in large formats because of the sense of relative scale from the viewers to him. There are limitations, of course, and the artist prefers to make artworks that are relative to a human size. He does make smaller pieces, but only as studies for the bigger ones. For him, the culmination of the idea is expressed through larger work. What is also interesting about his work is the constant exploration of the relationship between the fragments and the whole, and his ability to give each individual fragment a function as a whole. As the artist states, a half-circle is a complete shape despite the implication that it’s not a complete shape. This struggle between the complete and incomplete has been explored in different series, and through different means.    Mangold was born in North Tonawanda, New York. He studied at the Cleveland Institute of Art in Ohio, and at the Yale University School of Art and Architecture in New Haven Connecticut, where he earned his BFA in 1961 and his MFA in 1963. Robert is married to Sylvia Plimack Mangold, who is also an artist. Since his first solo show in 1961, he has exhibited at some of the most prestigious institutions around the world, including the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Kunsthalle Basel, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.   All artists should rely on their intuition. It is going to make their work more personal and give it a quality that no other artist possesses. Mangold, even when planning what is he going to paint, relies on his instincts. The choice of a color simply hasn’t got a rational justification behind it, except maybe to induce reflection in viewers. He considers his paint not to be a paint in a traditional painter’s sense – it is just a color. Even if he works on the surface that’s very uneven, the artist prefers to apply the color with the roller rather than a brush. He is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art in Miami.  ",1037
Nancy Spero,"Does the artist have ethical and political responsibilities in this world of cruelty and so much suffering? During entire career, Nancy Spero was devoted to the search for an answer to this question, struggling with the brutality of human race. As a pioneer of feminist art, her work was directed against the abuse of power, Western privilege, and male dominance, processing the subject matter from both current and past events, as the oppression of Jews and the Holocaust, the torture of women in Nicaragua or horrors of the Vietnam war. Spero’s enormous courage and great imagination moved across painting, collage, printmaking and installations, creating a distinctive piece of art that she once called a “peinture feminine”.  Spero was born in 1926, in Cleveland, Ohio, but she grew up in Chicago, where she graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Continuing her education in Paris, she studied painting at Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts and at Atelier of Andre Lhote, early Cubist painter, and critic. In 1950, Spero returned to the United States and married Leon Golub, a fellow artist from Chicago school of art. Finding European society and atmosphere more varied and inclusive to artists, the couple lived in Italy, and later in Paris, creating and bringing up their three children. Inspired by Etruscan and Roman frescoes and sarcophagi, her style was the closest to Abstract Expressionism. During her Paris years (1959-1964) she worked on series of Black Paintings, depicting androgynous figures and scrawled text fragments incorporated into the themes of mothers and children, lovers and prostitutes.    In 1964, they returned to the United States, in New York where she remained for the rest of her life. Deeply affected by the violence and atrocities of the Vietnam war, Spero began her War Series (1966-1970). Abandoning the oil on canvas, she chose gouache and ink on paper that allowed her to create more rapidly, making the “angry works, often scatological, manifestos against a senseless obscene war; a war my sons could have been called up for, though they were very young. These works were exorcisms to keep the war away.” One hundred and fifty pieces depict horrors of war – bombs, serpents, fire, swastikas, atomic mushroom clouds, and among them, the most characteristic is anthropomorphic helicopters as the birds that destroy from above.   As one of the first feminist, Spero was active in several movements, as Art Workers Coalition, Women Artist in Revolution and even was a founding member of the first women-only cooperative gallery, A.I.R. (Artists in Residence). From 1971 to 1972, she was committed to her series of scroll works named Codex Artaud, distinctive collages that use juxtapositions of text and image with the horizontal and linear partition of elements that recall hieroglyphics, showing the parts of text taken from Antonin Artaud’s writings. The sum of her activism and female artists’ empowerment, found its expression in Spero’s encyclopedic work Notes in Time on Women (1979). On the 210-foot-lons scroll, she was charting the female status throughout history, representing figures of different women who move among quotations about misogyny in the canon of male European philosophers.     From the 1980’s onward, she continued to make a powerful influence on the younger generations of artists, constantly working with the strong sense of hope, despite problems with health during the last years of her life. Nancy Spero died of heart failure in New York on October 18, 2009. Never utopian, her work varied in mood from lacerating and shocking to playful and comical. Her figures co-exist in nonhierarchical compositions on monumental scrolls, visually reinforcing principles of equality and tolerance. Throughout her entire career, Spero performed from the radical pacifist and feminist position, highly dedicated to her political, social and cultural convictions, constantly asking the questions and challenging injustice and violence.

Darkcloud,"Darkcloud (sometimes Darkclouds or Dark Cloud) is a pseudonym for an unknown painter, who is primarily known for his graffiti and street art. The artist began his academic training in 1998 at School of the Museum for Fine Arts (SMFA) in Boston, and graduated from it in 2000.   Darkcloud's unique images are easily recognizable, as each one has a characteristic cloud-like shape – the artist's trademark sign. Throughout his career, he has worked with many renowned street artists.  Darkcloud has also participated in numerous group shows, projects and one-man exhibitions. Some of his more notable participations included Paint it Now, a 2008 project organized by Thomas Buildmore and Scott Chasse, where many different artists painted the gallery walls. In 2010, Darkcloud was also a part of Stokenphobia, a group exhibition set up by Pandemic Gallery in Brooklyn, New York. His most notable duo exhibition Street language was done in collaboration with Matt Siren. The show was held at Woodward Gallery, New York, in 2008.

Kenji Nakayama,"Kenji Nakayama is a Japanese artist, best known for his designs and sign paintings which he makes using stencils. Nakayama was born in 1979, in Tomakomai, a city on Hokkaido island. Unlike many artists today, Kenji didn't set out to be an artist. In 1998, he enrolled in Musashi Institute of Technology in Tokyo, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. However, two years later, he moved to Boston where he wanted to learn the arts of traditional sign painting and subsequently, pursue a career in art. In 2004, Nakayama was accepted to Butera School of Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 2006.  Kenji believes that inspiration comes from within. His artworks are heavily influenced by his past and present habits and lifestyle. When it comes to his practice, to say that it's disparate would be an understatement. He creates prints and rich signs, sometimes free-handedly, sometimes using stencils. Every single stencil painting can take him several months to finish, and it is usually very complex and perfectly complements the environment around it. Nakayama often draws from simple things in his everyday life, such as humor, music, urban life, or solitude.   Nakayama has displayed his artworks extensively throughout the US and the world. Some of the more notable group shows include Take a Deep Breath, organized by Carmichael Gallery in West Hollywood in 2008 (this was his first group exhibition), The May Lane Street Art Project at the Anne and Gordon Samstag Museum of Art in Australia in 2012, Sur-Real exhibition at Woodward Gallery in 2014. Kenji's highly acclaimed one-man exhibitions include the 2010's Brooklyn and 2011's Clouded Vision, both organized by Woodward Gallery in New York. Apart from these, Kenji had several collaborative shows with Dana Woulfe at Loft F Gallery and Hellion Gallery.   Kenji Nakayama continues his practice by featuring in the group show Constructed Communication at the Museum of Craft and Design (MCD) in San Francisco, next to Amy Sinbondit and Ben Venom. Kenji packs entire narratives into singular words and phrases by way of his indexical knowledge and practice of hand lettering. Constructed Communication is a combination of talk and technique where Kenji communicates as much through the serifs and calligraphic flourishes of his letters as through the words his letters spell.

Jeffrey Gibson,"Part Choctaw and part Cherokee, Jeffrey Gibson is a New York-based artist who creates abstract sculptures, paintings and prints that provide an autobiographical cultural insight into the life of their author. Gibson's vast influences range from 19th-century Iroquois beadwork to contemporary street art, radically different inspirations that glamorously collide within this man's work. Jeffrey says that part of his practice was a reaction to a nostalgic and romantic vision of pre-colonized Native American life. Gibson’s practice often includes sculpted pigmented silicone, in addition to the simultaneous use of oil, acrylic and spray paint - the variety of materials allow Gibson to create layers of patterns in low relief or thick impasto.   Jeffrey Gibson was born in Colorado, but he spent the majority of his childhood moving from one place to another. Being exposed to such diversity early on played a major role in establishing young Gibson's initial artistic impulses, as explained by the artist himself: This unique combination of cultural perspectives and exposure are essential to understanding Gibson’s artworks that combine and transform seemingly disparate references drawn from both Western and non-Western sources. In 1995, Gibson earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Art Institute of Chicago, followed by a Master of Fine Arts received from the Royal College of Art in 1998. It should be noted that the aforementioned Master's Degree was paid for by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians as Jeffrey was always supported by his community who praises itself on taking care of its own.  The centerpiece of Gibson's art is his nomadic lifestyle: I bring together varying aesthetics of each place I visit. Some have had specific cultural aesthetics, language barriers, cultural barriers, etcetera. These differences funnel through me, a queer Native male born toward the end of the 20th century and entering the 21st century. I consider this hybrid in the construction of my work and attempt to show that complexity. Beside his nomadic lifestyle, Jeffrey also finds inspiration in events that revolve around dancing, especially anything that's got to do with the life work of Leigh Bowery and his dramatic nightclub persona. Events such as raves provide contrasts as rural and urban venues, serving as spaces for dancing, movement, and dramatic fashion/regalia. Gibson is fond of using both Western and non-Western techniques as the means getting to an end are not so important as the result of their usage.   Jeffrey Gibson provides us with a unique investigation of Native American stereotypes observed through the prism of cultural critique, iconography and found objects. Highly aware of his identity and all of its aspects, this man's art navigates the space between formal abstract language and Native American totems, offering an original set of abstract sculptures, paintings and prints that celebrate multi-cultural lifestyle. In many ways, Jeffrey Gibson opens his soul to the viewers who are observing his work as he tends to channel all the deepest emotions into his art, unfiltered and not willing to compromise on any creative or factual front.

Cranio,"If you’re an artist working in the streets, they are so much more than a simple location for your art. Streets become your window to the world, a way to communicate with the others, to tell a story about yourself and that you deem is important enough. Fabio de Oliveira Parnaiba, better known as Cranio, is a Brazilian artist who began his artistic journey on the streets of Sao Paolo. In addition to the beautifying his home city, and many cities throughout the world, he also started painting. The blue Indian characters have become his trademark. It all started as his desire to show the indigenous people from Brazil and all the troubles they’re facing in the unforgiving contemporary world, but the process has outgrown its original idea, and the characters and the situations they’re finding themselves in are now almost universally applicable.  His mediums are acrylic on canvas and spray paint on walls, but he likes to mix them up a little, so some of his artworks are spray paint on canvases. All of his characters are reminiscent of Brazil, whether they are wearing a sports jersey or carrying a Brazilian flag, but the themes Cranio explores are universal. Inspired by the life around him, he tackles the issues of political corruption, environmental disasters, or the ever-present and never-stronger consumerism. His themes are dark indeed, but instead of depicting the things exactly as they are, he rather includes the elements of humor, making them easily digestible without giving up on the significance or the power of the messages that the artworks are sending. The artist is heavily influenced by cartoons and the work of Salvador Dalí.   His moniker is actually his childhood nickname he got while he was in school. He was the smartest kid in his class, so the other kids named him Cranio, someone with a big brain. Cranio means Skull in Portuguese and Brazilian. He began his art journey in 1998 by writing his name on the walls, influenced by graffiti from other artists he saw around the city, like Os Gemeos. It wasn’t long until he started drawing characters that gave a bit of humor to the grayness of the concrete walls. He’s a self-taught artist, who learned everything he knows about the art on the streets. Over the years, his technique and context, which are essential for his work, have improved drastically, without affecting the sharpness of the style he’s known for.   It was luck that he was born in Sao Paolo, a city with a very strong culture of graffiti and a capital of the graffiti world today, according to many art critics. Cranio’s work is a mix of street art and fine art, where he depicts his own life, everything he sees, hears, or lives through. There is a lot going on in the world today – a lot of good, but a lot of bad as well. The artist takes great pleasure in criticizing everything he deems wrong. He is represented by Vroom & Vaorssieau in Amsterdam.  ",1044
Alphonse Mucha,"Establishing the basis of the Art Nouveau style, Alphonse Mucha was famous for his commercial posters with dense patterns that initiate the interest in natural forms and decoration instead of the anonymity of mechanical production. From Vienna and Paris to Chicago where he introduced the American audience with new art, Mucha worked in various mediums, including jewelry, furniture design, and theater scenography. Celebrating femininity, the Femme nouvelle was a favorite subject, used in both allegorical and decorative purposes, glorified as the counterbalance in the masculine world. Besides his commercial work, Mucha was a great patriot, often dedicated to projects of nationalist character, celebrating the history and culture of his country.  Mucha was born in 1860, in the town of Ivancice, Moravia, today Czech Republic. As a chorister at the Saint Peter’s Cathedral in Brno, he experienced his first revelation, confronting the richness of baroque art. Since drawing was his favorite preoccupation as long as he remembered, in 1879, he moved to Vienna to work as a stage-set painter for a major theatrical design company. Unfortunately, the business was destroyed in fire, and Mucha was forced to return to Moravia and accept the job of a decorative and portrait painter. Still, the Austrian capital left a great impression on the young artist who particularly admired the work of Hans Makart. Making portraits, he met Count Khuen of Mikulov who hired him to paint murals in Emmahof Castle and was so impressed by Mucha that paid for his formal training at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. During his Munich period, the artist worked as an illustrator for Krokodil magazine, among the others, that helped him to develop distinctive calligraphic style. By 1887 he was in Paris studying at the Academia Julian and Academie Colarossi, where the painters Eduard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard were among the most respected. They introduced the art as something that should be normality of everyday life, forming the basic ideas of future Art Nouveau conception of art in daily life. Mucha earned a living doing a job of illustrator for different magazines and advertisements and shared the studio with Paul Gauguin. Two artists created under the very interesting conditions, assembling the room with music, exotic objects and entertainment, gathering bohemian writers, artists, and musicians. The is one old photograph that shows the scene where Gauguin in his underwear plays the Harmonium, reflecting the positive mood in their studio. Thanks to the various company, it was here that Mucha had a chance to experience the occult with August Strindberg, experimenting with hypnosis with Albert de Rochas and Camille Flammarion.   His career drastically changed in 1894 on the day before Christmas. According to legend, young Mucha was working for printer Lemercier when Sarah Bernhardt, the most famous actress of that time, came into their office desperately looking for somebody to design the poster for her new show Gismonda. Since all employees were home for Christmas, Mucha took the opportunity and created his first poster. The diva was so pleased, that she signed a six-year contract with the artist who produced many promotional posters, costumes and stage sets for her and quickly became famous himself. “Le Style Mucha” as people started to call his style, was so popular that collectors stole his posters from billboards. Advertising perfumes, beer, bicycles, biscuits, and cigarettes, he erased the difference between fine and commercial art, merging the consumerism with philosophy by claiming that art must be more than visual pleasing. Under the influences of the Pre-Raphelites, Hans Makart and Japanese graphics, Mucha created innovative and distinctive approach that particularly distinguish his female representations with flowing hair, pastel clothes and haloes of light or flowers that evoke the religious scenes he saw throughout his childhood. His style was dynamic and graceful, emphasizing its elegance with curving lines and Byzantine borders, lettering and frames. During this period, he was also experimenting with a different kind of sculpture and applied arts, associating with the goldsmith Fouquet in whose store he created so-called “Mucha world “, a unique decoration made of statues, stained glass, mosaics, fountains and special lightning.   The first, and the most famous series of his decorative panels, The Seasons (1896), became so popular that he produces it in at least two more sets. Although the theme of personification of the seasons was nothing new, Mucha’s female characters incorporated into nature have brought the freshness by showing their moods in accordance with the season they represent. After successful exhibitions in Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Munich, Brussels and London, he was already recognizable as the world’s greatest decorative artist. With the aim of capitalization of his ideas, he published two books – Documents Decoratifs (1902) and Figures Decoratifs (1905), filled with design for jewelry, stained glass, wallpaper, furniture and figures that became the Art Nouveau bible. Mucha’s spiritual side find his expression in his illustrated book Le Pater (1899), decorated with Byzantine, Catholic, and Masonic symbols. It also reflected his belief that art should have a moral and political purpose, considering its ability to spread the message. As a great patriot, he dreamed of creating an epic painting cycle as an illustration of the Slav history that would encourage the Slavic quest for freedom.   Collecting funds for his monumental intention, Mucha traveled several times to the USA, where, in 1909, finally met Charles Crane who became his financier for the next 20 years. Fully dedicated to his Slav Epic, he occasionally worked on some other projects, but with the same inspiration and message, as the Lord Mayor’s Hall ceiling with an inscription ""Though humiliated and tortured you will live again, my country!"". In 1918, when Czechoslovakia finally gained its independence, Mucha started to design nation’s postage stamps, banknotes, and coat of arms. His studio in Zbiroh Castle was overcrowded with his giant canvases whose painting requested extensive research because of which Mucha traveled throughout the Balkans, consulting with historians, ensuring that every detail was depicted precisely which gave international attention to his Pan-Slavic idea. In 1919, he finished the first phase which was a part of traveling exhibition through America, attracting 50 000 visitors per week. The final canvas, No.20, The Apotheosis of the Slavs, was done in 1926, representing the new republic under the peace rainbow, protected by Christ. This large series consisted of 20 paintings in total and he took eighteen years to finish them. In 1928, on the occasion of 10-years anniversary of the Czechoslovakian republic, Mucha donated the Slav Epic to the city of Prague, accepting also to create stained glass window in St. Vitus Cathedral.   Although the war was all the more certain, he began the triptych The Three Ages – reason, wisdom, and love (1936-38) considering the first two as the extremes that could only be united through wisdom. In preparation for this monumental work, Mucha made numerous sketches of details, but his final touch missed as a result of his failing health. But even the bigger obstacle was the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939 when the artist was labeled as a reactionary and interrogated by Gestapo, which is even more undermined his lung infection. Alphonse Mucha died in Prague on July 14, 1939. Despite his today popularity, in the time of his death, his style was considered outdated and his greatest work, Slav Epic was stored for twenty-five years. The communists seen his art as decadent and bourgeois and his son Jiri Mucha devoted his life promoting his father’s artwork and reviving his reputation. During the 60’s, in accordance with the increasing interest in Art Nouveau, Mucha’s style became popular and copied on posters of British bands and for one San Francisco happening in 1966. In spite of his association with Art Nouveau, Mucha rejected the label, insisting that art was eternal. ",1045

Kim Keever,"The American artist Kim Keever can be described as a modern-day hydroponic equivalent of Jackson Pollock - instead of a canvas, though, Keever drizzles paint into a 200-gallon fish tank, creating some great effects while doing so. When you first glance upon the works of this man, you may find yourself questioning which medium you are observing - Keever is actually a photographer and has mastered a technique completely his own that you will soon come to fully understand. Prepare to meet a man that had the dreams of improving booster engines for NASA's spaceships - and had all the skill in the world to back that ambition - but ultimately built his legacy through creating incredible pieces of visual art.   Kim Keever was born during the year of 1955. Guided by his father, he always aspired to be an inventive technician - with these goals in mind, Keever studied Engineering at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA. He was an outstanding student and was predicted to have a good future in the profession he chose for himself. During summers, Keever would intern at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), where he worked on missile skin technology and jet nozzles - yes, fields very far from what made him famous later in life. As a matter of fact, Kim had excellent grades and a work ethic very fitting with NASA, so naturally, the young man envisioned himself as a future key part of this organization. However, something changed inside Keever as he one day decided to quit the thermal engineer position and test himself as a full-time artist, primarily a painter. Keever started his career in the midst of The New York City of the 1970s, in a time that Andy Warhol was taking the world by storm and the emerging art of subway graffiti was at its arguably highest peak. Instead of simply joining some of the popular movements thriving in New York, Kim desired something more personal than that, something more individual and unique in character. As an overture that led to his photography, Keever spent nearly two decades as a traditional painter and printmaker until he discovered the style and subject that would become his trademark in the year of 1991. Being a huge fan of the landscape painting, especially the styles of Romanticism, the Hudson River School and Luminism, Kim turned to themes he both knew and loved. Although his vocation changed radically, he has always drawn on his original occupation by retaining a scientific and investigative process in his work, as you will soon come to see.    After a friend gave him a fish tank through a coincidental turn of events, Keever began constructing complex tableaux composed of model train props that were actually submerged in water and meticulously lit to create a hyperrealistic landscape and a beautiful sight. This was quite a turn from traditional oil painting and it proved to be a hand in glove fit with Keever who fell in love with the results. He started experimenting with different perspectives, lighting tricks and the optical properties of water, all in order to create photographs that looked like they were taken outdoors. At the peak of this series, the works of Keever looked a lot like the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich. Over time, his themes took a step towards more minimal, conceptual and expressionistic techniques, walking away from his already mastered landscape style. Soon, Kim started submerging plaster objects in the tank, tracking their decomposition with photographs every step of the way. Ultimately, these decisions led Kim Keever to full abstraction and complete lack of form. His latest work is stripped of all imagery and is purely focused on the diffusion of liquids and the interplay of color and light. Much of his work can be connected with Kim's childhood days in Virginia Beach, where the young artist would make dams in the tidal areas and observe the water’s behavior, how it reacted to sudden changes. Keever also spoke of how his father used to pour the condensed milk into a pitcher of water to demonstrate the principles of hydromechanics. Although he was learning about physics at the time, little did Keever know that this experience would become a vital part of his subconsciousness and reappear later in his life in a completely different form.    As you have no doubt already concluded on your own, Kim Keever leaves much room to chance when creating his pieces - the artist himself delightfully explains the benefits of such an approach: I couldn’t create what randomness gives me. Furthermore, his staged scenery is characterized by a psychology of timelessness. Although Kim Keever is somewhat reluctant to fully reveal the process of his work, he has given clues about some basic stages - he adds Sears Easy Living paints and some other chemicals to the fish tank, after which he has approximately 15-20 minutes before the liquids diffuse, leaving the 200-gallons of murky brown water in their wake. During the exciting moments when the colors are battling and whirling, Keever shoots thousands of photos, ultimately choosing one or two images and disregarding all the rest. Of course, next is the dreadful process of cleaning the tank of all the colors so that the whole set could be prepared for a new session. Such a short time that Kim has at his disposal before all the paint becomes useless brings much tension to his work and also adds much deeper psychology placed behind his photos - of these circumstances his materials find themselves in, Keever states that they only need to hold up for that ephemeral moment, and then it doesn’t matter anymore. Even though his method is one hundred percent modern, Keever's technique is much closer to the Old Masters than you think - much of the contemporary art revolves around the term of anti-beauty, whilst Kim constantly seeks to incorporate as much grace in his work as humanly possible. Most of Keever's works are available at Kinz Tillou Fine Art.   Although Keever’s dabblings in aquatic abstract photography are miles away from his disciplined, rigid days of engineering, we can safely say that Kim has found his true calling. Do not get us wrong, we are not saying that Keever was not a good engineer or anything of the sort, but the sheer beauty and uniqueness of his work are beyond words and it would have been a real shame if the artist stuck to his original profession. The only problem we can find with his artwork is the harsh reality that the originals he makes can not be somehow preserved and shielded from the inevitable conclusion - this, however, does not bother Kim Keever too much, as he explains himself: I try not to be sentimental, that is the destroyer of beauty. With that sentence, we leave you to enjoy the pure grace of this artist's portfolio.  ",1049

Sara Pope,"Sara Pope is a British artist best known for her boldly colorful, seductive paintings and prints of glossy lips. Thanks to her rich experience when it comes to the world of fashion, Sara’s inspiration is rooted in glamorous Haute Couture style – she captures the powerful allure, temptation and sensuality conveyed by a pair of sexy lips as the perfect symbol of femininity. Our lips can communicate a multitude of emotions, and are integral to us reading a face, the artist claims. When it comes to Sara’s artistic processes, she calls her method working from the elbow, alluding to legendary Jackson Pollock’s painting from the hip.  Sara Pope was born in Stoke-On-Trent, which is a city in Staffordshire, England. Her artistic development was quite abrupt and exciting . Sara was initially studying mathematics, but soon after the graduation, she realized that her creative side is growing stronger and that she couldn’t ignore it, despite her non-artistic degree. She was exceptionally brave and persistent, so she moved to Barcelona in order to attend a course in graphic design. Eventually, she has spent a couple of years in Spain and started working in magazines as a designer and art director after she returned to the UK. During her graphic design studies, Sara has rediscovered her strong passion for shoes and avant-garde fashion, which lead to her collaboration with several designers and fashion brands, such as Paul Smith, Lacoste, Felder and Felder, Baby Phat and more. She has also designed a collection of shoes for Fashion Week show and got involved with various freelance catwalk projects for many famous brands. Besides her commercial work, Sara has spent a lot of time developing her own artistic style. She started experimenting with both oil and acrylic colors and she focused on creating shiny, attractive colors, in order to add some pop appeal. The major themes of her work are strongly related to her own experiences and thoughts on them - commercial fashion, consumerism, the importance of beauty and the impact of media and advertising strategies on our lives.   Sara’s paintings usually start with a photographic shoot, a model and, of course, some makeup. She asks her models to think about various positive emotions, such as love, happiness or perhaps flirtation, she photographs the results and cherry-picks the most successful ones. Her technique is quite elaborate and original – she normally uses a few thin coats of oil placed over each other, in order to achieve a glass-like, light-reflecting quality. Many of her works belong to limited edition category because the artist prefers working in small and unique series, in order to pay special attention to each and every picture or print. Hyperrealism is the major theme of Sara’s work and also a great metaphor for the highly controlled world of fashion and advertising. The artist’s main goal is to obscure the original photographic elements of lips and models by transforming them through the use of vivid colors. Sara’s work has achieved a quick success once she had her first shows and sold her early pieces in 2012. In 2014, the artist had her first international show in Italy, about which she was interview by the Sky News, BBC News, BBC Radio and various newspapers across the globe. In 2015, she had another important exhibition, this time in London, in collaboration with the prestigious American brand BareMinerals, as they were about to launch a new lip gloss brand. Finally, in 2016, Sara Pope had splendid exhibitions at Lights of Soho and Lacey’s Gallery and she was commissioned to paint a piece based on the life story of Jenny Sealey MBE, who is a creative director at Graeae Theatre.   Sara’s artworks might seem simple and straightforward at first, but beneath the obvious glamor and gloss, there is much more. The artist raises important questions about the ideals of modern beauty and about the transience of celebrities and fashion stars, which are the inseparable parts of our contemporary culture as seen on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other important social media channels. To sum up, Sara’s works offer a powerful thought-provoking punch and this is the reason for their rapidly growing popularity. She currently exhibits with several galleries, such as Lawrence Alkin Gallery and Jealous Gallery in London, Art Republic in Brighton, George Thornton in Nottingham, Workhouse Gallery in Harrogate and also 166a Arte, which is located in Florence, Italy.

Tunga,"Brazilian artist Tunga, born Jose de Barros Carvalho e Mello, was a talented and eclectic creator who worked in sculpture, installation, photography, poetry, and video. His large-scale installations and sculptures were always capable of transforming galleries and museums into dreamlike environments thanks to the most versatile materials such as plastic, thread, and recycled objects. Even though his process was materially intensive, Tunga’s practice was also clearly conceptual. His works are intellectually puzzling, they resist certainty and confuse the audience. For instance, in his piece from 2007 entitled At the Light of Both Worlds from 2007, Tunga hung from a gallery ceiling a massive assemblage of bones and bronze replicas of classical art - this outstanding work is a unique commentary on the intrinsic balance between life and death.  Born in Palmares, Pernambuco in 1952, Tunga moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he completed the course of architecture and urbanism at the University of Santa Ursula. Thanks to his father, writer Gerardo de Mello Mourão, Tunga knew Brazilian modernism very early. He began his career in the early 1970s. At the time, he made prevalently drawings and sculptures. His figurative images revolve around daring and controversial themes, such as in the famous series entitled Children's Masturbation Museum, from 1974. He collaborated with the magazine Malasartes and he was also in contact with the newspaper A Parte do Fogo in the 1980s. He worked as a lecturer at the Philosophy Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of Santa Ursula. Tunga won one of his most important awards already in the mid 80s - he was awarded the State Government Prize for an exhibition held at the Rio Grande do Sul Art Museum in 1986. The following year, he engaged in videography and performed the video Nervo de Prata, made in partnership with Arthur Omar. In 1990, he received the Brasília Prize for Plastic Arts and, in 1991, the Mário Pedrosa Prize of the Brazilian Association of Art Critics (ABCA) for the work Preliminaries of the Incest Palindrome. In order to carry out his work, Tunga investigated various areas of knowledge such as literature, philosophy, psychoanalysis, theater, as well as the topics of natural and biological sciences.   At the beginning of the 1980s, Tunga became the holder of solid theoretical and philosophical training and he held conferences at university institutions in Rio de Janeiro. His erudition and theoretical foundation was reflected in an increasingly conceptual art production, involving research in different areas. At the same time, he was able to articulate aesthetic influences sought at different moments in art history, such as Baroque, Romanticism and modernist avant-gardes. During the 1980s, his works began to present a self-referential character, which led the artist himself to define them as a set of works linked together. This feature was taken to the extreme in the video Nervo de Prata from 1987, made in partnership with Arthur Omar. He gave original treatment to sculptural work, which according to the critic Carlos Basualdo was conceived by Tunga not only as the static volume, but also as the grouping of these expanding forms and the relation between them. His work eventually gained international reputation, leading him to exhibit in important spaces for the plastic arts in Europe and the Americas. In 1982, he divided the Brazilian Pavilion of the 41st Venice Biennial with the sculptor Sérgio Camargo. He also held solo exhibitions at the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art in 1989, New York Museum of Contemporary Art in 1994, Luhring Augustine Gallery in 2002 and Louvre in Paris in 2005, among many other venues. Tunga also had many posthumous group exhibitions organized throughout 2016.   Tunga is nowadays considered one of the most emblematic figures of the national artistic scene. He was also the first contemporary Brazilian artist to have his work exhibited in the iconic Louvre Museum in Paris, which is one of the greatest honors an artist can receive in a lifetime. Tunga's works can be found in the most prestigious permanent collections of museums like the Guggenheim of Venice, various galleries and institutions such as the Inhotim Institute. In order to create his authentic works, Tunga consulted trustworthy sources such as the view of natural and social sciences and he used new materials like chains, electric wires, lamps, and rubber. His work is known for its extensive symbolism achieved through the use of bones, skulls and needles.  Tunga lived and worked in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ",1054

Regarded as pioneers of early conceptual and media-based art, their collective became a model for artist-initiated activities. They initially began working together in 1967 in Toronto, and from 1968 through 1993, they divided their time between Toronto and New York. All three artists were involved in the scene in and surrounding Passe Muraille, which was the beginning of their collaboration. Their first headquarters was in a house at 78 Gerrard St, where they lived with actor Daniel Freedman. They were soon joined by Sharon Venne, who lived across the street. Their name was coined by a mistake, after the exhibition space listed the title of the group's work as the name of the collective. Drawing from popular culture and mass media and being influenced by the writing of Marshall McLuhan, William Burroughs, and by the Situationist International, they examined themes such as self-mythologization, spectacle, appropriation, parody, media deconstruction, an ironic interest in commerce and the semiotics of advertising language. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, their work addressed the AIDS crisis, resulting in some 75 temporary public art projects.",1060
Kolkoz,"Kolkoz is a French art duo composed of Samuel Boutruche and Benjamin Moreau. They work in a diverse range of mediums that spans from video to sculpture and installation. They explore the intersection of the real and the virtual, crafting complex installations and playful public interventions.  Samuel Boutruche is born in 1972 and Benjamin Moreau is born in 1973 and they both live and work in Paris. They took part in numerous group and solo shows, including solo shows at Ostquai, Basel, Switzerland, Miami Marine Stadium Key Biscayne, Miami, USA, Collins Park, Miami, USA, UCCA, Beijing, China and Zona Maco Arte Contemporaneo, Mexico, and group shows at The Delano Hotel, South Beach, Florida, USA, Festival Hanarart, Nara, Japan, MAMO Centre d’art de la Cité Radieuse, Marseille, France, Belvedere, Vienna, Austria, Almaty, Kazakhstan and Badu, Azerbaijan. The duo plays, thinks and imagines in virtual. Their practice can be described as a quest, a life concept pushed to the extreme, to the point of reaching the artists' own everyday life where reality or virtuality merge. This interchange between the real and the virtual realms is a continuing theme. In the 2012 work Luna Park, the artists re-imagined the lunar landing site of Apollo 11 as a live football pitch on Miami Beach.",1061
Kikuo Saito,"A Japanese painter, set designer, and theater director, Kikuo Saito was known for his bright and calligraphic pieces, often covered in gestural strokes of color. Born in 1939 in Tokyo, Japan, Saito began painting at the age of 17 and worked for 3 years as a proctor and studio technician at the workshop of Sensei Itoh, an established Japanese painter, where he gained an understanding of both the traditional arts of Japan as well as contemporary movements. He came to New York City in 1966, where he worked as an assistant for such eminent painters as Helen Frankenthaler, Kenneth Noland, and Larry Poons. Saito's work is characterized by richly saturated colorscapes with delicately drawn lines. Typically, he would paint on the floor, circling and moving over the canvas to create each composition, resulting in rhythmic, gestural and expressionistic works. In addition to his painting practice, Saito is known for his poetic theater works that incorporated costumes, light, music and dance. The composition of many of Saito's paintings was in fact significantly influenced by and in dialogue with the geography of his theatre productions. He often incorporated investigations of alphabet in his works, both real and made-up, legible and obscured, speaking to moments in his personal history. ",1062

DALeast,"DALeast is a Chinese artist whose unusual paintings, which are sometimes hundreds of feet across, can look 3D and as if they were created out of thousands of tiny metal shards, but in fact they have been spray-painted onto a flat surface.  DALeast was born in Wuhan, China where he has been making art since he was three; 'I worked on everything when I was in China - painting, sculpture, installations, synchronizing performance, and digital art. He studied Sculpture at the Institute of Fine Arts. Animals are his main subject matter. His animals are typically depicted in two disconnected parts, often disintegrating at the center or falling away at the sides. Within every piece of DALeast’s art, a pop of color observed in the background brings his subject to life. This allows him to focus on the intricacy of his technique while delivering his final product. The use of fractured imagery and contrasting backgrounds serve to give his art a breath of energy and soul that can sometimes be lost in art with a more somber subject matter.  His use of animals, he says, reflects the human condition. DALeast is self-described as “currently a human being.” He has worked on a vast number of projects, starting in 2005, throughout Beijing, China, as well as South Africa, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Namibia, the United States, and many other countries throughout Europe and Africa. He lives in Cape Town, South Africa but spends six months of the year travelling and has tagged walls on nearly every continent.",1065
Marina Abramovic,"Today, she is a celebrity. A mentor to the likes of Lady Gaga and the haute society’s curious ones. She exhibits at the most prestigious venues, has an own institute and an artistic method named after her. But if we look back only three to four decades in the past, we will find Marina Abramović to be somewhat of a rebel, a young woman who dared to try and redefine contemporary art in a rather turbulent society. Her path was not light, but neither was her determination, as this often disputed, but undeniably intriguing woman rose from a burning star, into stardom. With a name that echoes loudly throughout the contemporary art sphere, Marina Abramović can also be described as a Serbian artist whose vanguard works proclaim the use of her physical body as the basis of her creative vocabulary. During her long career, Abramović pushed both physical and mental boundaries in order to explore themes of emotional and spiritual transfiguration, authoring some of the most mesmerizing performance acts to date. Expanding her performative practice, she utilized a variety of creative mediums over the years, such as sound, video, sculpture and photography. Often, she was a pioneer in this approach, effectively setting the stage for all younger generation artists who desired to become part of the performance genre[1].  Marina Abramović was born in Belgrade on the 30th of November in 1946, in what was then Yugoslavia. Both of her parents, Vojin Abramović and Danica Rosić, were Yugoslav Partisans during the Second World War, experienced in combat and officially announced National heroes. In the post-war years, both of the artist’s parents were awarded high positions in the Yugoslav government, as distinguished members of the young communist society. Strong and dedicated to their political beliefs, Abramović’s parents enjoyed a prosperous lifestyle, but led a rather strict household, marking the young artist’s life for good. In one of her numerous interviews, Abramović described her family as having been Red bourgeoisie.  Due to their commitment and the passion for the new state of Yugoslavia, Marina's parents were always away from home, which meant that the young girl had to spend the most of her time with her grandparents. Her grandmother was deeply religious and Abramović describes her upbringing with the following statement: I spent my childhood in a church following my grandmother's rituals – candles in the morning, the priest coming for different occasions. Furthermore, the artist’s uncle was the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Varnava, a fact which was not looked upon with sympathy at the time by the establishment. Perhaps it was this obvious dichotomy in lifestyles Marina Abramović experienced as a child that triggered such a strong proclivity towards the arts and the free thinking, and finally, towards the exploration of self.  When Marina was six years old, her brother was born. This may have served as a sort of wake-up call to her parents who started living with their children at that point. By Abramović's own acclaim, her mother had an extremely militant approach to raising her two children and she was no stranger to beating them as well. From the moment Marina started living with her parents, strict lifestyle was a necessity. However, she was also provided with piano, French, and English lessons. Interestingly, she took an early interest in art and rather enjoyed painting during her childhood, yet she never took any sort of art lessons. She was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade between the years of 1965 to 1970. Even in her college days, Abramović was still tightly grasped by her militaristic mother who had a say in all aspects of her life. In an interview published in 1998, Marina described the relationship she had with her mother during the time she was a student in Belgrade: I was not allowed to leave the house after 10 o'clock at night till I was 29 years old. All the performances in Yugoslavia I did before 10 o'clock in the evening because I had to be home then. It's completely insane, but all of my cutting myself, whipping myself, burning myself, almost losing my life in the firestar, everything was done before 10 in the evening. Additionally, her parents had a terrible marriage which was no stranger to long verbal fights and even physical confrontations. Abramović finally escaped her mother's clutches in 1970 when she set her sails for Zagreb, wishing to complete her post-graduate studies at the Academy of Fine Arts. She did so in 1972, after which she taught at the Academy of Fine Arts at Novi Sad until 1975. She was also implementing her first solo performances during that period[2].   Between the years of 1971 and 1976, Marina Abramovic was married to Neša Paripović. Among other things, he is considered to be one of the key protagonists of conceptual art in Serbia during the 1970s. When the marriage between Abramovic and Paripovic came to an end, Marina went to Amsterdam to perform a piece. After seeing the state of Netherlands' scene at the time and the overall acceptance of her work, Marina decided she would like to stay in Amsterdam permanently. Both her earliest work from Yugoslavia and her more mature works from Netherlands have been pioneering, to say the least. She used her body in an extreme way no other has done so before her, transforming it into both the subject and the medium of her art. Exploring the physical and mental limits of her own well-being, she has withstood pain, exhaustion and danger in the quest for emotional and spiritual transformation - the main aim of her performance acts[3]. Ever since she arrived in Amsterdam, her main concern was creating artworks that ritualize the simplistic actions of everyday life, such as lying, sitting, dreaming and thinking, in a way that they become a manifestation of a unique mental state[4]. By presenting the public with such notions, Abramovic became arguably the most important member of the generation of pioneering performance artists that includes the likes of Bruce Nauman, Vito Acconci and Chris Burden.   From 1975 until 1988, Abramović performed alongside the German artist Ulay (his real name is Frank Uwe Laysiepen). The duo became an international sensation and represent one of the finest long-term collaborations between any two artists to date[5]. Since Ulay was a like-minded artist, Marina and him had no problems connecting on every creative level. Much of their work together was concerned with gender identity and the topics revolving around sex. Arguably the most notorious one of them all was Imponderabilia from 1977, a performance in which they stood naked while facing each other in a museum’s tight and narrow entrance, forcing visitors to squeeze between them and, in so doing, to choose which of the two to face. The couple traveled extensively and some of their works, such as the Nightsea Crossing, were performed in more than a dozen locations around the world. Some acts were controversial and some delightfully charming, but all of them managed to attract mass attention from the local audience and media. When they finally decided to end their relationship in the year of 1988, they symbolically marked the dissolution with a performance act in which they walked from separate ends of the Great Wall of China and met in the middle in order to say goodbye[6]. After the famous Abramović - Ulay duo came to an end, Marina returned to solo work in 1989 after taking a short one-year break from performing.   Since ending her relationship with Ulay and going her separate way, Abramovic has taught and lectured extensively in Europe and America. Among the places she held lectures are the Hochschule fur Bildende Kunst in Hamburg and the famed Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Her teacher roles were rewarded in 2004 when Marina received an Honorary Doctorate from the Art Institute in Chicago. This, however, was not the only award Abramovic got during her career. She was awarded the Golden Lion for Best Artist at the 1997 Venice Biennale for her extraordinary video installation/performance piece titled Balkan Baroque. In 2003, the artist received the Bessie for The House with the Ocean View‚ a 12-day performance held at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York, the city serving as Marina's home to this day. The performance artist remained active on the creative front as well for all those years as some of her finest pieces were produced during this time. In 2005, Abramovic presented Balkan Erotic Epic at the Pirelli Foundation in Milan, Italy and at the aforementioned Sean Kelly Gallery in the Big Apple. That same year, she held a series of performances called Seven Easy Pieces at The Guggenheim Museum, events which were awarded the prize for the Best Exhibition of Time-Based Art by the United States Art Critics Association. In the spring of 2010, she had her first major retrospective in the United States at The Museum of Modern Art and simultaneously performed her durational piece The Artist is Present[7] for more than 700 hours. This retrospective boasts of having been seen by a staggering number of viewers - more than 850,000 visitors set across Marina during the duration of The Artist is Present. In 2011, a theater piece authored by Robert Wilson called The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic. Similarly entitled, the 2012 HBO documentary concerning the performance artist's life was premiered at Sundance Film Festival in Utah and The Canadian Film Premiere in Toronto. Many other performances followed, and in the meanwhile, her work was also featured in many large-scale international exhibitions, such as the Venice Biennale and Documenta VI, VII and IX.   Working in an extremely broad range of media in order to achieve her creative goals, Marina Abramović can literally be described as an icon of performance art. There is simply no studying or disusing this art form without at least mentioning Marina's name. Although Joseph Beuys can be credited with forming and establishing performance art as a valid medium, Marina Abramović is the one that investigated and ultimately set the range of this art. She is the one that explored how far the boundaries of performance art can go if one is truly committed to their work, raising the bar to a point that we do not see anyone reaching anytime soon. In other words, ”The Grandmother of Performance art” is a genuine pioneer and someone who paved the way for many younger artists who followed in the same creative path. This artist's works can be found at Me Collectors Room and kunzt.gallery.  References:   ",1066
Konrad Klapheck,"In Konrad Klapheck’s work comically absurd, sexually indicative and magnified cartoonlike everyday objects had found its depiction in a very strict, strong, vivid and stark style. This German graphic artist and painter have become famous for his Typewriters – repetitive series of monumental and ironized typing machines that he created in 1955; in a manner to which he is still persistently loyal, and although connected with pop art has actually been invented earlier when he was a 20 year old student.  Klapheck was born in Düsseldorf in 1935 as a child of two art history teachers at the Düsseldorf Art Academy, where he graduated under Bruno Goller in 1956. He started exhibiting in the late 50’s and spent time in Paris where he had contact with the circle of surrealist, even participated in their last show in the gallery L’Oeil in 1965. In the 70’s he was working on engraved plates and in the late 90’s he turned to painting portraits and figures, mostly of his friends, colleagues or celebrities. Later, he even started painting interior nudes that were based on old work with erotic and autobiographic elements. After 2004 he begins new series of paintings portraying jazz musicians and big bands, in which he wanted to highlight the solitude of the soloist in front of the crowd and the band. In 2009 he was invited to create the official poster for Roland Garros tournament.  Regarding Klapheck‘s art, it combines elements of realism, Surrealism, and Pop art. Realism can be traced in the choice of painting drills, sewing machines, clocks, water taps and showers, telephones, irons, shoes, keys, saws, and car tires – painted with obsessive precision. But despite that, objects in ominous forms are sinisterly isolated, magnified, ironically both anthropomorphized and architectural. The influence of other artists, for example Duchamp, Man Ray, and Max Ernst, is seen in his treatment of mechanical objects and the irony with which they are rendered. In his own words: My main weapons are humor and precision. Only the coldness of precision allows the translation of the fire in the soul, and only humor allows the translation of what we have seen. I must put no limits to my subjectivity in order to obtain objective canvases. All the enigmas and solutions of life are inside oneself.   During his long career, Klapheck exhibited worldwide one of the most prominent retrospective shows being at the Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam in 1974 and the latest Klapheck Paintings and Drawings at the Kunstpalast in Düsseldorf in 2013. He was a professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf since 1979 until his retirement in 2002.   ",1067
Louise Bourgeois,"Best known for her representations of the female form and dreamlike imagery, Louise Bourgeois was a versatile French artist who produced amazing pieces with goals of exploring topics of sexuality, pain and fear. Early in her life as she was starting a career in Paris, Bourgeois was associated with the concepts of Surrealism due to the regular use of fantastic elements within her printed pieces. However, when she relocated herself to the Big Apple in the late 1930s, Louise began to be primarily focused on sculpture, crafting unique biomorphic forms which made her globally renowned. Her choice to use unconventional materials such as resin, latex and cloth was underlined by a recurrent interrogation of the relation between male and female genders, leading many to a conclusion Bourgeois was a prominent representative of the Feminist movement. However, the artist herself did not pledge allegiance to any one movement, preferring to work in between all of them and simply pick the concepts that she saw as useful.  Louise Joséphine Bourgeois was born on the 25th of December 1911 in Paris, France. She was the second kid of a total of three children born to parents Josephine Fauriaux and Louis Bourgeois. Her family owned a gallery that dealt primarily in antique tapestries, so logically Louise and her siblings were exposed to much artworks and their authors early on. At one point whilst she was still a toddler, Bourgeois' family moved out of the French capital and set up a workshop for tapestry restoration below their apartment in Choisy-le-Roi, a commune in the Val-de-Marne department in the southeastern suburbs of Paris. Although the lack of any real local competitors active within their family trade, Louise's parents had a rather turbulent marriage. Her father had an often not very well hidden affair with both the Bourgeois' English teacher and her nanny. These activities really made left their emotional mark on the young girl and this behavior displayed by her father effectively shaped the entire creative career she will have in the future. Since Bourgeois did not meet her father's expectations due to her lack of ability within the field of tapestry, he was oftentimes rude towards her[1]. By her own acclaim, Louise began to truly hate him for his explosive temper, domination of the household and for teasing her in front of others. This relationship will prove to be a pivotal moment in shaping Bourgeois's future in it's every aspect.   During the year of 1930, Bourgeois began attending classes at the Sorbonne, studying mathematics and geometry as these subjects were extremely based on stability - something the young women valued deeply at this point of her life. However, after she was shocked by the sudden death of her mother two years later, Bourgeois decided to abandon mathematics and to begin studying art. Her father, of course, opposed her choice as he always did, but this time, Louise was not to be stopped. After she graduated from the Sorbonne in 1935, Louise began studying art in Paris, first at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and later at the prestigious École du Louvre. After graduating from both institutions, Bourgeois continued to expand her ability by attending private classes at independent schools. During this period, the artist mostly focused on her father's infidelities and rage problems in order to seek out inspiration, literally finding the creative impulse in her childhood traumas. However, the rough relationship with her dad was put on a hold at one point, as he helped his daughter to open up a print store beside his tapestry workshop. Around that exact time, Louise met her future husband. His name was Robert Goldwater[2], an American art historian noted for his pioneering work in the field known as naive art. After the two got hitched in 1938, they relocated to New York City the same year as Goldwater resumed his career as the professor of the arts at New York University Institute of Fine Arts. Meanwhile, Louise attended the Art Students League of New York, studying painting technique under Vaclav Vytlacil and evolving her skills within the mediums of sculpture and print.     Early years of her life in The Big Apple were marked by both difficulties of a transition to a new country and troubles with staying pregnant. Additionally, Louise had massive difficulties to enter the exhibition world of New York City. Her artworks from this time were mostly made from junkyard scraps and driftwood, assembled and used in a way to make upright wood sculptures. In a sense, Bourgeois simply continued to investigate her traumatic past by creating disturbing wooden sculptures. Slowly but surely, she developed more artistic confidence and managed to hold her first solo show in 1945. It did not go as well as she had hoped, however, and the public did not receive her concepts with much euphoria. She took some time off after that, focusing on other things in her life. Nine years later, Bourgeois joined the American Abstract Artists Group, beginning collaborations with several contemporaries such as them Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt. She also befriended the likes of Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock. Being a part of the American Abstract Artists Group, Louise finally stopped using wood and began relying on marble, plaster and bronze to consist her structure. However, she continued to investigate her concerns like fear, vulnerability and loss of control. Artworks such as Femme Maison (1946) and Torso self-portrait (1963) all depict the feminine body and it was because of the approach to such topics that Bourgeois was branded by the public as a feminist. She denied this statement on numerous occasions[3], but much of feministic theories could be linked to this artist's pieces. She has been quoted to say statements such as My work deals with problems that are pre-gender and For example, jealousy is not male or female.  In the early 1970s, Bourgeois started holding gatherings at her home in Chelsea, calling them Sunday, bloody Sundays. These improvised salons would be filled with young artists and students whose work would be critiqued by Louise - it was the ruthlessness in critique and her dry sense of humor that lead to the horrific naming of these meetings. However, she did inspire many young students to make fine art despite such an approach. About a decade later, Bourgeois received her first retrospective show in 1982, held at the prestigious Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Louise continued to experiment and advance her art down different paths for the remainder of her career, primarily focusing on sculptures. During the year of 2010, which will unfortunately prove to be the last year of her life, Bourgeois used her art to speak up for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) equality. She created the now iconic piece titled I Do, depicting two flowers growing from one stem. Although she still stayed clear of feministic radical ideas, Bourgeois said that everyone should have the right to marry[4]. Louise died of heart failure on the 31st May of 2010, at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She had continued to create sculptures until her death, with her last piece being poetically finished the week before the fatal day.   Although many critics and pundits remained determined in their endeavor to uncompromisingly mark Louise with the feministic brand, her art is ultimately much better described as sexual. This was undoubtedly one of the most important themes present in the work of Bourgeois as all other topics she tackled could somehow be linked to sexuality. Whether she aimed at exposing passion, fragility or insecurity, Louise always relied on some level of sexuality as she saw this as one of the most fundamental aspects of both her and the lives of the rest of us. This led her to establish a unique visual language that is easily describable as one of the most honest and rawest vocabularies the 20th century as in its arsenal. This artist is represented by Hauser & Wirth Zürich, Marlborough Gallery Monaco, Me Collectors Room Berlin, and Marlborough Fine Art London. References:   ",1068
Walasse Ting,"Walasse Ting was a Chinese-American visual artist and poet, garnering critical praise and a popular following for his colorful works blending Eastern and Western style. Born in 1929 in Wuxi, China, Walasse briefly attended the Shanghai Art Academy, but always considered himself to be self-taught, learning to draw with chalk on the street at a young age. In 1952, he immigrated to Paris and became associated with the avant-garde group COBRA. In 1958, he settled in New York during the height of the Abstract Expressionist and Pop Art movements. His work began to transition from black and white abstractions reminiscent of Zao Wou-ki, to boldly colored figurative works blending calligraphic brushstrokes with splatters, splashes, and bright fields of color. His widely collected series of female nudes exemplify his embrace of this decidedly Western, vivid coloration. He befriended Sam Francis, who helped publish 1 Cent Life (1964), a book of Walasse's poetry illustrated by artists, Andy Warhol, and Francis, among others. Walasse was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship Award for drawing in 1970. Toward the end of his life, Walasse split his time between New York and Amsterdam. His works can be found in many museum collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the Tate Modern, and Centre Pompidou. Walasse Ting died in 2010 in New York. ",1069
Manolo Valdes,"Manolo Valdés is a Spanish artist, born on March 8, 1942 in Valencia, Spain. He is a painter, sculptor and a printmaker, best known for his association with the artistic group known as Equipo Crónica. Valdés enrolled the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Carlos in 1957, where he studied two years, and met Rafael Solbes. In 1964, along with colleague Juan Antonia Toledo, they founded Equipo Crónica, a Spanish manifestation of the Pop Art movement of the 1960s. Through his participation in this group, which lasted until 1981, Valdés was featured in more than 60 solo exhibitions. His works from this period often expressed political commentary, and were characterized by the use of unconventional materials and crudely-applied paint. After Solbes died in 1981, Valdés continued to work in a style that became distinctly his own and independent from that of Equipo Crónica. Finding inspiration in the styles and techniques of Old Masters, such as Francisco Goya and Diego Velázquez, Valdés incorporates and appropriates traditional motifs and compositions of art history. Valdés has received various awards, including the Lissone and Biella in Milan in 1965, the silver medal in the second International Prints Biennial in Tokyo, an award from the Bridgestone Art Museum in Lisbon, the Alfons Roig Award in Valencia, the National Award for the Fine Arts in Spain, a medal from the biennial International Festival of the Plastic Arts in Baghdad, and in 1993 the Medal of the Order of Andrés Bello in Venezuela. Along with the works he exhibited as a part of Equipo Crónicas, Valdés had over seventy exhibitions between 1965 and 1981, as many individual as collective. His work is included in public collections around the world, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Musée Picasso in Antibes, France, the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in Seville, Spain, the Kunstmuseum in Berlin, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, among many others.

NEVERCREW,"NEVERCREW is a Swiss duo composed of two urban artists, Christian Rebecchi and Pablo Togni. They have been working alongside each other since the year of 1996 and have produced numerous pieces since then, including the mediums of graffiti, sculpture, installations and other projects. From a stylistic point of view, NEVERCREW's work could be defined as a visual hybrid - it combines a simple graphical structure with realistic and formally complex elements, arranged in different spatial levels.  Both Pablo Togni and Christian Rebecchi attended the same art school where they've met and started working together. Later they've gone to the same Academy of Fine Arts of Brera in Milan where the future street due developed their united skill. Both of them have always had a tendency to build and experiment with different techniques and it’s in this that the future NEVERCREW has been able to start looking for a mutual synchronicity. Their first official collaborations were related to images for vinyls and mix-tapes of hip-hop bands, whose culture in the 90s was very much present in Togni and Rebecchi's living region. Soon, they started to focus on graffiti as their main artistic focal point, predominantly focusing on figurative compositions. From the start, the duo was inspired by hip-hop and artists like Daim and Eron, but also with avant-garde painters and thinkers such as René Magritte and Adre Breton. Pablo and Christian have never been interested in looking for a specific and unique realization technique, but rather in finding the combination that could allow them to build the concepts and convey contents in a way closer to themselves. The idea of construction and composition is therefore probably the one that better defines NEVERCREW's work - in their structures, natural elements relate together in a decidedly precarious and often forced balance. By putting such concepts into action, NEVERCREW hopes to stimulate reactions and thoughts about issues that are dear to them as individuals and which both of them consider important for our societies. In order to achieve such goals, Pablo and Chrisitan search for a visual involvement based on the presence of the elements in the space, looking for where the viewer can feel directly compared with the subjects as the subjects are to each other.    From NEVERCREW's unique street painting work emerges a new surreal reality, at the same time logical and illogical, composed of memories, past experiences and personal thoughts. Living and inanimate elements, mechanical and natural elements, inorganic materials and animals - all these components coexist alongside each other within the fantastic works of Pablo Togni and Christian Rebecchi. All of these features mesh with each other and form one of the most unique and instantly recognizable collections of artworks we've seen present on the streets in a very long time.  ",1072
Hebru Brantley,"Hebru Brantley, a Bronzeville-native living and working in Chicago, explores personal and cultural memory in his art. Born in 1981, Brantley earned a B.A. in Film from Clark Atlanta University, and has a background in design and media illustration. Taking themes from his 1980’s upbringing, Brantley uses a creative process akin to free-form journaling, using a variety of surfaces and media including wood, spray paint, coffee and tea. His work delves into political and social issues with a conscious focus on playful insight and the optimism and possibilities of youth. Brantley draws influence from an array of pop culture icons, comic book heroes, Japanese anime and the bold aesthetics of street art pioneers Jean Michel Basquiat, Kaws and Keith Haring. Brantley’s recent focus is to share energetic narratives, moments of reality from his life and the lives of his peers, mixed with fantastical fiction, to create a fragmented environment of make believe. Spray paint is often at the forefront of these mixed-media illustrations, working in part to de-contextualize the levity of cartoon imagery, and bring a critical edge into the white cube. From this, Brantley has developed his own unique style and identifies as an Afro-Futurist. Recognized nationally for public works and solo shows in Chicago, Hebru Brantley has exhibited in San Francisco, Atlanta, Miami, Seattle, Los Angeles and New York, among others. He was the winner of the Redbull Curates Chicago contest, and exhibited at Scope art fair in December 2012. Brantley has been commissioned by Skyy Vodka, Nike and Tyra Banks. He created the Lollapalooza poster for the 25th anniversary of the festival in 2011, and is exhibited regularly by Tim Yarger Gallery in Beverly Hills.",1073
Gilbert and George,"Art for all. A simple yet surpsrisingly compelling credo that truly underpins the work of the famous Gthilbert & George artistic duo. Formed from Gilbert Proesch (born on the 17th of September in 1943, San Martin de Tor, Italy) and George Passmore (born on the 8 January in 1942, Plymouth, United Kingdom), this long lasting and successful collaboration creates within and around the fields of Conceptual, Performance and Process art. Being active since the mid-1960s, Gilbert and George first attracted the public's attention for their interesting performances. Since then, the two expanded their practice to a variety of media, including books, film, painting, postcards, photomontages etc. All they make is underlined by a strong Pop sensibility and the appropriation of mass media images. Interestingly, although working in a variety of media, Gilbert and George refer to all their work as sculptures.   Gilbert Proesch and George Passmore first met on the 25th of September of 1967 while they were both studying at the prestigious Saint Martin's School of Art in London. Although the two clicked almost instantly on all levels, they would later joke that the main reason why they came together was because George was the only person who could understand Gilbert's rather poor English[1]. In 1968, they moved in together, finding a new residence in the Fournier Street, Spitalfields, East London. Interestingly, they still live in that 18th-century house to this day, although it has been restored to its original decor as the duo gained more and more fame. East London was a big part of their work from the start and Gilbert & George see this part of England's capital as a unique microcosm. According to George, nothing happens in the world that doesn't happen in the East End of London. Ever since they decided that alternative art was something they would both be interested in, Gilbert and George's approach to creating was always anti-elitist. Adopting the slogan of Art for All, the duo desired to aim their creativity at wider masses, not restraining their work with the formal boundaries of art circles. As was said earlier, the two refer to all of their creations as sculptures. Even their drawings were called Charcoal on Paper Sculptures. During the year of 1970, Gilbert and George first performed their famous Singing Sculpture piece at Nigel Greenwood Gallery[2]. For this performance, they covered their heads and hands in multi-coloured metalised powders, stood on a table and sang along to a recording of Flanagan and Allen's song titled Underneath the Arches. The masked performers would also dance to the music, sometimes for a day at a time. Since then, these masks have been regarded as this duo's characteristic creative uniforms.   Since The Singing Sculpture performance, the pair would often call itself living sculptures. They would insist that their art is a pivotal part of their lives, a concept that never really changed as they were maturing. Soon after the success of their first performance, Gilbert and George started what may very well be their best-known practice - large scale photo works, known simply as The Pictures. The early style of such pieces was black and white, but as The Pictures were becoming more frequent, the creative pair added hand-painted red and yellow touches. They would also utilize black grids on these artworks, emphasizing that the entire compositions are rather complex and well planned. The Pictures' addressed a wide variety of subject matter including religion and patriotism. Often called visual love letters from us to the viewer by the authors, such images would also often feature their authors within them. Jack Freak Pictures is, to date, the largest series of this kind created by Gilbert & George. Many of The Pictures was controversial, namely the series from 1986 that was seemingly glamorizing the underground subculture of the East End, presenting the audiences with depictions of skinheads and some racial remarks. Other works contained nudity, depictions of sexual acts and bodily fluids, so notoriety was never an issue for this duo[3]. Now, sixty years after they started to make art, Gilbert and George are regarded as living legends. They were the subject of the BBC documentary Imagine, presented by Alan Yentob in 2007. The pair won many awards in their time, such as Regione Lazio Award in 1981, the Turner Prize in 1986 and Lorenzo il Magnifico Award in 2007. In the year of 2005, Gilbert and George were chosen to represent the United Kingdom at the Venice Biennale. It should also be noted that they claim that they married in 2008[4].   Over the course of the last sixty years, this creative duo explored a wide breadth of subjects pertaining to race, sexuality, religion and mortality, investigating all the regular themes all of us struggle with to some degree. Insisting that their lives and their art are inseparable from each other, Gilbert and George create art that is both whimsical and obscene, provocative and comical, inspiring and offensive. Such uncombinable blends of emotions naturally come from a very complex artistic aim, best explained by the two artists themselves: Our subject matter is the world. It is pain. Pain. Just to hear the world turning is pain, isn’t it? Totally, every day, every second. Our inspiration is all those people alive today on the planet, the desert, the jungle, the cities. We are interested in the human person, the complexity of life. These artists are represented by White Cube Bermondsey London and White Cube Mason's Yard London.  References:   ",1074
Niki de Saint Phalle,"Can weapons, with their original intention of destruction, be used for something else? Is it that strange that a rifle can be used for art? Niki de Saint Phalle was a French-American artist, known for her shooting paintings, Nanas sculptures, and Tarot Garden, a monumental sculpture park, her biggest artistic endeavor. At one point in her life, she had found herself living in the very same type of situation that she strongly resented – married young and with a child. After a nervous breakdown, she emerged completely different. She evolved from a person who first used art as a therapy in order to feel better, into a master capable of channeling all of her emotions and current socio-political-cultural issues, creating works that still draw attention.  Born is a rich aristocratic family, Saint Phalle’s father, André, was a wealthy French banker, and her mother, Jacqueline Harper was an American, but raised in France. Young Catherine was the second of five children. Soon after her birth, facing with aftershocks of the Black Tuesday, the French wing of the Great Depression finally forced her father to close his finance company. They lost their fortune, moved to the USA, thinking that they would fare better there. They took their eldest son, John, with them, while Niki, just a few months old at the time, was sent to live with her grandparents in Nièvre. After three years, she joined her family in New York, where her father had worked as a banker once again, and the whole family once again had all the privileges of being rich. She attended the prestigious Brearley School in New York, ending up expelled for painting fig lives of the school’s sculpture. Saint Phalle was also expelled from a convent school in Suffern before finally graduating in 1947 from Oldfields, a boarding school outside of Baltimore. As a teenager, Niki de Saint Phalle worked successfully as a fashion model. In 1949, Niki’s photographs appeared on the cover of Life, and in 1952, she was featured in French Vogue.  When she was 18, Saint Phalle eloped with Harry Mathews, someone that she knew through her father. He began noticing her, despite their previous acquaintance and various meetings during various social occasions, in autumn of 1948, in a train dining car. As Mathews recollects: “…when a svelte young woman walking past turned to say ‘Hello, Harry’, with a smile that illuminated her beautiful face to an extent that left me without breath or speech. A moment later, I went after her. Fortunately we were on a train – she could hardly escape.”[1] Putting romance aside for a moment, one of the reasons they were so drawn to each other was that they had had similar upbringings in genteel, moderately well-to-do families who subscribed to the tenets of upper-class New York WASP society. Both of them were artistically inclined, oversensitive, overtly rebellious romantics, and we bonded together as such. They began having an affair, which only heightened their impatience with the state of our lives and led, soon after he’d joined the navy for a year, to their elopement. Lara, their first child, was born in 1951. In the early summer of 1952, they moved to Paris, where Saint Phalle was modeling for Vogue and Elle and studying to be an actress, while her husband, following his music studies, was learning to become a conductor.   She painted and experimented with various styles and techniques, and after her first year of studies, she had a promising career ahead of her. However, by the autumn of 1953, she had gone through and was emerging from a violent nervous breakdown, caused by the facts she had married young and somehow accepted the conservative values and the lifestyle of her family that she wanted to reject so badly, and the memories of her father raping her when she was 11.[2] After becoming intermittently hysterical and virtually out of her mind, Niki de Saint Phalle was first treated with a barbarous treatment – a series of electric shocks. Luckily, she soon ended up in the hands of a humane psychiatrist, who in a month or two of narcoanalysis restored her to mental health. Somewhere in between the shocks and the analysis, she was put to a clinic, where she began doing her first collages, and soon after that her first paintings. They were so extraordinarily original and compelling, that her husband, following her energetic example, gave up all thoughts of a musical career and began writing for the first time since 1949. Several important moments occurred briefly after. On a modeling assignment in Paris, Saint Phalle met Hugh Weiss, an American painter, who strongly encouraged her to pursue her artistic career. Another important moment was the visit to Barcelona, Spain, where she was struck by the work of Spanish architect Antonio Gaudí and his park Güell. The park sparked her interest in creating her own sculpture garden, combining natural and artistic elements, and inspired her experimentation with different unusual materials in her artworks. Apart from being deeply affected by the work of Antonio Gaudí, Saint Phalle's art was also influenced by various other artists, such as Henri Matisse, Paul Klee, Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Willem de Kooning, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jackson Pollock. Upon returning to Paris, she met the artist Jean Tinguely. In 1960, she divorced Harry Mathews, giving him the custody of their children, and started sharing a studio and living with Tinguely, eventually marrying him in 1971.    After moving to Paris in the 1950s, Saint Phalle continued with artistic experiments and had her first exhibition in Switzerland in 1956. In the early 1960s, her artistic works had already evolved from being just a therapy. Instead, it had become a bold act of defiance, reclamation of space for herself, and for women. She began to articulate these ideas and combining them with other social and political issues - amidst an atmosphere of radical ideas, from civil rights, anti-war and anti-violence protests to campaigns for women’s rights and sexual liberation across the West. In her own words: “In 1960 I was a very angry young woman. Angry at men and their power. I felt that they had robbed me of my own free space in which I could develop myself. I wanted to conquer their world, to earn my own money. Angry with my parents who I felt had raised me for the marriage market. I wanted to show them that I was somebody, that I existed and that my voice and my scream of protest as a woman was important. I was ready to kill.”[3] The shooting paintings were born out of this anger. Their creation involved polyethylene bags of paint, which would create spontaneous effects when shot by a rifle. She also became a member of the Nouveau Realism group of artists which included Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely, Arman, Christo and Jacques Villeglé. In 1961, her first solo exhibition was held in Paris. That is when she became friends with the artist Larry Rivers and his wife Clarice. Clarice’s pregnancy inspired her to start creating voluptuous female figures, Nanas, which expressed her thoughts about the position of females in society. Nanas were made of papier-mache, cloth and yarn. She worked with Tinguely and Per Olof Ultvedt on a project for Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden in 1966. They created a large installation, consisting of a Nana, whose vagina served as a door to her internal body. The installation provoked a strong reaction from the public. At that time, Niki was introduced to Rico Weber, the Swiss artist, with whom both Saint Phalle and Tinguely collaborated later. That was also the period when Niki worked on Le Paradis Fantastique with her future husband. It was a commission for the French Pavilion at Expo Montreal, Canada in 1967. While she was working on Le Paradis Fantastique with Jean, Saint Phalle’s lungs were severely damaged by polyester resin toxic fumes. Polyester, her favorite material, was the cause of her recurring health problems. In the early 70s, she spent some time in the Swiss mountains, recuperating from her illness. In 1974, she produced three large Nanas, which were placed near the town hall in Hannover, Germany, and nicknamed after three important women of the town. She also created inflatable Nanas that were distributed in America.   The year when she visited Barcelona and saw Gaudi’s Parc Guell was the year when Niki started fantasizing about making a monumental sculpture park, her biggest artistic endeavor. Ferdinand Cheval’s Palais Ideal and Simon Rodia’s Watts Towers just fueled her wishes. An old friend, Marella Caracciolo Agnelli, shared her dream of building a fantasy garden, inspired by 22 Tarot cards. With Agnelli’s help, Saint Phalle acquired a parcel in Tuscany, Italy. The foundations were laid in 1978, and two years later, the construction of the first sculpture began. Niki spent many years completely immersed in the creation of her dream place. After nearly 20 years of intensive work, financial and health problems, the garden was opened in 1998. It contained vibrant mosaics and colossal sculptures, based on the Tarot cards symbols. The Garden was made with the financial help of the Agnelli family, donations and the sales of her perfume. This oeuvre is so imposing that it seems that everything she created previously led to the Tarot Garden, and everything made subsequently looks like an aftershock. As mentioned above, the idea came from Parc Guell – upon seeing, it, she immediately knew that sometimes in the future she was going to realize a similar project. In the end, the garden became much more than a simple variation on a concept she had come across elsewhere. It was her absolute, on-going concern, and a deep, captivating theme for life. But, why tarot? What was about it that Saint Phalle found so appealing? Tarot is an ancient, venerable set of cards, with picture representations of archetypal, elementary situations upon them. They describe existential, human experiences and psychic states. The history behind the cards is not clear – some claim they originate in Egypt, others claim that Moses himself received these cards from the high priests of Egypt and then brought them to Israel. Whatever the case may be, Saint Phalle was deeply convinced that the cards have a considerable meaning. She saw the Tarot Garden as a site which crosses boundaries into the religious and where everyone is potentially able to have a direct experience of the archetypal content of the Tarot.[4] When rumors of monsters rising up in the hills nearby began appearing in the Italian village of Capalbio, no one knew where they were coming from. Or who was their ‘mother’. Soon it became widely known who was behind the idea, as monsters were already altering the lives of the people around. Some of them, like the postman Ugo Celletti, had been helping to create the monsters. It can be difficult to describe the significance of the sculptures. For some, they are dazzling. For others, deranged. Some find them transcendent, others tawdry. Truth to be told, who would expect that a house-size sculpture of a sphinx, with mirrored blue hair and a bright red crown, a flower blooming on one of her breasts and a lavender heart on the nipple of the other sits amid peaceful olive groves and ochre fields grazed by horses and sheep? They are Grand, in every way. Saint Phalle intended the Tarot Garden, a fourteen-acre sculpture park built atop Etruscan ruins, to serve as both “a sort of joyland” and a demonstration that “a woman can work on a monumental scale.” She considered it to be her life’s work.[5]   In 2002, the artist died of emphysema, a chronic obstructive lung disease, after six months in intensive care in La Jolla, California. But, who was really Niki de Saint Phalle? Is she going to be remembered for that nervous breakdown after which she as an artist emerged? Or for her relationship with Jean Tinguely? What is more important, her paintings or her sculptures? Her entire career is unique and memorable. Built at the juncture of art, personal charisma, and political gesture, all of her works deserve a place in the history of art. She is represented by We Art Partners and David Pluskwa Art Contemporain.  References:  ",1075
Jacques Lipchitz,"Jacques Lipchitz, born Chaim Jacob Lipchitz, was the Lithuanian-born French artist best known for the Cubist works he made in Paris during the early 1900s. At first, under the influence of his father, he studied engineering, but in 1909, supported by his mother he moved to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian.   In Paris, Lipchitz became close friends with such neighbors as Pablo Picasso, Chaïm Soutine, and Amedeo Modigliani. He looked toward a wide array of non-European cultures for inspiration and was especially inspired by African art. In his sculpture, Lipchitz used clay and plaster to explore the formal language of Cubism. His work in geometric and abstract styles gained him a reputation as the major figure of Cubist sculpture. In 1912 Lipchitz exhibited at the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and the Salon d'Automne with his first solo show held at Léonce Rosenberg's Galerie L’Effort Moderne in Paris in 1920.   In 1924 Lipchitz became a French citizen and married Berthe Kitrosser, whom he had known since 1915. At this time he experimented with abstract forms he called “transparent” sculptures. Later he developed a more dynamic style, which he applied with telling effect to bronze compositions of figures and animals. Two important pieces from that period are “La Joie de Vivre” and the powerful, 7 feet tall, totemic “Figure”.  After several prosperous decades in France, Lipchitz fled to New York in 1942 to escape the Nazi occupation. Arriving with only the few possessions he carried, the artist soon developed a robust new body of work and was hailed as one of the leading European expatriate artists. He was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the Third Sculpture International Exhibition held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the summer of 1949. In 1954 a Lipchitz retrospective traveled from The Museum of Modern Art in New York to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and The Cleveland Museum of Art. In 1959, his series of small bronzes ""To the Limit of the Possible"" was shown at Fine Arts Associates in New York.  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Lipchitz' work was shown in the United States, Europe, and Israel. Beginning in 1963 he returned to Europe for several months of each year and worked in Pietrasanta, Italy. In 1972 his autobiography, co-authored with H. Harvard Arnason, was published on the occasion of an exhibition of his sculpture at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Lipchitz continued his prolific and diverse output until the end of his life, including work on numerous commissions for public sculptures in the U.S. and abroad. Jacques Lipchitz died on Capri, Italy, on May 16, 1973.   ",1076
Peter Blake,"Sir Peter Thomas Blake is an English pop artist, best known for co-creating the sleeve design for the Beatles’ album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and designing the cover for Bob Geldof’s Band Aid single Do They Know It’s Christmas and the Live Aid promotional poster. His other notable work is with another famous British band The Oasis for whom he designed the album cover for Stop the Clocks. Although Andy Warhol was the one who brought art to the larger audience, many people consider Peter Blake to be the godfather of the movement. Besides paintings, he is also known for his interest in images taken from popular culture which is inserted into his collages.  Born in 1932 in Dartford, Kent, Blake was educated at the Gravesend Technical College school of Art, and the Royal College of Art. During the late 1950s, Blake became one of the best known British pop artists. He produced paintings with the feel of a collage. The artist’s biography ansd pieces include images from published works, news and advertisements, and music hall entertainment. Blake often painted wrestlers, and some of his pieces resemble advertisements or posters. In 1959, inspired by reproductions by Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, Blake began to paint collage-like pictures of musicians and filmstars and to produce assemblages made of recycled material, postcards and other items. Alongside his collages Blake also worked with the medium of imitation: Painted collages, imitated pin-up-boards and locker doors, enlarged, painted postcard motifs and painted adaptations of posters appeared. In the Young Contemporaries exhibition of 1961 in which he exhibited alongside David Hockney and R.B. Kitaj, he was first identified with the emerging British Pop Art movement. Blake won the John Moores junior award for Self Portrait with Badges in 1961. He came to wider public attention when, along with Pauline Boty, Derek Boshier and Peter Phillips, he featured in Ken Russell's Monitor film on pop art, Pop Goes the Easel, broadcast on BBC television in 1962.[1] From 1963, Blake was represented by Robert Fraser placing him at the centre of swinging London and brought him into contact with leading figures of popular culture.   On the Balcony (1955–57) is a significant early work which remains an iconic piece of British Pop Art, showing Blake's interest in combining images from pop culture with fine art. The work, which appears to be a collage but is wholly painted, shows, among other things, a boy on the left of the composition holding Édouard Manet's The Balcony, badges and magazines. It was inspired by a painting by Honoré Sharrer depicting workers holding famous paintings, Workers and Paintings. Blake painted several album sleeves. He designed the Beatles sleeve for Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967, with his wife Jann Haworth, the American-born artist whom he married in 1963 and divorced in 1979. The Sgt. Pepper's sleeve has become an iconic work of pop art, much imitated and Blake's best-known work. Producing the collage necessitated the construction of a set with cut-out photographs and objects, such as flowers, centered on a drum (sold in auction in 2008) with the title of the album, which was a quick success. Blake has also made sleeves for the Band Aid single, Do They Know It's Christmas? from 1984, Paul Weller's Stanley Road from 1995 and the Ian Dury tribute album Brand New Boots and Panties. He also designed the sleeves for Pentangle's Sweet Child and The Who's Face Dances from 1981, which features portraits of the band by a number of artists. In 2015, Peter Blake has created the Everybody Razzle Dazzle design for the Snowdrop. Everybody Razzle Dazzle is the third in a series of Dazzle Ship commissions to mark the centenary of World War I, and was co-commissioned by 14-18 NOW, Liverpool Biennial and Tate Liverpool, in partnership with Merseytravel and National Museums Liverpool.[2]   In 1969, Blake moved from London to Bath, where he became inspired by characters from Shakespearean plays and English folklore. In the early 1970s, he made a set of watercolour paintings to illustrate Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass using a young artist, Celia Wanless, as the model for Alice and in 1975 he was a founder of the Brotherhood of Ruralists. Blake moved back to London in 1979 and his work returned to earlier popular culture references. In 2006, Blake designed the cover for Oasis greatest hits album Stop the Clocks. Familiar cultural icons which can be seen on the cover include Dorothy from Wizard of Oz, Charles Manson (replacing the original image of Marilyn Monroe, which could not be used for legal reasons) and the seven dwarfs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Blake revealed that the final cover wasn't the original which featured an image of the shop Granny Takes A Trip on the Kings Road in Chelsea, London.   In 2008, Blake painted a pig for the public art event King Bladud's Pigs In Bath in the city of Bath. A fan of Chelsea Football Club, Blake designed a collage to promote the team's home kit in 2010. He also designed a shopping bag for the Lucky Brand Jeans company for the holiday season. As part of 'The Big Egg Hunt' February 2012 Sir Peter Blake designed an egg on behalf of Dorchester Collection. Blake created the carpet which runs through the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's Middlesex Guildhall building. Around his 80th birthday, Blake recreated the Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band cover art using pictures of people he had met throughout his life. He used computer software to produce the art, instead of the plywood pieces that were used to create the original design. In 2012, to mark his 80th birthday, an exhibition was held at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester to celebrate the artist's long associations with music called Peter Blake and Pop Music.[3] In 2014, Peter Blake exhibited his illustrations inspired by Under Milk Wood at National Museum Cardiff. His paintings have been on exhibited at the Tate Liverpool, the Sir Peter Blake Music Art Gallery in Leeds, and the Holburne Museum in Bath.   Peter Blake became a Royal Academician in 1981, and a CBE in 1983; in 2002 he was knighted as a Knight Bachelor for his services to art. In 2011, Blake was awarded an honorary DMus from the University of Leeds, and marked by the public unveiling of his artwork for the Boogie For Stu album. On 18 July 2011, Blake was awarded an Honorary degree for Doctor of Art from Nottingham Trent University. Sir Peter Blake is known as a passionate collector always in search for the records of popular culture and news trivia, something that not only inspired his work, but it satisfied his passion as well. The artist is represented by kunzt.gallery, The Cat Street Gallery and Weng Contemporary.  References:  ",1077
Kenneth Noland,"Living and working in the time when Abstract art movement reached its height, Kenneth Noland emerged in the wake of the first generation of the New York School. Interested in breaking away from the prevailing aesthetic of abstract expressionism in the 1950s and 1960s, he began to experiment with geometric shapes, these evolving into a new kind of picture, where large areas of color were more dominant than any particular shape, which would give their name to Color Field painting, the dominant school of American abstraction after Pollock. In the 1950s, Noland made his most famous series of works, which included nearly two hundred paintings of concentric circles that seemed to float in the center of the canvas, animated by pure, pulsing color.  Kenneth Clifton Noland was born on April 10th, 1924 in Asheville, North Carolina. Aged 14, he visited the National Gallery in Washington and was amazed by the works of Claude Monet. His father - who was a pathologist and an amateur painter - gave the boy his art materials and Kenneth began to paint. During World War II, Noland was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served in the Air Corps as a glider pilot and cryptographer. He was also stationed in Egypt and Turkey. After demobilisation in 1946, Noland enrolled at Black Mountain College, an experimental school in his home state of North Carolina, where he studied under a German-born American artist and color theorist Josef Albers, as well as under Ilya Bolotowsky, an abstract painter, and professor who introduced him to neoplasticism, a style of geometric art invented by a Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. At Black Mountain, the young artist became interested in Paul Klee, specifically Klee's natural color sense. Noland’s first solo exhibition was held at the Galerie Creuze in Paris in 1949 after moving there in 1948 to study for a year with a Russian-born French sculptor Ossip Zadkine.   After returning to the United States, Noland settled in Washington, where he taught at the Institute of Contemporary Art from 1949 to 1951 and at the Catholic University from 1951 to 1960. In the 1950s, Noland also met and developed important associations with many artists including the established sculptors David Smith and Anthony Caro, as well as critic Clement Greenberg who introduced him to Abstract Expressionism. In the early 1950, he taught night classes at the Washington Workshop Center for the Arts where he befriended an American painter Morris Louis. Two friends traveled to New York City in 1953 where they met an abstract expressionist painter Helen Frankenthaler and visited her studio. It was an influential experience for Kenneth and Morris, who adopted her “soak-stain” technique of allowing thinned paint to soak directly into the canvas, creating a liquefied, translucent effect that strongly resembled watercolor and revealed the canvas surface. Returning to Washington, D.C., they began to produce the major works that created the Color Field movement in the late 1950s.   Kenneth Noland's colorful concentric circles, targets, chevrons, stripes, and shaped canvases were among the most recognized and admired signatures of the postwar style of abstraction known as Color Field painting. Inspired by European modernism and closely related to Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting is a style of abstract painting characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. He also helped establish the Washington Color School movement. Preoccupied with the relationship of the image to the containing edge of the picture, Noland created a series of studies of concentric rings or bullseyes (targets), which used unlikely but great color combinations. This also led Noland away from his friend Morris Louis in 1958.    In the early 1960s, Noland continued to experiment with color, eventually pioneering the use of the shaped canvas in many of his compositions. Shaped canvases are paintings that depart from the normal flat, rectangular configuration. Canvases may be shaped by altering their outline while retaining their flatness. In these series of paintings, the edges of the canvas became as structurally important as the center. During the next two decades, he produced extremely irregular and asymmetrical shaped canvases, which resulted in ever more multiplex structures of highly refined and controlled color and surface integrity.  In 1954, Kenneth Noland's work was included in the Emerging Talent exhibition at the Kootz Gallery in Manhattan. His painting In a Mist (1955) was selected by Dorothy Miller for her traveling exhibition Young American Painters, organized for the Museum of Modern Art in 1956. One year later, Kenneth Noland was given his first solo exhibition in New York and in 1964 he was included in the Venice Biennale. The same year, he participated in the exhibition Post-Painterly Abstraction curated by Clement Greenberg at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which subsequently travelled to the Walker Art Center and the Art Gallery of Toronto and helped to firmly establish Color Field painting as an influential new movement in the contemporary art of the 1960s. In 1977, a major traveling retrospective of the artist’s work was presented by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. The same year, the artist was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Additionally, his work was included in numerous individual and collective shows in such art spaces as Mitchell-Innes & Nash, New York; Pace Prints, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio, among others. Noland was the first artist in residence in Computer Video Arts, Pratt Institute, New York, from 1986 to 1987.  Between 1979 and 1985, at Kathy Halbreich‘s instigation, Kenneth Noland worked on a commission for I.M. Pei’s Wiesner Building at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a remarkable project that is celebrated for its integration of art and architecture. His work is included in the many notable collections of worldwide including Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore; Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland; Kunstmuseum, Basel; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, to name a few.   The artist - who died of kidney cancer on January 5, 2010, in Maine, USA, at the age of 85 - had four children and was married four times. The explorer of color as a serialized form and the strongest expressionistic tool, Noland devoted his entire life to art and he spent his final days in the studio working on new paintings. In his latest works, the artist returned to the circles and chevrons of his early style after experimenting with different shapes for many years. Abstract, Color Field, and Minimalist painter whose most famous pieces include Beginning (1958) and Bridge (1964), Kenneth Noland has been recognized as one of the most important figures of post-abstract-expressionist painting.

Hans Hofmann,"One of the most influential art teachers and modern painters of the 20th century, Hans Hofmann was a German Abstract Expressionist painter regarded as a key figure of the color field painting technique. His work emphasized the emotionally expressive potential of color, modulating the figure-ground relationships in his paintings in a method he referred to as the push and pull, a technique similar to the one that put Jackson Pollock, Hofmann's close friend, on the map of modern art. Hans began painting in Paris where he worked alongside such titans of European Modernism as Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger and Henri Matisse. Although he would eventually be considered as one of the dominant Abstract Expressionists, it should be noted that Hofmann’s initial interest was in the illusion of the three-dimensional space, composition and the optical effects of color[1].   Hans' true name was Johann Georg Albert Hofmann and he was born on March 21, 1880, in Weissenberg, Bavaria, Germany. He spent most of his early years in Munich. After initially devoting a lot of energy towards learning about math and science, Hofmann discovered a passion for art and eventually decided to pursue an education that allowed him to learn about painting. He moved to Paris in 1904 with the help of an art patron. There, Hans Hofmann studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and at the Académie Colarossi. Over time, the young artist immersed himself in Paris' thriving art scene, meeting such artists as Pablo Picasso, Robert Delaunay, Henri Matisse and Georges Braque.   During the time he spent in Paris, the work Hofmann created followed the leading avant-garde movement of the time — Cubism. Hans' own style would come to be a fusion of various modes he learned from his friends, the leading artists of the early 20th-century modern art.[2] Before World War I started, Hofmann moved back to Germany. He was excused from military service because of an earlier respiratory condition. Unable to return to France during the war, he opened an art school in Munich in 1915 and earned a stellar reputation as an instructor of art[3]. Worth Ryder, a former student of his, invited Hofmann to teach in the United States for the summer of 1930 and, due to Germany's changing political climate, Hofmann decided to permanently settle in NYC in 1932.   After basing himself in New York City, Hofmann brought with him a deep knowledge of French art, gleaned from years spent in Paris before World War I, and this proved crucial in spreading European modernist styles and ideas in the United States. Becoming known for his abstract paintings, he became a very popular and well-liked teacher in the world of art. Perhaps even more influential as a teacher than as an artist, Hofmann counted Helen Frankenthaler, Ray Eames, Allan Kaprow, Alfred Jensen, Joan Mitchell, Wolf Kahn, Lee Krasner, Louise Nevelson and Frank Stella as his top students. In addition to teaching, Hofmann also continued to make his own art, producing work that was created by dripping and splashing paint onto a canvas. By 1960, he was considered a leading abstract expressionist who created vivid and inventive paintings[4]. At the age of 85, Hofmann died on February 17, 1966, at his New York City home.   It is not the form that dictates color, but the color that brings out the form. Hofmann stated this during an interview that took place in the final stages of his career and it's a big question if he was aware of just how revolutionary and influential this statement will become. In many ways, it became a trademark of Abstract Expressionism, a movement that marked the American modern art history and made New York City a valid rival of Paris in terms of artistic influence. Ultimately, Hans Hofmann became renowned as a modern art history's Great because of his explorations with the relativity of color, his push-pull technique and his ability to produce abstract effects of movement, space, and depth.

John Baeder,"John Baeder is an American painter closely associated with the Photorealist movement, best known for his detailed paintings of U.S. roadside diners.",1081
Elaine de Kooning,"A major figure in both the Abstract Expressionist and American Figurative Expressionist movements of the 1940s and 1950s, Elaine de Kooning was a prominent American painter who can easily be classified as one of the most important female artists of the 20th century[1]. She was a prolific and versatile painter, writer and teacher whose paintings featured loose and thick brushstrokes made in bold hues and executed in an energetic, improvisational style. Although Elaine de Kooning was closely associated with the New York School and the famed Abstract Expressionism current, she worked hard at developing a singular, personal style and painted in a wide array of modes ranging from realism to abstraction. Her original name was Elaine Marie Fried but she changed it after she married the legendary Willem de Kooning and took on his own family name[2].  Although she often claimed that she was born in 1920, Elaine Marie Fried was actually born in the year of 1918, in the Flatbush neighborhood of New York City. The eldest of four children, her parents were Mary Ellen O'Brien, an Irish Catholic, and Charles Frank Fried, a Protestant of Jewish descent. Elaine's mother started taking her eldest child to museums at the age of five, teaching her to draw what she saw along the way. Mary Ellen O'Brien did have some failings as a mother, but these early events shaped her daughter's future career. By the time she was in grade school, Elaine began drawing and selling portraits of children from her grade. After graduating from high school, Elaine Marie Fried briefly attended Hunter College in New York City where she befriended a group of abstract and Social Realist painters. In 1938, her teacher introduced her to Willem de Kooning at a Manhattan breakfast cafeteria - she was 20 and he was 34 years of age at the time. After that, he began to instruct her in drawing and painting, but their relationship was marked by his harsh criticism of her work - Willem even destroyed many of her drawings while they were dating. The two married in 1943.  After meeting Willem, Elaine suddenly found herself within the circle of the most prominent national artists in New York, spending time with the likes of Jackson Pollock, Jimmy Rosati, Giorgio Spavento, Milton Resnick, Pat Passlof, Earl Kerkam, Ludwig Sander, Angelo Ippolito, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still and Hans Hofmann. She often exhibited her own work alongside her husband's, very aware that it was usually overshadowed by Willem's fame. Although women were often marginalized in the Abstract Expressionist movement, Elaine de Kooning never attempted to make some distance between herself and these painters. However, she did chose to sign her artworks with her initials rather than her full name to avoid labeling her art as feminine. She made both abstract and figurative paintings and drawings of still life, cityscapes and portraits - one of her most notable portraits was the one of the American president John Kennedy[3], probably the most famous abstract portrait of a Kennedy ever made. Elaine de Kooning fused abstraction with mythology, primitive imagery and realism, treating her art as an event first and only secondarily as an image, more as a verb and less as a noun.[4] She began working at the magazine Artnews in 1948 and wrote articles about major figures in the art world. After writing about one hundred articles on various topics, she became an art critic and was the first notable American artist in the 1950s to take on this role.   The marriage between Elaine and Willem was full of affairs as both of them desired to have an open relationship. Additionally, both of them struggled with alcoholism and that eventually led to their separation in 1957. Elaine remained in New York, struggling with poverty, and Willem moved to Long Island and dealt with depression. They both continued painting[5]. She took on a series of short-term teaching job to support herself - she even spent time at Black Mountain College where she designed a stage set for Merce Cunningham and John Cage. Although separated for nearly twenty years, Elaine and Willem never divorced and ultimately reunited in 1976 when the artist wanted to take care of her sick husband. Elaine de Kooning died on the 1st of February in 1989, in Southampton, New York, a year after having a lung removed due to cancer. Sadly, she did not receive real recognition for her own achievement until a few years before she died.   Although it often seems as if Elaine Marie Fried is primarily known for her turbulent marriage with one of the greatest 20th-century modern painters, it's hard to overlook all of her contributions to the development of contemporary art. Her borderline stubborn rejection of dedicating herself to any one and only style combined with the way she treated the painterly pieces as events easily secure Elaine de Kooning's place within any list of the great modern female artists. Ultimately, Elaine's artistic range, vast knowledge of media and sheer influence on fellow artists was undeniable and it made it pretty hard for her career to stay completely overshadowed by that of Willem de Kooning. Nowadays, she is widely accepted as a separate artist who not only worked on her own style independent from her husband's work but also massively contributed to the development of Willem's concepts.

Marie Laurencin,"Marie Laurencin was a French modernist painter, printmaker, designer, and illustrator, known as one of the few female Cubist painters, along with Sonia Delaunay, Marie Vorobieff, and Franciska Clausen. Marie began her studies in porcelain design at the Ecole de Sèvres factory before moving on to painting at the Académie Humbert in Paris. Laurencin insisted on the creation of a visual vocabulary of femininity, developing a unique approach to abstraction, focused on the representation of groups of women and female portraits. While her work shows the influence of Cubist painters Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Marie’s aspiration towards more personal style can be seen as a response to what some consider to be the arrogant masculinity of Cubism.",1083
Elmgreen & Dragset,"The artist duo Michael Elmgreen  and Ingar Dragset have worked together since 1995. Their work explores the relationship between art, architecture and design. Their work is characterized by wit and subversive humor, and also addresses social and cultural concerns. Elmgreen was born in 1961 in Copenhagen, Denmark and Dragset was born in 1969 in Trondheim, Norway. The duo met in Copenhagen in 1994, when Michael Elmgreen was writing and performing poetry and Dragster was studying theater. After beginning their collaboration, they moved to Berlin in 1997. In 2006, they bought a large 1000m2 former water-pumping station dating to 1924 in Neukölln and converted it into a studio. Working at the crossroads of art and architecture, performance and installation, the duo focuses on objects and their settings, along with the discourse that can arise when those objects are radically recontextualized. Their work often draws attention to the institutions that host them and their attendant politics. They are best known for an ongoing series Powerless Structures, that feature a great number of architectural and sculptural installations in which they transformed the conventions of the 'white cube' gallery space, creating galleries suspended from the ceiling, sunk into the ground or turned upside down.

Piero Dorazio,"Piero Dorazio was an Italian painter, known for his linear, atmospheric paintings of grids crisscrossed with fluid brushstrokes and pulsating in color and texture. Born in Rome in 1927, Dorazio studied classical painting and drawing, followed by architecture. ",1085
Natalie Edgar,"Natalie Edgar is an American artist, known for her multi-layered paintings, which she creates in her unique Abstract Expressionist style. Growing up in New York City, Edgar was exposed to a profusion of art, a perfect environment for shaping the amazing and raw talent that she possesses. In 1950, Natalie started studying art at Brooklyn College, from which she graduated in 1954. She learned from some of the most prominent artists and painters of the time, including Ad Reinhardt and Mark Rothko. Moving in this kind of circle of artists, Edgar learned that the point of art is to present ideas not the art-making process. Art should be truthful and honest. She further developed her artistic expression while attending Meyer Schapiro classes.  Natalie Edgar met and fell in love with Philip Pavia, a renowned sculptor known as one of the original members who set up The Club, a group which gathered artists around the ideas and philosophies behind art. Some of the leading artists of New York art scene, such as Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman and Hanna Arendt, were frequent visitors of The Club.  Since 1980, the couple started their journey around Italy, eventually discovering Pietrasanta, a small town in Tuscany. They decided to spend every summer there. The breathtaking scenery became Natalie's second studio, and yet another ""school"" where she discovered color, volume and rhythm. From 1966 until 1988, Edgar held the position of Adjunct Assistant Professor at CUNY, teaching Art History. Subsequently, she moved to New School of Social Research, where she taught Painting until 1994. She was also a visiting professor at University of Minnesota. Among many awards, she was also a recipient of Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant in 2010.  An eminent New York artist, Natalie exhibited her works extensively in her native city, participating in both solo and group exhibitions.

Edgar's most notable exhibition was the 2014's highly acclaimed Abstract Journey, which consisted of majority of her works.  ",1086
Yaze,"Yassine Mekhnache, better known simply as Yaze, is a French self-taught artist, known for his large-scale portraits in which he tries to capture memory. Yaze was born in Lyon, France in 1979. Starting out as a graffiti writer, he moved to more traditional kind of art, working on paintings with more conventional materials. Yassine is famous for his large paintings, where he manages to perfectly combine traditional craft materials, like paper with cloth or wood, and Moroccan decoration. He also incorporates markers, which are conventionally used for graffiti.  The main subject of Yaze’s paintings is memory, which he sees as a physically experienced mental category, rather than something written in history. When it comes to his technique, he again fuses the elements of street art and traditional art, like scribing and dripping. In his large-scale portraits, Yassine juxtaposes a plan and an existence. He enriches them by using the violent red, orange and ochre. He also beautifully incorporates the white color with black lines.  Yaze has been exhibiting all over the world, primarily in Europe, Africa and Asia. He has also participated in numerous art fairs. Some of his more notable group shows include a 2010 C1TY, 18 Gallery – Magda Danysz from Shanghai, and bYrdS, a show held at the Galerie Joseph, France in 2012.

Peter Anton,"Peter Anton is an American contemporary artist best known for his large-scale sculptures of food, especially chocolates and other sweets that stimulate viewer’s memories, dreams and desires. His colorful, masterfully executed and highly detailed pieces glorify the significance and allure of food within people's lives.   Born in New Haven, the U.S. state of Connecticut, in 1963, Anton studied filmmaking at the University of Bridgeport. Fascinated by the important part food plays in people's daily lives and throughout history, Anton began making his mixed media sculptures in the early 1990s. To date, his sculptures include everything you can possibly imagine, from ice cream, lollipops, donuts and cakes to pizza, bacon, fried eggs and hamburgers.  Anton’s process of work is very specific – the artist starts with the process of eating, feeling, smelling, dissecting, and studying a new food over and over again so as to familiarize himself with a new subject. After he decides what materials and processes to use in order to get the effects and look that he demands, the artist starts with the long process of carving, sculpting, sanding, constructing, and painting his assorted media works.   Peter Anton’s work has been included in many individual and collective shows in galleries and museums throughout the United States and beyond. Some of his solo shows was on view in Guy Pieters Gallery, Knokke, Belgium; Gallery Valentine, East Hampton, NY; Unix Gallery, New York, NY; Museum Jan Van Der Togt, Amstelveen, The Netherlands; Scott Richards Contemporary Art, San Francisco, CA; Galerie Ralph Schriever, Cologne, Germany; and Galerie Pergolese, Paris, France, among others.

Lady Pink,"Lady Pink is the pioneer of female graffiti writing. Over 35 years she has been working as a graffiti artist, inspiring many young women and men to pursue the life of self-expression and creativity. Nowadays she is a true legend, inspiring women with meaningful life philosophy. She made her first graffiti when she was only 15 years old. Starting from 1979, over the period of 6 years she painted subway trains. She had first solo exhibition at 21 and her paintings are included in important collections like the MET, The Whitney Museum, The Museum of the City of N.Y. and others. This powerful woman went to great lengths to fight for equality, justice, and women's rights.  Lady Pink, born as Sandra Fabara in 1964, in Ambato, Ecuador, began her career in the late 70's, determined to fight for women's rights and gender equality. She came to the USA when she was only 7 years old and she has been raised in NYC. Graffiti were her passion, as an act of rebellion, they helped her to express herself as a young independent female artist. She wanted to stand up to those who opposed her potential, and graffiti writing gave her the opportunity to do so. Her unique style and feisty personality took her to places where no female graffiti artist was before. She is a true first lady of graffiti. Rebellion is just a small part of her artwork. Everything she does, from paintings to murals, is firmly grounded in reality. Her pieces are not made just for the sake of revolt, they are empowering and informative. One of her earliest canvases The Death of Graffiti pictures a girl standing on the mountain of spray cans pointing out to a white painter train. Lady Pink made this pieces when she was 19 years old, and at the time, she was painting subway trains. Their white surface was the perfect canvas, clear and shiny in a polluted big city, they traveled downtown and shared the art all around.   She chose the name Lady Pink, inspired by English romantic literature and posh aristocratic culture. After first few graffiti she started tagging the name all over the subway cars when not many women graffiti writers existed. Her love for graffiti initiated when she was a high-school student, but she never graduated due to a graffiti related shooting she had nothing to do with. Lady Pink has joined a few groups of artists, such TC5 and TPA (The Public Animals). TC5 is a boy crew that has been around since the early 1970’s and is the one of most respected crews ever. By the early 90s, Lady Pink started meeting other women graffiti artists and she was thrilled that she finally found sisters to paint with and participate in various exhibits and projects. A major turnover in her career occurred after the release of an independent feature film Wild Style, directed by Charlie Ahearn. The movie tells a story of a graffiti artist and his struggle to maintain the lifestyle, love relationship and to stay true to following his passion. The artist played a leading female role, and after the premiere, in 1983 she gained worldwide recognition. Then came the collaborations with other artists, especially interesting was the famous Jenny Holzer, with whom she worked on canvas-based series. Some of their collaborative paintings have sold in the 6 figures. Lady Pink does not label herself as an activist, in fact, she does not put a label on anything she does and creates.   Pink wants to express her private opinion to public work, without any censors, although she will never reveal the idea in fullness. Art is about a binary relationship, and the audience is free to make assumptions and interpretations as they like. Since the 80's when the graffiti art started getting mass appeal and attention, political and social activism has been more or less censored in the same manner. That is one of the reasons Lady Pink separates her private work from the public one. However, one should keep an eye on the small details with hidden references. She cleverly states out what is important, and warmly put her artwork open to interpretation. Her private tradition is to practice mindfulness and to be as sensible as possible to the community. She also runs a mural company with her husband Smith, who is another legendary graffiti writer. They have done many commercial commissions for high-end clients all over NYC as well as community murals in needy neighborhoods. In addition to this, Lady Pink is also a visiting artist in schools, who teaching mural painting to teens. She still continues to exhibit her paintings in fine galleries and museums all over the world, because that is her primary passion.  ",1090

Nancy Graves,"Nature lover, art-world sensation, and a creator who couldn’t be pigeonholed to only one medium – all this could be used to perfectly describe Nancy Graves, an American post-minimalist artist. Graves shifted her focus between painting and sculpture throughout her career, intertwining her vast fascination with nature and science in both large-scale paintings and a variety of sculptural pieces. Other ways of her artistic expression include print-making and films. Although she worked in a wide range of both common and unconventional media, Graves’ body of work is unified by her interest in data and ways to translate scientific information into the unique visual statement. Another trait of Nancy Graves is that she had a reactionary stance toward both Minimalism and Pop Art, popular at that time.   Born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Nancy Graves’ early childhood years were filled with visits to the local Berkshire Museum where her father worked. While in a museum, she was surrounded by all kinds of influences, since Berkshire Museum houses natural science adjacent to a fine art. Growing up in such an environment, Nancy developed interests in art, nature, and anthropology. Graves got her education from Vassar College, graduating in English Literature. Her education continued at the prestige Yale University, where she studied alongside future painters, photographers, and sculptors – Janet Fish, Brice Marden, Chuck Close and Robert Mangold, just to name a few. While she was at Yale’s MFA program, Nancy met and fell in love with minimalist sculptor Richard Serra. The couple graduated in 1964 and married in Paris the following year, while Graves was on her Fulbright Scholarship.    Camels, Graves’ best-known pieces, caused a stir in the art world when they were first exhibited at the Graham Gallery in New York in 1968. These realistic life-size sculptures made to look like taxidermy defined her personal aesthetic and became a sort of a trademark at the beginning of her career. Seen as realistic illusions of nature, this project was so unusual at the time, so untypical and different from the clean cool Minimalist art of the 1960s. Critics and viewers were confused by the use of non-traditional materials and techniques. And more importantly, they stood out from the pile of minimalist and pop art as a stark contrast. The idea behind these sculptural works came from Nancy Graves’ childhood memories of the animals preserved by taxidermists in the Berkshire Museum. She managed to produce hyperrealistic sculptural effects by using different materials, among then burlap, wax, fiberglass, animal skin, wood, metal, and polyurethane. In order to appear even more realistic, each camel is painted with acrylics and oil colors. During the period of five years, Nancy produced 25 camels, no more than five of which are extant. And with each new sculpture, her replication skills became increasingly better. In 1969, Camel VI, Camel VII and Camel VIII were a part of Graves’ noted solo exhibition. She was the youngest person, and only the fifth woman, to be given the honor to have a solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. These works were also important because they indicated Graves’ approach to art in years that followed – the interplay between the replication of nature and the formal values of abstract art.   Graves’ long-standing fascination with camels has been exemplified in yet another work of art. Created in 1970, Variability of Similar Forms consists of thirty-six replicas of camel leg bones which she produced using several unconventional materials, such as Fiberglas, latex and marble dust. By placing all of the leg bones in various upright positions and arranging them in an irregular pattern, Graves created an illusion of an archaeological site yet to be discovered. As the title suggests, Nancy plays with the variability of forms, creating new connections between art and nature. Living in an era marked by early space exploration and scientific advances, Nancy was exposed to some images that could be seen for the first time in human history. Already a science-lover, the author was impressed and captivated by the satellite images of the moon, earth, and ocean floor. These new scientific discoveries became an integral part of Graves’ artistic practice. Her admiration of the natural world resulted in large-scale expressive compositions, ranging from pointillist-like Camouflage Series to map-like canvases based on satellite images of the ocean floor and surface of the moon. Brilliantly layered and painted in luminous colors, her aerial landscapes possess great abstract quality.   Throughout the 1980s, Graves dedicated herself to yet another medium – bronze casting. She used a variety of found objects, both organic and man-made, which she assembled and welded together. If you look closely, you can discover objects like leaves, spirals, architectural elements and all sorts of mechanical parts welded onto supporting scrap metal. Poetic, whimsical and personal, Graves’ bronze cast sculptures come in all sorts of shapes and colors. She used patination – a chemical process that fuses pigments of bronze – to color her sculptures. The color palette used in these artworks is intense and vivid, ranging from hot orange to sea green, resembling a fauna of a tropical reef. With its unusual shapes and hues, it almost looks like her pieces could belong to a coral reef.   When it comes to films, Nancy Graves stays true to her conceptual principles of naturalism. She produced five films in total – 200 Stills at 60 Frames, Goulimine, Izy Boukir, Aves: Magnificent Frigate Bird, Great Flamingo, and Reflections on the Moon – all shot during the early 1970s. Two of the films share a similar theme. Filmed in Morocco, Goulimine and Izy Boukir both capture the movement of animals through the magnificent Saharan landscape, whether as a flock or an individual camel separated from the group. Similar to Eadweard Muybridge’s motion study photography, Graves skillfully captures the subtle formations in close-framed sequences. She allows her subjects – in this case, camels – to determine the structure of a particular frame by their natural motions, shifting of their legs, or the curves of their extended necks.   Nancy was diagnosed with cancer in May 1995, and she lost her battle for life just a few months later. She died on October 21st, aged 55. Since her initial burst onto the international scene in 1969 with a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Nancy Graves was featured in numerous prominent solo and collective exhibitions around the world. During the 1970s, she was a part of renowned Documenta 5 and Documenta 6. Inclusion in these exhibitions serves as an example of her great importance. Although she never quite became an author whose name is often mentioned when speaking about the art of the 70s and 80s (decades marked mostly by Pop Art), Nancy Graves’ avant-garde approach is worshiped by the ones who were curious enough to discover her work.  She is represented by Puccio Fine Art, located in New York. ",1092

Mathew Hale,"For British artist, Mathew Hale art is about making things awkward and foreign.[1] His work consists of dismembered images, mind-bending hybrids and impossible juxtapositions that can satisfy the most unusual desire. The UK-born Berlin-based artist employs book pages, graphic structures, and ink figures to create an array of visual structures including provocative collages of varying dimensions, wall installations, and videos. His body of work encompasses different layers of reality that question the historical construction as well as modern societal structures.[2]  Mathew Hale was born in 1962. He attended Winchester School of Art and Goldsmiths, University of London before moving to Berlin in the year of 2000. The artist starts his creative process by sitting at a table with a clear mind trying to come up with something fresh. He uses paper clippings and advertising to create unusual juxtapositions that represent a flammable mixture that never fails to blow the mind of the people who view it. Deeply rooted in the tradition of Dadaist collage, political photomontage and the art of surrealism, the subject matter of Mathew Hale's work is versatile but never easy, as he tackles the topics of politics, philosophy, history, sex, religion and popular culture. In the style of true surrealists, Mathew Hale uses mixed media collages to highlight unconscious desires or repressed historical traumas. The press photos of the suicide of the wife of German chancellor Helmut Kohl and tragically deceased princess Diana are strangely juxtaposed with nudity and the inevitable swastika.[3]   In his mixed media pieces, the artist employs an array of characters from the field of politic, popular culture and members of British royal family but also invent an array of characters of his own. Miriam is a character that stayed with the artist for years as he created a whole series of collages dealing with her imaginary life. Miriam series began in 2000 and has continued till today. The series juxtaposes the cut-out symbols of maternity with erotic and at times pornographic images. The topic of birth itself is connected with the creation of the colleges that allow found objects to start a new life and experience a unique type of re-birth.   Though his most famous for his collages Mathew Hale is a multimedia artist whose works spans to a variety of genres. His photographs reveal the birth of his art by featuring images of collages in the process of their making including the materials used such as rolls of tape, magazines or notes. One of Mathew Hale's most recognizable video works DIE MUNZE (the Coin) is done in collaboration with Astrid Proll a former member of Red Army Faction. The video that represents an image of the modern money-obsessed world also tackles the issue of new economy of digital images and the uncertain place of painting and photography within it.

Lino Tagliapietra,"Lino Tagliapietra is an Italian artist from the city of Murano. He is a glassmaker and glass artist who makes wonderful creations inspired by travel and adventure. The city of Murano is famous for its wonderful glass objects and skillful craftsmen who make the worldwide known glass sculptures, household items, and home decor. He works as an artist, but also as a teacher, mentor, and guide to many young, aspiring or even experienced glassblowers. He played a big part in exchanging the Murano technique and general knowledge of glassblowing all over the world.  Lino Tagliapietra was born in 1934, and he started practicing glassblowing when he was only 12 years old. Being surrounded by craftsmen and industrial workers, helped him to get many jobs and to experience firsthand how it's like to work with tool and machines. His first jobs in factories and studios were menial and insignificant, but the original work he witnessed had a major role in his practical education. Lacking a formal training in art did not stop him to learn everything he could about modern Italian art. He often visited Murano Glass Museum and attended the Venice Biennales.   His first works were simple objects. Then came the more advanced reproductions. At the age of 25, he was already a Maestro a master glass blower. He is a true master in making what he imagines. He creates the idea himself, and develops it independently, too. Glass is a medium that transfers all of Tagliapietra's experiences and activities. He names his collections by the many places he visited. Most of his blown glass sculptures are made in series, and they are entitled by the traveling adventures Tagliapietra had: Maui, Bilbao, Seattle Sunset. There are also ones named after common shapes they resemble, such as Female body, Dinosaur or Angel tear.   In 2012 he made a huge piece of 35 glass boats hanging from the ceiling that was featured in Columbus Museum of Arts, Ohio and held in a permanent collection. The combination of specific technique and the idea to create art in glass form made Lino Tagliapietra one of the most skillful and influential glass blower artist in the world. His specific sensibility and love for the Venetian glass helped him to achieve both aesthetic perfection and the quality of technical production. He uses traditional methods of glass bowling in combination with contemporary practices of carving, layering, and casing. Another fascinating feature is his colors, which he makes himself, keeping the palette classically Venetian, soft, gentle, and above all - beautiful.  ",1097

A.Selvaraj,"It takes a special kind of talent to be able to show the feelings of calm and tranquility through something that an epitome of movement – the dance. A.Selvaraj, one of India’s most famous and appreciated artists, does just that, managing to make his viewers feel serene even though they are exposed to something that seemingly evokes the exact opposite. All of his artistic talent is focused there and that is the main reason for his popularity. However, at one point, his life was nowhere near artistic future, as the career in engineering was in his focus. The destiny, universe, whatever you may call it, interfered, allowing him to realize that his love of classical Indian dance could be projected through visual arts. Having discovered this new world where he could express himself through painting, Selvaraj quietly forwent his studies and the possibility of a career as an engineer, and bravely embraced his passion, beginning to further discover his true love – the painting and drawing. When he was only 23, in 1966, the artist became a life member of the internationally recognized and critically acclaimed Cholamandal Artists’ Village located in Chennai.  Influenced by the sensuousness of dance, Selvaraj creates his pieces that seemingly flow onto the canvas like a fluid stretch of moving water, spilling into a giant waterfall that celebrates color, dance, and life itself. In 2006, the artist created a series of artworks titled Enchantress, summarizing in a way all of his previous efforts. His high school was located in Gudiyattam, a suburb of Chennai, and he studied at the Government School of Arts and Crafts, where he received his Diploma in Fine Arts in 1960. Three years later, as stated above, he became a life member of the Cholamandal Artists’ Village. Selvaraj states, reflecting his life and artistic journey from Gudiyattam High School to Cholamandal Artists’ Village, that his personal experiences with dance slowly began to affect his style in both sculpture and painting. The pieces acquired fluidity, and he is particularly able to get the flow of light and dark in his paintings. Inspired by deities, village women, dancers and musicians, Selvaraj keeps his style clearly figurative. ",1099
Manfred Pernice,"A German installation artist, Manfred Pernice uses shipping containers and packaging to create site-specific sculptures and spatial interventions. His constructions sometimes incorporate recognizable forms like a house or a bookcase. Born in 1963 in Hildesheim, Germany, Pernice currently lives and works in Berlin. He studied at the Institut für Bildende Kunst in Braunschweig from 1984 to 1987 and at the Universität der Künste in Berlin from 1988 to 1993. He exhibited worldwide, including venues such as Musee d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris, Portikus in Frankfurt, Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin, Sprengel Museum Hanover, Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, The Modern Institute in Glasgow and Neues Museum in Nuremberg.

He taught at Akademie Der Bildenden Künste Vienna, Vienna, Austria from 2004 and 2009, and since 2012, he has been teaching at Universität der Künste, Berlin. While Pernice's constructions often incorporate recognizable forms, they are imbued with a sense of the absurd and the ambiguous. Each of his containers work as a metaphor, since they are not meant to be used but are rather abstractions of the ""strange situation of containers"", as he explains it. His work often comments on the segmentation and “canning” of space. ",1100
Remy Zaugg,"A Swiss painter, Remy Zaugg is primarily known as a conceptual artist. He played an important role as both a critic and observer of contemporary culture, especially with regards to the perception of space and architecture.

Zaugg died in 2005 in Basel. Concerning himself with seeing and blindness, Zaugg created works that are difficult to behold. Among his most famous works are flat typographical paintings, featuring short phrases in various languages, juxtaposing harshly clashing fluorescent colors that strain the eyes. These works also reflected his concerns with exploring language and perception as a medium for activating the spectator. ",1101

Lee Bae,"Lee Bae is a Korean contemporary artist, widely known and appreciated for his paintings. The color black constitutes the very center of his art.

The artist created a distinct pictorial and abstract universe - a formal and immersive journey into the abysses of blackness. Concentrating on the evocative power of the material, he creates an essential equilibrium between charcoal’s profound black for his abstract forms, and the milky white color obtained thanks to resin and the successive layers of acrylic paint. His works demonstrates the real nature of abstract forms, their essence, offering to the painting a zone of energy, purity and spirituality. ",1103
Paul Wunderlich,"Paul Wunderlich was a painter, sculptor and graphic artist active between 1927 and 2010. The artist was influenced by Emil Nolde, Oskar Kokoschka, and Salvador Dali.

Jose Lerma,"Through his artistic practice the Spanish born American artist José Lerma is exploring the domains of painting primarily in regards to the historical representation and autobiographical elements. By appropriating found materials the artist is extending or rather translating the painterly process to elaborate spatial installations, and produces artworks saturated with different layers coming from history and personal mythology. Lerma incorporates research and an innovative treatment of inherited painterly patterns especially when it comes to portraiture. The artist smoothly composes each artwork by delivering depictions that are at the same time reminiscent of expressionist gestures and collages. In doing so, Lerma constructs visually intriguing imagery that deconstructs contemporary desire for a beautiful painting. Lerma earned his BA in 1994 at Tulane University in New Orleans, and from 2001 to 2002 he received his MA and MFA in Painting University of Wisconsin-Madison. ",1107
Celia Hempton,"The paintings of Celia Hempton are graphic and sensual explorations of flesh. The artist investigates situation and paints works from an interesting position, exploring her responsive emotions which range from ‘fascination to rage and hilarity’. It is the confidently distinct way in which her work extends beyond its overt sexual inflection, which she describes as incidental, that defines Hempton as a painter. ",1108

Arthur Luiz Piza,"Arthur Luiz Piza is a Brazilian artist known as one of the most compelling representatives of the art of engraving. Born in San Paulo, Brazil in 1928, Luiz Piza began his studies in art at a very young age as a student of Antonio Gomide, who taught him painting and the art of frescoes. In 1951, he settled in Paris. Living in post-war Montparnasse, Piza regularly attended Johnny Friedlaender’s engraving workshop, developing his techniques in copper engraving, etching and intaglio. While living in France, he participated in a large number of group exhibitions, including San Paulo Biennale, the Biennale of Ljubljana, the Grenchen Print Biennale, Kassel Documenta, and Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, and was the recipient of numerous first prizes. He also presented his work in solo exhibitions in Brazil and France; in the Galerie La Hune (Paris). Since 1958, the artist devoted himself primarily to burin engraving, creating reliefs and collages, as well as sculpted objects, porcelain and jewellery. He developed a very unique process, where the plate is cut, gashed, gouged, hammered, sculpted in small, successive marks that, like scales, interlock and overlap and hollows become volumes. The process of producing each impression was a time consuming and laborious process of collaboration between Piza and his printers.",1110

John Little,"John Little was an American artist whose early style had a linear quality inspired by Surrealist automatism, but his later works featured thick impasto and gestural brushstrokes. Born in 1907 in Alabama, Little attended the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy as a teenager from 1924 to 1927. Soon after, he moved to New York, where he began operatic vocal training and ran a very successful textile business designing fabric and wallpaper. In 1933, he began classes at the Art Students League with George Grosz, painting mainly Cezannesque landscapes. After studying with Hans Hofmann, through whom he also became a close friend with Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock, he began to explore abstraction. His canvases of the late 1940s reveal great experimentation and a growing interest in both Surrealist automatism, Picasso, and the theories of Hans Hofmann. Discussing his work, he explained he was trying to get away from the drawing, ""letting form and color carry the idea rather than the line."" From the early 1950s, he began using thick, gestural buildup of paint in his works. In 1957, he co-founded the Signa Gallery, an important outpost in East Hampton for the growing New York art scene that hosted many influential exhibitions.

Heath Kane,"Heath Kane is a UK-based, Australian contemporary artist. His work is known for evoking a dialogue that encourages social change. Heath's collections center around narratives that are subversive, as well as politically and socially motivated. Heath is synonymous with creating bold, striking, often lurid art. His approach to art has always been driven by the practice of design thinking: combining his commercial art experience with the origins of pop art. He focuses on creating simple, iconic and memorable pieces. Heath has collaborated with Wired Magazine, Saatchi Art and Adidas and has recently worked with Penguin Books to make the last published covers of George Orwell's most famous books. Heath shows his work in galleries and solo shows both in the UK and worldwide. ""I have always been fascinated by the world around me: particularly where life, art and storytelling collide.

Miha Strukelj,"A visual artist from Ljubljana, Slovenia, Miha Strukelj works in painting, drawing, and site-specific work. Drawn to ambiguous nature and the confines of a space, he creates urban landscapes that have a new sense of place by combining different real or fictitious elements, or by abstracting real topologies. Urban spaces are defined by architecture, landmarks and points, which creates tension, while, in between, there are empty and forgotten spaces. Strukelj focuses on these in-between spaces with no content, exploring how we define and perceive reality and how architecture and environment shape us. By leaving empty patches in his works, the artist challenges the viewers' perception of these genres. This exploration has led him to investigate how painting and drawing function in physical space, attempting to bring them into space by constructing large-scale installations. Strukelj is a graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts Ljubljana, Slovenia in 2001 with a Master of Fine Arts. He has won several awards, including the Pollock-Krasner Grant 2008/09 and the Henkel Drawing Award 2008. His work has also been included in the National Collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana. In 2009, he was the sole artist to present his work in the Slovenian Pavilion at 53rd Venice Biennial. ",1115
Jens Fange,"A Swedish visual artist, Jens Fänge works at the intersection of the early-twentieth-century practice of collage and the ancient art of shadow play. He is best known for a surrealistic matryoshka-like aesthetic, which consists of assembling paintings within paintings. Born in 1965 in Gothenburg, Sweden, Fänge lives and works in Stockholm. He graduated from The Valand Academy of Fine Arts, Gothenburg, Sweden and Hovedskous School of Painting, Gothenburg, Sweden.

The composite works of Jens Fänge encompasses an entire hierarchy of genres, combining iconic portraits, still lifes, domestic interiors, cityscapes, and landscapes with geometric abstractions, all rendered with a variety of media and materials, including oil paint, pencil, vinyl, cardboard, and fabric on panel. Comprised of multiple overlapping stage-like layers of representations, these works present an endless maze of shifting perspectives, not only within each composition but also within each series as a whole. His works possess a certain dynamism, whether through flat, patterned fields or perspectives that challenge the eye. ",1116
Zach Harris,"A contemporary American artist, Zach Harris is best known for his carved panel paintings that combine mystical imagery, illusionistic patterning, and intricate figuration. These works both honor and obscure the art histories that they draw from. Born in 1976 in Santa Rosa, California, USA, Harris currently lives and works in Los Angeles, California. He earned his BA from Bard College, Red Hook, NY and his MFA from Hunter College, New York, NY. His works was on view at venues such as Perrotin, New York, Seoul, and Paris, David Kordansky Gallery, Los Angeles, Feuer/Mesler Gallery, New York, Elizabeth Leach Gallery, Portland, Belfast, ME and Leo Xu Projects, Shanghai. The psychedelic visions of Zach Harris immerse viewers in the unfathomable depths of mysterious cosmologies, suggesting timeless rituals, which have yet to be deciphered. His paintings are characterized by the use of repetition and internal frames and the color palette of subdued browns and deep ochres. These works evoke a range of influences from folk art to a diversity of Eastern and Western art-historical traditions, including the highly demanding ornamental quality of Persian miniatures, the elaborate woodwork of Christian altarpieces or the radial vibrancy and spiritual dimension of Tibetan mandalas. “Within a single small shape one can detect worlds within worlds where logic fields resolve and contrast endlessly with one another,” the artist explained.

Matthew Benedict,"An American contemporary artist, Matthew Benedict has developed a new visual language that confronts visual traditions from both high and low culture. Following the tradition of classical history painting, he creates large size and narrative allusions in which all the elements are an analogy, referring to something beyond themselves.

Always site-specific, Aranda's installations and temporary projects often explore social interactions and the role that the circulation of objects plays in the cycles of production and consumption. Challenging the boundaries between subject and object while embracing chance encounters, auto-destruction and social processes, her work examines the potential of science-fiction, alternative economies and the ""poetics of circulation.""

Miru Kim,"An artist, photographer, illustrator, and arts events coordinator, Miru Kim explores various urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations, tunnels, sewers, catacombs, factories, hospitals, and shipyards. Kim’s Naked City Spleen is her best-known body of work, where she photographed herself in these spaces, nude. The artist was featured in several international publications, such as Best and Brightest issue in 2007 for the Esquire and an article in The Financial Times of London titled We’ll climb that bridge when we get to it. Her artwork is part of numerous public collections around the world, including The Francis J Greenburger Collection, National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art Korea, Addison Gallery of American Art, Seoul Museum of Art, Borusan Contemporary Turkey, The Museum of Photography Seoul, and Leeum Samsung Museum of Art.   Miru Kim was born in 1981 in Stoneham, Massachusetts, and is the daughter of renowned Korean public philosopher Do-ol. In 1995 she returned to the US and enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover in Massachusetts. The artist relocated to New York City in 1999 and attended Columbia University, from which she graduated with a bachelor's degree in French and Romance Philology. She graduated in 2006 with M.F.A in painting from Pratt Institute in New York. She also runs a nonprofit called Naked City Arts to promote Manhattan’s young local artists. Kim spent her 20s exploring with her older sister SeungJung abandoned tunnels and buildings around New York City. During this time, thanks to her obsession with rats, the artist developed an appreciation for dark intimate atmospheres of tunnels which she saw as the subconscious of the city itself.   In Kim’s Naked City Spleen series, she continues to explore the abandoned places, this time completely naked. In these photographs of the highest rooftops and deepest caverns and sewer tunnels, the artist’s naked body became a stark counterpoint to all the ruins and decay around her. In the photographs of the pig farm in The Pig That Therefore I Am series, at the first glance it is impossible to discern one naked human among all the animals. Here Kim has immersed herself amongst the pigs, naked flesh almost invisible, yet completely isolated. In 2012 Miru Kim moved to the desert and lived for a time with a Bedouin family.

Vibrant and kinetic, Adams' works are inspired by textile design, architecture and postmodern poetry. Before working with color, Adams uses charcoal to sketch her pieces, getting a sense of scale, line and shape on the canvas. As she explained, this process frees her, providing her with a space to get involved with before she begins applying the color. ",1146
Jo Hummel,"Jo Hummel is a British contemporary abstract artist who employs spontaneous variations of space, color, and form onto painted and paper collaged surfaces. These works blend formal investigations of color, form, and surface with humanist concerns about the phenomenological function of materials and process. Often experimenting, she lets the process determine the outcome, providing a safe arena for improvisation and a place where intuition can co-exist and thrive alongside rational procedures. Careful planning, pure instinct, and chance – all equally important. Working on the floor, Hummel constructs her collages out of forms and shapes she pre-cuts from painted sheets of watercolor paper. By painting each side of the paper in different colors and textures, she gives herself options. She is always willing to undo an action, allowing her works to be in a state of flux until final decisions are made, describing her working process as being similar to editing. Hummel lives and works on the Isle of Wight. Featured image: Jo Hummel - Land, 2019 (detail). Acrylic and emulsion on watercolor paper and ply. 35 2/5 × 35 2/5 × 4/5 in. 90 × 90 × 2 cm.

Carlos Gamez de Francisco,"Carlos Gamez de Francisco is a Cuban-American contemporary painter and fine art photographer based in Prospect, KY. Born in post-revolutionary Cuba, he was educated in an academic style heavily influenced by the Russian Academy, with this frame of reference being evident in all of his work. Exposed to the influence of the figurative arts by the presence of the Russian Academy, he accepted it as a dogma, as well as the censorship of contemporary art and the limited access to information. Having understood that de-contextualizing epochs and artistic symbols is the tool he could use to establish a connection between the present and the past, de Francisco started creating works that provide an escape from reality and create an illusory world. “I am more interested in altering history than depicting it accurately.”   ",1148

By condensing movements, lights, and colors on a canvas, he builds a personal link between abstraction and stylistic academia painting. Esposito uses plasticine, which gives him complete freedom over the final image. Closely linked to his state of mind, his creative process attempts to bring to the surface a positive and constructive approach to internal chaos, to the absence of security.

Many of his pieces were created while working as a translator over the phone, which allows his words to flow together with the physical act of painting.

Pablo Griss,"Pablo Griss is a Venezuelan artist who explores the visual possibilities of energy and its qualities: magnetic fields, radiation, resonance, currents, and electromagnetic waves. He’s been interested in these phenomena since his Engineering and Applied Sciences studies at Columbia University. Not aiming to “illustrate them in painting or explain them as physical processes or diagrammatic interpretation, an equation”, Griss wants to see how “these physical phenomena connect with some of my inner existential musings”. Recognizing his obsession with the negative space, the artist utilizes it to broaden the multidimensional possibilities in his work. Focused on the values that can be communicated and transcended poetically through painting, his pieces have a strong presence that does not offer any literal or conceptual narrative. Going much more profound than the two-dimensional surface they’re created on, the works can take its observers “to other non-ordinary planes outside known reality. This is where a painting shows its most significant value: when it transforms from within.” After completing his studies of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Pablo Griss enrolled at the School of Visual Arts, Colombia University, receiving his B.A. in 1996.

Ronnie Cutrone,"An American pop artist Ronnie Cutrone is renowned for creating colorful paintings of some of the most famous cartoon characters like Peter Rabbit and Pink Panther. He was a part of the New York Avant-garde scene in the late 60s, and he worked closely with Andy Warhol at the Factory, where he perfected his style. Cutrone's artworks are among collections of famous museums such as the Museum of Contemporary Art of Los Angeles, Whitney Museum in New York, Museum of Modern Art of New York, and Brooklyn Museum of Arts in New York.   Born in 1948 in New Your City, Cutrone is part of the generation of artists that received their visual education through mainstream media. Through television, he came in contact with commercials, Hollywood icons, and rock'n'roll, and they formed his unique artistic expression. After graduating from the School of Visual Art in New York, where he painted images of survival and rescue, Cutrone met Andy Warhol in 1972 and became his assistant for ten years. They worked closely in Warhol’s Factory studio, creating prints, paintings, and concepts from 1972 until 1980. These are considered to be Warhol’s most rich and productive years, and they greatly influenced Cutrone in refining his unique style, which the critiques named Post-pop. In 1980 Jay Shriver took his position in Fabric so that the artist could concentrate more on paintings. In 1982 Cultrone emerged with his first canvasses depicting cartoon characters.   Cutrone was a close observer of human nature. His work is a humorous and satirical commentary on the political and social implications of American society. The cartoon characters are tools for drawing attention to problems that should not be overlooked. Often painted on the American flag, they are as much part of their habitats as humans are. The artworks are a direct testament to the artist's identity and research. Cutrone said: Besides paintings, the artist also created drawings and sculptures. Among his early works was a series of iron cages titled The Getting to Know You Cage exhibited at the Mudd Club, which he run for three years until 1982. Also, as part of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable show, he danced with Velvet Underground with Mary Woronov and Gerard Malanga.   Ronnie Cutrone had a distingue affection for fluorescent and bright colors, and his skillful use of them has influenced the change in Andy Warhol’s artistic style. Cutrone has always been sensitive to political and historical happenings in his home country. One of his most notable works was a direct response to the events of September 11th, which also marked a change in his artistic expression. The artist’s last solo exhibition was in 2003 at Lorenzelli Arte in Milano. Ronnie Cutrone worked in New York until his death in 2013.   ",1189
Jennifer Chalklen,"Mostly self-taught, Jennifer Chalklen is a contemporary realist painter from New Zealand, currently residing in Singapore with her family. Once at the forefront of digital marketing, working for clients such as Ski Himalaya, Huffer, Solomon, Rip Curl, PlayStation, and Billabong, Chalklen decided that it was time to put time into her own ideas instead of others’. The timing coincided with the family moving to Indonesia. With two small children and third on the way, and lacking technical skills, the “simple” task of conveying ideas proved quite difficult.  A couple of art teachers and experiences (that would make most people quit) later, Chalklen realized she had to do it herself. Google, YouTube videos, and trial and error resulted in a unique visual language. Having problems with authority and someone telling her what to do, the fact she is mostly self-taught gave the artist a kind of self-governance over her artistic direction. Now her practice is a gentle contemplation presented in a visual form, resulting in a series of paintings strongly representational in form, and yet somehow otherworldly in design.  Chalklen wrote in her blog in 2017:  ",1190
George McNeil,"A prolific artist and member of the New York Abstract Expressionists, George McNeil created works that ranged from entirely abstract to loosely representational. Throughout his career, he commanded a mastery technique, capable of creating paintings of rich texture depth and color. Born in Queens, New York in 1908, McNeil attended the Pratt Institute, which he left before gaining his degree. He then copied works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and attended classes at the Art Students League, where he studied with Jan Matulka in 1931–32. From 1932 to 1936 he studied with Hans Hofmann, becoming Hofmann's monitor (assistant) and teaching a class in collage. In 1936 he became one of the founding members of the American Abstract Artists group, becoming one of the few abstract artists whose work was selected for the New York World's Fair in 1939. McNeil's work evolved from early cubist-influenced compositions to full abstraction. In the early 1960s, he introduced figuration into his works, particularly in the Dancer and Bather series. He once explained: ""I'm not a figure painter at all. I'm an abstract painter where I hope that bringing in the figure brings in certain human or psychological connotations or associations."" His works from the 1980s were inspired by dynamic situations such as discos, New York City, football, street life or graffiti, reflecting in profound attention to color and complex abstract volumes.

Maria Taniguchi,"A contemporary artist from the Philippines, Maria Taniguchi is best known for her ongoing series of ""brick paintings"" made of repetitive patterns of grey-black rectangles. Created in a systematic manner, these deliberate, cerebral paintings function as renderings of the artist’s moods, digital algorithms or equations. Born in 1981 in Dumaguete City, Philippines, Maria Taniguchi lives and works in Manila. She earned a BFA in Sculpture from The University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts, and an MFA in Art Practice, at the Goldsmiths University of London, as well as LUX Associate Artists Programme, London. Her work has been exhibited in various exhibitions all around the world, including Berlin, Shanghai, Los Angeles, Tokyo and London. Created through a labour-intensive process, her paintings are first drawn on grid, then filled one ""brick"" at a time over a period of months. Differing in size, these works carrie the same content, while each being slightly unique in its distributions of minor gradations within the grid due to varied ratios of water and acrylic. Seeking to transform canvas into something more durable, Taniguchi aims to call into question notions of surface by constructing painted architectures, rather than images. Rather than calling the paintings meditative, she considers them more of a record of passing time and a means of regulating her own production. ",1192
Chung Chang-Sup,"The Korean artist Chung Chang-Sup was a prominent figure of the Dansaekhwa monochrome movement, a synthesis of traditional Korean spirit and Western abstraction, which emerged in the early 1970s. His work reflects his Taoist belief that the artist must balance material and nature in the unified act of making in order to reach harmony. Born in 1927 in Cheongiu, South Korea, Chang-Sup graduated from Cheongju School of Education, Cheongju, Korea and College of Fine Arts, Seoul National University, Seoul. His works were exhibited all around the world, including Axel Vervoordt Gallery, Antwerp, Kukje Gallery, Seoul, Galerie Perrotin, Hong Kong, New York and Paris, National Museum of Contemporary Art, Korea, Gwacheon, Korea, Tokyo Gallery, Tokyo, Japan, and Mark Moore Gallery, Los Angeles, USA. Chang-Sup is known for his highly personal technique of using Korean tak fibre, made of the inner bark of paper mulberry, a tree and plant species native to Asia. The mulberry fibre is soaked, rubbed, and dissolved into pulp, after which the artist would scoop it up, spread it on a canvas, tap and knead it. This is where the artist would surrender control and await the material's spontaneous response. He also used other natural pigments, mostly out of tobacco leaves and charcoal, yet subtly faded and blurred into the yellowish tint from paper mulberry sap. ",1193
Franklin Evans,"An American contemporary artist, Franklin Evans creates immersive works constructed from amassed art supplies and materials found in his studio space such as artists’ tape, bubble wrap, old newsprint, unstretched canvas, and press releases from gallery exhibitions.

He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University in 1989 and his Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Iowa in 1993.

In his work, Evans uses paint to create hyper-realistic, illusionistic effects of layering and wear, while exploring the process of making art. He also encourages viewers to walk all over his floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall installations and further engage with them. ",1194
Harald F. Muller,"A German contemporary artist, Harald F. Müller mixes materials that include photography, painting and sculpture. His work is the result of extensive research in archives and libraries, making use of a few significant pictures which are unchanged but decontextualized to make them ambiguous. Born in 1950 in Karlsruhe, Germany, Müller currently lives and works in Höri peninsula, Lake Constance, Germany. He graduated from Stuttgart Art Academy, Germany. He has exhibited at venues including Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany, Centre de la Photographie, Geneve,Switzerland, Kunstverein Baselland, Switzerland, Musée d’Art moderne et contemporain, Geneva, Villa Arson, Nice, Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe, among others. Enlarging his found images to as much as four meters, the artist prints them on conventional Cibachrome paper mounted on thin panels of aluminum and hangs them on sculptural mounts so that they appear to be floating. When viewed up close, these works allow for different levels of perception, from the objective to the abstract. Through this practice, he explores the emotional resonance of advertising imagery when released from its function.

Exploring the theme of femininity, the series challenges traditional beliefs about women in Chinese society. “Youth” represents Yang’s most intimate project yet. She focuses on a younger generation in China - a generation that is different from her own. They are very self-conscious of their appearance, have tattoos, hair with different colors, and flamboyant looks.

Kenneth Blom,"Blending architectural and figurative elements, Kenneth Blom is a Norwegian artist known for depicting solitary figures in industrial and empty landscapes. These landscapes are rendered in broad brushstrokes, often expressing moods and states of mind. Approaching his compositions with the attitude of a stage director, Blom’s characters (actors) personify the theater of reality on the scene (engineered background). He skillfully mixes diagonal lines with horizontal fugues and minimalistic geometric design, “reminding of the tautness and charm typical of the buildings at the time of the birth of modern architecture.” Under an emphasized sense of theatricality is a psychological substratum. The depicted characters and their state of mind are reflected in their actions, whether staying put, falling, jumping, or running. All of these actions are “indisputable archetypes of the human psychological condition, and existential obsessions.” The artist studied at the Oslo Academy of Art (1990-1994) and Düsseldorf Art Academy (1994-1995).

Colin Fleck,"Colin Fleck is an American contemporary artist whose work results from meditations on the human species’ collective identity crisis - a “crisis traced to a collective existential loneliness.” Asking questions that originate from this existential perspective, he aims to utilize the most basic level of communication: symbols and their meanings. Having recognized the existence of “certain constant symbols denoting nearly universally agreed-upon meaning,” Fleck is interested in appropriating these “unquestioned” symbols, hoping to use their immediacy and effectiveness to connect with broader audiences. “Using familiarity and mythology as vehicles for my allegories, I construct artworks with the intention of creating a common ground where meaning may once again take root and grow.” However, his works are also filled with less obvious, more nuanced symbols, objects that hold a special place in his life, creating narrative-driven paintings that ask the viewers to imagine the actions, characters, and objects that fill the scenes before and after they arrive in front of the paintings. The artist received a BA in Philosophy from Rhodes College in Memphis, TN, in 2012, a BFA from Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, CA, with a degree in Illustration in 2016, and an MFA in Studio Art from SAIC in Chicago, IL, in 2020.

Matthew F Fisher,"Visualizing the infinity of time and space, Matthew F Fisher is an American artist who portrays scenes of nature that appear suspended in time. Born in Boston, he spent a large portion of his youth at his grandfather’s beach house in West Hampton, constantly surrounded by the breeze of the Atlantic Ocean and the soundtrack of the surf. His fascination with the ocean and waves originates in these memories and has laid the foundations for his work as an artist. Using recurring motifs such as seagulls, crustaceans, and the rising and setting sun, Fisher rearranges these symbols in each painting, creating new narratives and compositions. The artist slowly and intentionally layers acrylic and ink onto the canvas, rendering objects with such dimension and volume that they appear sculptural against flat, gradient backgrounds. The meditative process through which he works is reflected in the calmness of his paintings. Matthew F Fisher lives and works in New York City. ",1265

Jon Burgerman,"Jon Burgerman is a British artist who traverse the disciplines of contemporary art, design, illustration and entrepreneurship. He gives lectures, public performances and occasionally pop concerts with his band Anxieteam.  He was born in England and has studied art foundation in Bournville, Birmingham. He graduated in Fine Art from Nottingham Trent University in 2001, with First Class Honors. This artist is instigating improvisation and plays through drawing and spectacle. He is a purveyor of doodles and is often credited and referenced as the leading figure in the popular 'Doodle' art style. His work is placed between fine art, urban art and pop-culture, using humor to reference and question his contemporary milieu. His is a pervasive and instantly recognizable aesthetic that exists across a multitude of forms including canvases, large scale murals (indoor and outside), sculpture, toys, apparel, design, print and people (as tattoos and temporary drawings).  In 2008 his 300 page monograph entitled 'Pens Are My Friends' was published by IdN, collating the first 7 years of his professional career. In the same year Jon appeared on the seminal BBC TV show Blue Peter to create a mural 'doodle' live on set. Following the publication of his monograph Jon felt it was time, in late 2010, for the second phase of his career. He decided to give away most of his belongings and relocate from the middle of England to New York. He has received a Cannes Lions Advertising award, two D&AD Silver award nominations.  Performance, intervention and actively engaging, often directly, with an audience has been prominent within the evolution of his practice. Burgerman created a pop-art band entitled Anxieteam, having never been in a band or wrote music or lyrics before. The band, during their 4 year duration, signed an independent record deal, released an album and singles, performed in America and across Europe, had a song featured on a Rolling Stone Magazine cover CD, and were played on the radio, including prime time BBC Radio 1. In 2013 Jon co-produced and provided the artwork for the award winning documentary film The Great Hip Hop Hoax (dir. Jeanie Finlay), which premiered at SXSW film festival, Austin, Texas. He has also appeared speaking about his work in the documentaries Off The Record, 2015 (dir. Laura Sans) and Made You Look, 2015 (dir. Anthony Peters). His works include a focus on what he calls 'quiet interventions', where subtle, often cheap, nonpermanent actions drastically (and sometimes comically) alter the reading of a signifier, object or situation. It's Burgerman's belief that through these playful, creative acts, Art can act as an agent to change the world, by being the catalysis to allow people to change their worlds. His is a pervasive and instantly recognizable aesthetic that exists across a multitude of forms including canvases, large scale murals (indoor and outside), sculpture, toys, apparel, design, print and people (as tattoos and temporary drawings).  Burgerman's work has been featured in many newspapers, magazines, books and blogs around the world. Some of these include: Al Jezerra America, BBC, The Guardian newspaper, Coolhunting, BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, The Daily Mail, New York Daily, Flavourwire, Gothamist, Metro UK, News.com.au, PSFK, The Telegraph Australia, Trendhunter, Yahoo.com, Dazed and Confused, Be Street magazine, The Financial Times, Wooster Collective, Vandalog, Reedit, Bored Panda, Art-Magazin, Juxtapoz, AI-AP, Eye, Creative Review, Design Week, Edge, The Star Malaysia, JoongAng Daily newspaper (Korea), Slam Hype, Format magazine.

Ron English," It is a long way from being a ghost painter to becoming an icon, whose work is widely recognizable and immensely popular. Ron English has experienced both extremes as he traveled down the same path that included working as an anonymous painter for other artists but also reaching the level of popularity and fame that is simply unbelievable. Sure, people today are a little bit loose when branding certain artists as icons and legends, but English is certainly one. His pieces are easily recognizable, inspiring to the others, and so influential that they actually made an impact on the 2008 American presidential elections.   The term POPaganda was coined to describe the artist’s constant mixing of the high and low art. He’s done pretty much everything when it comes to art – he is one of the founding fathers of street art and one of the forerunners of Pop Surrealism, he designs toys and sculptures, and he paints. One of his trademarks is the hijacking of advertising billboards and redoing them in the same style but with the characters of his own creation. The attention to details is very high and that is because of his past experiences as an art reproducer. When speaking of English’s inspirations, Picasso’s Guernica is at the top of the list, as well as the work of Keith Haring, Peter Saul, and Martin Wong. The approach of the American artist Gordon Matta-Clark, who placed a lot fewer restrictions on his process of creation, was also very influential for English.   The beginnings were frustrating for the artist when he worked as a ghost painter for other artists and was unaccredited. However, this type of work provided a lot of opportunities to improve the existing and learn new techniques. When he was younger, English began his now so characteristic hijacking of billboards, first in Texas, and he managed to re-do many of them before he was finally caught and charged with a 2nd-degree felony. Things have changed over the years, and even though the repainting billboards is still a felony, people now give him billboards, and he does them a favor by redoing them. The Dandy Warhols and Slash are some of the musicians English have done artworks for, and the level of fame reached new heights when he made an appearance on an episode of Simpsons, alongside Shepard Fairey, Robbie Conal, and Kenny Scharf.   What does it mean to be a street art legend? Is the secret simply in achieving fame and fortune, or is there more?  When your pieces become so wide-spread, so popular and influential so they actually have an impact on presidential elections in the USA, that’s when you are a legend. Ron English has conquered the world of art with his flawless techniques and endless inspiration. He is one of the Godfathers of billboard art, which he became interested in as the writing on the billboard seemed to possess a level of authority which was greater than those on the walls. So he started painting his messages over the ads, advertising the truth.  ",1272
Hush,"Creating a successful blend of old and new is always a risky business. And, if you add to it a surprising mixture of culture – the task is getting even harder. Apparently, that doesn’t apply to Hush, a British artist known for his mixed techniques of collage, graffiti, stencil, painting and drawing he uses to cover the streets and fill the galleries all around the world with his geisha inspired works. Japanese traditional female entertainers, depicted through their feminine beauty and sensuality, are created in traditional colors and modern graffiti style, synthesizes this artist’s affection for Street Art aesthetics and traditional art practices.    Born in Newcastle, England, trained as a graphic designer at the Newcastle School of Art and Design, Hush’s art practice has taken him around the globe throughout Asia, Europe, and the United States. His immersion in such a diverse range of cultures and environments is evident in his work and his captivating portrayal of the immortal beauty of the female form. Over the course of his travels, Hush developed a fascination with the mark-making, tagging, and graffiti he encountered along the way.    Hush presents contemporary depictions of traditional portrait and figurative imagery through an inventive mix of seemingly incompatible themes and aesthetics. His street and gallery work offsets graffiti flourishes in futuristic silvers and blacks with a colorful chaotic collage, inspired by layers of flyposting and other urban detritus. He places historical female figures into this sensual blizzard, emphasizing the transient nature of modern life in comparison to the timeless forces of passion and desire.  They are dehumanized – painted in gray with their eyes blanked out for instance – to accent their nature as avatars of female sexuality. Hush once said that some people think his women are serene, others that they’re scary – but, what is clear is the power of their sensuality. Hush's hyper-sexualised Babushkas, classical Sirens, and Japanese Geishas explore a whole new approach to a traditional feminine role.   Hush has participated in both solo and group exhibitions and shows worldwide, including galleries in Los Angeles, New York City, Miami, London, Basel, San Francisco and Berlin. His work has been featured in a series of publications including Street Knowledge (Harper Collins), The Street Art Stencil Book (Laurence King Publishing), Huck magazine, Art Monthly and The Independent newspaper, where he was recognized in their list of the Top 20 Up and Coming Artists. Through his technique of layering divergent aesthetics, Hush’s contemporary paintings disclose the beauty produced by years of decayed tagging and the possibility of creating something new. A formally trained artist, Hush's methods involve action painting and what he calls pure expressionism. The collage-effect backgrounds are screen printed and hand-painted, then the graffiti elements added by hand in the action painting style, sometimes over many months. Because, it takes time to create excellence. This artist is represented by Hang-Up Gallery from London, Kumi Contemporary, Lazarides in London, and The Outsiders Gallery.

L'Atlas,"L'Atlas is a French artist whose work is all about lines and forms. The main theme of his paintings, graffiti, and installations is the displacement of the people around the world. The spirit of his art can be compared to limitlessness, where borders and frontiers are described as mental barriers. Having the roots in street art, he gradually got familiar with diverse types of calligraphy and geometry that have overtaken the primal aspect of his art, but he still knows to ‘attack’ street walls once in a while. L’Atlas uses different mediums like canvas, video, spray paint, sticky tape in his mission of creating universal language and signs that can be understood by everyone. Since his childhood, the artist has been attracted by the energy of the cosmos and universe that is represented by calligraphy and life and revived by paint.  Jules Dedet Granel better known as L'Atlas was born in 1978 near Toulouse, but he grew up in Paris where he started street writing and tagging in 1991, being inspired by hip hop and rap emerging culture. The artist studied History of Art and Archeology in Toulouse where he met Smail Bour Quaiba, a traditional calligraphist, on whose invitation he spent three months in Morocco learning classical calligraphy. Then he went to Egypt, where he accidently come to know Munir al Shaarani, a Syrian refugee, known for his modern approach in which he combines three forms, calligraphy, design, and architecture, all in one. Other than that, the author also traveled to Syria, China, Greece and other places where he upgraded his knowledge, but Arabic touch remained dominant in his art. His works remind of an intersection between geometric abstraction and minimalism where every letter is a form, and every form is a letter. Most of his pieces are in black & white combination which he finds as a form of resistance and a binding line between the people and the city. At the same time, this choice when applied to his photos is used as a reading tool, and as a reminder of the things that have disappeared.   As the artist admits, a very big influence on him had Daniel Buren, who created a link between conceptual art and public spaces. While creating, the author uses his paintings as meditative objects. During his visit to China’s mountains, he was introduced with Tai-Chi, which he compares with his painting process because both have certain gestures and moves that are repeated until perfection is reached. L’Atlas tries to put together his interest in geography, maps, and archeology on one side together with his devotion to the history of writing on the other side. So it is a mixture of topography and typography. The street art for him is just a continuity of land art, consisted of the maximum use of space, so naturally he defines himself as an in-situ artist. L'Atlas’ pictorial universe is used to represent cities through geometrical and graphical labyrinths and compasses, which is primitive and contemporary at the same time.   In 1998 the artist met Agnes B. while tagging her delivery truck, and since then, they have collaborated on a number of projects, L’Atlas’ work was also printed on her t-shirts. In 2001 this French multi-talented guy decided to change spray-cans for the tape and focused on Kufi, geometric code which he transposes into the Latin alphabet. He also designed a sparkling water bottle for Perrier brand. In 2015 he participated in a project called Extraordinaire that is the biggest project in his career so far. It consists of four different monumental installations, as a part of a global interactive performance, in four cities, New York, Mexico City, Seoul, and Paris. The idea is to use four elements, Earth, Air, Water, and Fire as media, with each carrying a certain message. The project he is most proud of is taking photographs of his first seven works on his journeys around the world. L’Atlas’ art can be seen in numerous streets, galleries, and exhibitions in various cities around the world like Miami, Rome, Paris, Jakarta, Marrakech, and Moscow.  ",1274
Jef Aerosol,"From pioneering street art to achieving a status of the legend, Jean-François Perroy, better known as Jef Aérosol, is without a doubt one of the most famous artists in the contemporary world. Slowly honing the skills and building up his reputation, this master of stencil inspired generations of youngsters who ventured into the wilderness of the city jungles, following the footsteps of their hero, hoping to leave their own mark, just as Aérosol did. Many cities around the globe have been blessed with his pieces, and countless portraits of both famous people and the ordinary ones, immortalized by the artist, now greet anyone that walks by. Black, white, and gray dominate his art, usually accompanied by the red arrow, the artist’s trademark, and a powerful graphic element on its own.  The sevens marked his early life. He was born in 1957, along with the rock. The hippie movement formed a decade later. In 1977, the punk wave was strong and engulfing. These three dates describe an effervescent era, marked by the pop revolution in the musical sense, as well as in artistic. Aérosol grew up in Nantes, surrounded by the labor culture of his parents. Constantly seeking to escape the seriousness of the adult world and to somehow bridge the enormous generation gap, he sought everything that came from places like New York or London, embracing the incredible dream which accompanied the phenomenon such as Beatles. His artistic career began through copy-art, which stands for using photocopiers to create artworks. It was the ‘thing’ in the late 70’s, and the fact that he was using a tool whose purpose wasn’t for creating art made it even more interesting. The artist thinks the copy-art didn’t have a particularly strong influence on his stencil, as they are completely different techniques, except for the speedy aspect.  Aérosol emphasizes the significance of the night when he created his first stencil – it was 1982, in Tours, and the moment he painted over the prepared pattern was the moment he got hooked. Naturally, the feeling has changed and evolved over years, but he still feels excited every time he works on a piece. At the time, the stencil was new, and was directly connected to his young age, but also to the period of the early 80’s and those are essentially the reasons he was so attracted to it. But even with the passing of time and change in sensations, ideas, context, feelings, Aérosol still finds working in the streets enjoyable and fulfilling.  Unaware of their work when he began his own, Aérosol eventually saw the pieces made by Blek le Rat and Speedy Graphito and was partially inspired by them. Especially le Rat’s choice of black and white and the size of his pieces. Today, the three of them are thought of as pioneers of stencil art, and one would expect that there is some sort of associated pressure or expectations. Aérosol denies the presence of pressure, but also declines any special status followed by the titles. As he states, the fame and hierarchy do not interest him. There is no other choice as long as he follows his own road and feels deep within himself that he still has to do what he does. This kind of thinking and acting turned Aérosol into an icon, who is now himself an inspiration to other urban artists, like the omnipresent Banksy or another French street art legend, C215.   Aérosol’s most notable feature is certainly his portraits. It comes as no big surprise since he’s always been interested in them and in the representation of man generally. The idea of showing that each and every one of us is just a face in the crowd has prevailed throughout his career. Depicting his life-size figures, dominantly black and white (there are exceptions of course) as a freeze frame of the film of life, the artist is able to perfectly capture the single moment in the never-ending flow of the city crowd. The choice of color emphasizes the reference to cinema and equally affirms the desire not to fall into a trompe-l’oeil. These characters are living shadows, Aérosol claims, acting as a mirror for those who see them. More so, the viewers have a tendency to identify with images. For example,  his Sitting kid speaks to anyone, from kids themselves, adults thinking about their own children, to older people, reviving some distant memories. Speaking of icons, Joe Strummer, Johnny Cash, Sid Vicious, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, Brigitte Bardot, Curt Cobain, John Lennon, Patti Smith, Mick Jagger, Elves Presley, Gandhi, James Dean, Keith Harington, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Jackson Pollock, Marcel Duchamp, Bob Dylan, Jane Birkin, Robert Smith, Robert Plant, and many more, all of them painted in human-scale, exactly the same as his anonymous figures, reversing their status to the level of the ordinary people. Every single portrait, every single face represents Aérosol’s hero, be it a movie star, musician, or a fellow artist. Even the anonymous characters carry a specific meaning for Aérosol. Considering this, his collaboration with Lee Jeffries came almost naturally. The artistic chemistry was sparked between the two masters, one photographer, the other a street artist, when they met in London in 2014. Jeffries’ portrait of the homeless people had a powerful impact on Aérosol, who proposed a collaboration that culminated in the Synergy, an exhibition held at Mathgoth gallery in March 2015. The joint exhibition shows and further explores their mutual affection for creating portraits, combining their respective talents, and forging a strong relationship between stencil art and photography.    The famous Red Arrow came a little by chance in the 80’s and has since become a trademark, Aérosol’s second signature. It’s a very urban symbol, a recognizable sign of the international urban signage. Its geometric shape made of lines and angles contrasts with the curves of his human figures, and the redness points to a detail or to the entire piece, attracting the eye toward his black and white silhouettes. Many have tried to unearth a different explanation, but there is none, the artist claims. Speaking of the perfect location for a new artwork, Aérosol doesn’t have a strict set of rules, which he then universally applies. It’s more about the traveling itself, letting go of all the preconceptions, walking the streets, seeing with your own eyes. There is, however, one peculiar rule the artist always abides – whenever he paints without explicit permission, it’s always with great respect for the context, the places, and people. For example, when he worked in places with major historical and cultural significance, like Venice or the Great Wall of China, he did all he could do to avoid being seen as profane or even provocative. In truth, it’s the exact opposite for him. There was no way he could disrespect the history of the old stones, so the artist painted on the paper tablecloth, which is light and fragile material. The properties of the paper allow its bonding with the stone, providing a perfect illusion of a piece painted on the wall. Over the years, murals have become another trademark of his, whether he’s doing them alone or is collaborating with others. Comparing the sense of belonging of such a piece with the one he painted himself, Aérosol says there is no difference at all. It’s the same with the type of work – live-scale street stencil, an enormous mural, or the gallery piece, it’s all the same to him. It’s all his.    After working hard and fruitfully for an almost a decade, he slowed down in 1992. Due to the teaching responsibilities, making music, buying a house, and being a father, Aérosol made fewer stencils on the streets. In 2002, he returned to the streets with a clear perspective and human size pieces, now thought of as his usual. In 1986, he wrote the very first book on the subject of street art - Fait, Bien Fait, or Done Quickly, Done Well in English. Nowadays, he’s busier than ever, with schedule booked until the end of the year, like it was in 2014 and 2015. There’s simply no time for everything he wants to do – he stopped playing music, gave up teaching as well. All of his creativity and strength is poured into his art, and as long he’s able to produce, he’ll be doing so.  He is represented by Galerie Zimmerling & Jungfleisch in Saarbrücken, Germany, Wunderkammern in Milan, Wunderkammern in Rome, Galerie Martine Ehmer in Bruxelles, David Pluskwa Art Contemporain in Marseille, The French Art Studio in London and Galerie Laurent Strouk in Paris.

Paul Insect,"Paul Insect is a British street artist, most famous for his first solo show Bullion exhibition at London's Lazarides Gallery, when famous Damien Hirst  purchased the show days before it opened. Insect also goes by the name of PINS. Paul was born in southeastern England. He studied graphic design for 4 years at Hastings and Salisbury art colleges. He has executed some of the most celebrated and provocative exhibitions in recent memory for which he draws inspiration from the absurdum of Dada, combined with the sleekness of modernism, yielding surreal renderings that point playfully at the deep dark underbelly of adult life. In the 1990s, Insect became known for his witty stencil and spray painted works, before transitioning to the gallery scene with color-drenched canvases, which teetered precariously between tradition and something far more messed up. Never before has chaos been channeled in such clean lines. Along with eye-popping gallery exhibitions, Insect has established himself as one of street art’s seminal figures. Known for his visceral pop style, Insect mixes bright colors with morbid themes, Donald Duck and Pinocchio brandishing guns and bombs, while human skulls sport multi-hued Playboy bunny ears. His self-portrait in bronze, “Pixel-man” has a computer-headed body melting, clutching a keyboard, while a second set of arms are tied behind his back. Insect’s work has evolved from Victorian graphics to Dada-esque collage. There is primitiveness to his aggressive subject matter that is almost disguised by his joyous use of color and entertaining style. Insect’s dark content lends itself to a fun, playful display of baby heads split open, Bishops on i-books and smoking joints with clown hair and mice noses, skeletal playboy bunnies adorned in bling and angels clutching syringes. His images are provoking yet light-hearted and demand a sense of morality that transcends common acceptance. Paul Insect's images are provoking and prodigious, dripping as much with sensitivity and gravitas as they are with sex and death. His refined interpretations of visceral subject matter depict the frustrations of a modern man, teeming with unkempt aggression and sexuality, but yearning for a higher moral purpose. Insect has painted alongside Banksy at The Can Festival, produced album art for DJ Shadow and has worked on the separation wall in Palestine. His work can be spotted everywhere from the streets of London to LA or Stockholm to Sydney. Paul Insect lives in London.",1276
XOOOOX,"XOOOOX (pronounced “zooks”) is Berlin based street-artist known for guerrilla-style who works with delicate stenciled works and installations in an Arte Povera style that consist of weathered and decaying materials. He was born 1979 and started with classical graffiti at the age of 15. He never went to art school so instead of that he taught himself by practicing under railway bridges and while travelling around big cities like Frankfurt, Munich and Cologne. XOOOOX is, in fact, regarded as the first German street artist that has come to prominence on the international art market. Though the artist’s works can be seen throughout the city his identity remains a secret to prevent against charges of public vandalism. In his works, XOOOOX distinctly contrasts the glamour of fashion culture with existentialist themes such as vulnerability and transience. The life-size stencils of professionally styled photo models form the leitmotif of the figurative studies and scrutinize the worship cult and the seduction techniques of haute couture. Beguilingly beautiful, XOOOOX's women convey a sense of melancholy and introversion and allude to the growing displeasure with the uniform, consumption-driven hype of the fashion industry. Using transitory media such as exposed building facades, worm-eaten wood, rotting fabric and rusty metal, XOOOOX grounds this apparently glamorous theme in the street, but the artist’s aim is not to deconstruct fashion culture. XOOOOX pays homage to traditional haute couture while levelling criticism at the over-industrialization of fashion as a cultural artefact of our time. XOOOOX’s work, whether on the streets of Berlin or in a gallery setting, conveys the dynamics between standard ideas of beauty and ruin. Grimy buildings and rough, untraditional art surfaces like raw wood, parquet flooring, or copper sheets are adorned with gorgeous women, often appropriated from photographs of fashion models, seductively glancing out to their viewers, who may be either art enthusiasts or simply random passerby. Many of the women are surrounded by the letters X and O, which doubly act as the artist’s signature and imply that it is XOOOOX himself that the women are thinking of, implying a strong personal connection between the artist and his women.  The transgressive quality of XOOOOX's graffiti is reinforced by the fact that the stencil technique that he uses originates in political tagging traditionally done by military and revolutionary organizations.Thus, XOOOOX's work is full of paradoxes. It is beautiful and focused on stunning models, and yet also becomes integrated into grungy environments and materials; it is optimistic and yet subversive.These qualities make his work so full of life, as his women seem to tell their stories from the walls that they rest upon. If you want to see more of XOOOOX's work you can check out his first monograph edited by Benjamin Wolbergs and published by Gestalten. The book is focused mainly on artist's portraits of female models that he prefers to stencil or wheat-paste onto surfaces of older buildings scarred by the passage of time. The contrast between the strikingly beautiful women and the crumbling walls is a fundamental aspect of his creative vision.  ",1277
Swiz,"Swiz is a French artist, working both on the streets and in the studio. His preferred canvases are walls of abandoned places and streets in Paris suburbia. Whether he uses spray paint or acrylics, the visual experimentation has led Swiz to develop a style that echoes the great Futurism movement. The artist deconstructs the words, ties and unties them enough to create alphabetical matter. And like in a clever game made of facets, all you have to do is focus on one of his works to find the combination and decipher the message it conveys.   Born in Paris, Swiz began painting graffiti in 2000 without any art education. He spent a few years painting abandoned places. Walking on the streets of the French capital and exploring no-man's-land, everything became an opportunity for the artist. So he grabbed it, transformed those places into his own playgrounds and created a visual password left for the viewers to figure out. Talking about his early graffiti memories Swiz says: ""As every graffiti writer, I had good and bad experiences. I now think that painting outside is something natural and a sane reaction to the city. What is more important for me is to keep on painting in an evolutive way with open-minded people.""   Echoing the Bauhaus, his letters are playfully juxtaposed, creating a unique style based on the logics of the mathematics of shapes, or even of words. Playing with words and typographic rules, Swiz's letters turn into shapes that divide and overlap, creating a sort of a jigsaw. He is consistently working with letter forms, creating some of the most progressive and interesting graffiti aesthetics. The disorder of abandoned places gave him the urge for an organization, or rather the desire to confer a meaning to his work.  Swiz described his visual style by saying: ""I rarely use spray cans in recent years. Even when I paint traditional graffiti in the streets, I use paint and rollers, because it's cheaper and non-toxic (and people think it's legal!) . That led me to learn how to use different tools and create my own colors, and not be dependent of a brand's color-chart.  Even if my studio work is based on a precise geometric way to encrypt letters, I never paint with a sketch. I sketch my paintings directly on the medium, one line leads to another one and I never know where this line will end. It is the same process for colors, one suggests another one.""  The artist is represented by several galleries, including Mmartproject, David Bloch Gallery, and 44309 Street//art Gallery.  ",1278
Francis Bacon,"Imagine you can foresee the future, and yet be completely powerless to make it happen as it's foreseen. Francis Bacon knew this all too well, as his ideas were always transformed by the paint and his pieces never really became what he has imagined. They were all accidents. What made him one of the best-known artists in history was his ability to select which part of those accidents he wanted to preserve. He saw painting as a perfect way to express himself, to rise above words. Bacon was an Irish-born British Figurative painter, renowned for his raw, emotionally charged images. He is considered to be one of the most important and influential British painters in Post-World War II period. Largely self-taught, Bacon created in Expressionism, Surrealism, and Cubism.   Francis Bacon was born on October 28, 1909, in Dublin to English parents. His father was a former Army captain while his mother came from a wealthy family. As a child, Bacon was diagnosed with asthma, which his father didn’t take very well. A weak child, Francis couldn’t participate in all the activities associated with the everyday life in the countryside. As he was growing up, he became aware of his homosexuality, as did this family. They didn’t accept it, and in 1926, Bacon, only 16 at the time, was kicked out of his house. Shunned by his family, Francis moved to London that same year. He could barely make ends meet for several months, as his mother would send him only 3 pounds a week. In 1927, the artist’s father sent him to Berlin with a friend. Francis was overwhelmed by Berlin’s beauty and culture. He was mesmerized by the architecture and art, and above all – cinema. It is possible that in Berlin, Bacon saw Battleship Potemkin for the first time. However, the influence that this motion picture by Sergei Eisenstein had on the artist would become noticeable later in his life. A few months later, Bacon moved to Paris. It was there that he really started considering an art career. Two important things happened to him while in France, which probably swayed him towards art. He saw The Massacre of the Innocents, a painting by Nicholas Poussin, and he went to an exhibition of Picasso’s paintings. Amazed by Picasso’s works, Francis took a pencil himself and without any knowledge, he began drawing. This eye-opening experience prompted him to stay in Paris, where he continued to frequent art galleries and shows and to “learn from them”. However, in 1928, he decided to go back to London and start a business.   Francis became a furniture and interior designer. Creating in glass and steel, he mainly drew inspiration from his contemporaries and modernists like Eileen Gray and Le Corbusier. The artist became acquainted with Roy de Maistre, an Australian painter, who showed him the ropes of oil painting. The two even had a joint exhibition in 1930. However, he couldn’t make enough money off of his paintings or furniture, and he moved to Chelsea, London. It was in 1933 that Francis Bacon did his first critically acclaimed painting titled Crucifixion. But this painting wasn’t enough to establish him as an artist yet. His works didn’t sell as much as they should have, and he was even turned down by the International Surrealist Exhibition in London in 1936 because his paintings weren’t surreal enough. Unfortunately, not many pieces from his formative years survived, since the artist himself destroyed them. During the World War II, Francis painted only a few pieces. Those were mainly influenced by the ruins of bombarded London, and by the poems of T.S.Eliot.   The pivotal year in Bacon’s career was undoubtedly 1944 when he finished his triptych called Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which propelled him to the center of the art world. The paintings were exhibited the following year at the Lefevre Gallery and were highly praised by both public and critics. In the orange background, each painting captures a stone-colored monster which barely even looks like a human being. It was later acquired by Eric Hall (who was also Bacon’s lover of 15 years), who subsequently presented it to the Tate Gallery in 1953. In 1945, Francis painted another piece which would cement his fame; the piece is simply called Painting. He first intended to paint a bird. However, the painting evolved to a complex assemblage depicting an almost headless man under an umbrella. Painting ensured him several group exhibitions and a contract with the Hanover Gallery. Three years after the creation of the artwork, the Museum of Modern Art in New York obtained it.   Bacon had his first one-person exhibition in 1949 at the Hanover Gallery. The paintings were very simple and focused on only one figure, with often disturbing details like open mouths, diverting the viewers’ attention from the rest of a composition. Such was the Head series created between 1948 and 1949. What is interesting about this series is that Francis painted it on the wrong side of canvases. He realized that the paint and the texture looked better on it, and decided to stick to it, which he did until his death. One particular piece caught everyone’s attention, and that was Head IV, which was the artist’s earliest variation on Portrait of Pope Innocent X from 1650 by Velázquez. This piece was also influenced by Battleship Potemkin film, and a video still of a screaming nurse. Francis completed his Study after Velázquez’s Portrait of Pope Innocent X in 1953 and had also finished a series entitled Study of Portrait I-VIII. During this period, Bacon also produced several thematically different paintings. Most were influenced by his trips to Africa when he was visiting his mother who had moved there after Bacon’s father’s death. He also created a series titled Man in Blue I-VII, which he completed in 1954.   For some time in the 50s, Francis lived between Morocco and London, while his art became known worldwide, and he was gaining an international renown. In 1953, he had his first solo exhibition in New York, and four years later in Paris. During this time, the painter’s style was beginning to change, in terms of color and handling. The exhibition at the Hanover Gallery featured yet another series of his which consisted of six pieces that were inspired by Van Gogh’s The Painter on the Route to Tarascon. The change was evident in texture, which became rougher, and in colors, which became brighter and more vibrant. Bacon would continue with this style until the end of his life. Several years after the show, in 1962, the painter completed his first large-scale triptych called Three Studies for a Crucifixion. He once stated that it had been the first time he had managed to paint while intoxicated. It was a liberating experience for him. That same year, the Tate Gallery organized the first major retrospective exhibition, which included not only this triptych but also 90 other artworks.   Sometime around this period, Francis met George Dyer with whom he had fallen in love. Infatuated, Francis chose Dyer as a recurrent subject of his works in the 60s. He started using photographs, as they enabled him to convey the vitality of the subjects to the canvas. Some critics say that this was the most fruitful and mature period in his career. The death of George Dyer in 1972 proved to be a surge in Bacon’s career. He painted several series and triptychs dedicated to his late lover’s life and death – some of the bleakest and most somber of his pieces. The greatest of them was certainly Triptych May-June, completed in 1973. Simple, and yet incredibly powerful, the triptych describes the last days of Dyer’s life.   From the mid-70s onward, many one-person and retrospective exhibitions had been organized worldwide. Another retrospective was held at the Tate in 1985, with over a hundred paintings displayed this time. Francis was also the first Western artist to exhibit in the Soviet Union in 1988. His style still continued to progress and develop – he now tackled landscapes. Some of his notable works from this period include Landscape from 1978, and A Piece of Waste Land, which he painted in 1982. The latter was influenced by T.S. Eliot’s poem The Waste Land. During the 80s, Bacon’s subjects became even simpler, reduced to only a stump and a pair of legs. This period yielded two important artworks: the triptych Three Studies for a Portrait of John Edwards from 1984, and Study for Self-Portrait, Triptych, 1986.   The last years of his life, Bacon spent in a relationship with a young Spanish man. In spite of his doctor’s advice, he went to Madrid in 1992 and suffered a heart attack only a few days upon his arrival. He was then cremated, and his ashes were transferred to Britain and later scattered in a private ceremony. His art continues to amaze people to this day, as his paintings are still displayed at numerous venues around the world. His artworks are a part of many public and private collections worldwide. The artist is represented by Hang-Up Gallery London, Gagosian Park & 75 New York, Gagosian West 24th Street New York, Gagosian Madison Avenue New York, Gagosian Britannia Street London, Gagosian Beverly Hills, Gagosian West 21st Street New York, Tony Shafrazi Gallery in London, Marlborough Gallery Monaco, Marlborough Fine Art London, Markowicz Fine Art Gallery in Miami, Puccio Fine Art.

Thierry Noir,"Thierry Noir is the man to whom we owe the longest concrete painting in the world. His paintings, with their bright colors and their melancholy poetry, represent nowadays the art of the Berlin wall. His wall works survived longer than all the others even after the fall of the wall in 1989. Thierry Noir was born in 1958 in Lyon, France. He came to Berlin in January of 1982 with two small suitcases, attracted by the music of David Bowie and Iggy Pop, who lived in West-Berlin at this time. By chance he settled in a squat overlooking the Wall at the border of East and West Berlin. One day in 1984 Noir spontaneously started to paint the Wall and continued to do so each day for five years with whatever paint he could scavenge from nearby construction sites. Noir's aim was not to embellish the Wall but to demystify it.  When asked, in one of his interviews, about his relation to the wall and his motifs to paint it he said: ""I wanted to cover the wall with colors to wrap it up with paintings, to make it luminous, to show it like a mutation in the city, a mutation in art and nature. One hundred and thirty people were killed trying to jump over the Berlin Wall to escape West Berlin, so it cannot be beautiful."" Noir had to work quickly to fill the concrete panels so as not to be discovered or chased away by the border patrol while painting.These restrictions determined his style: heads in profile with full lips outlined by simple black lines like in a comic, painted two-dimensionally and in bright colors. One head fit on one or two vertical Wall panels. After a little while, each of Noir’s painted panels got an individualized face. Since this time, Noir's exploits and highly distinctive visual language have become world famous and immortalised in popular culture such as Wim Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire and the cover of U2's album Acthung Baby. Noir is today being increasingly recognised as a key forerunner of the modern street art movement and in 2013 worked outdoors in London alongside renowned international street artists of the current generation such as Phlegm and ROA.",1281
Christopher Wool,"On the legacy of linguistic experiments of conceptual artists, the work of Christopher Wool was developed but with a certain critical distance and pop sensibility typical for the 80’s, the period when the artist started. Namely, by focusing on text and appropriating neo-expressionist tendencies of the times, he set off on a peculiar task not only to question the very nature of an abstract artwork in the contemporary moment, yet to explore the wide array of problematic places in the broader context of the art world. That journey led him to establish highly conceptual artistic practice expressed through painting, sculpture, and photography.  Christopher Wool was born in 1955 in Boston. His parents were highly educated, father a molecular biologist and a mother psychiatrist. The artist grew up in Chicago, but in 1973, he moved to New York City and enrolled in Studio School studies with Jack Tworkov and Harry Krame. Shortly after formal training as a painter at the New York Studio School, he dropped out and immersed himself in the world of underground film and music. Between 1980 and 1984, he worked as part-time studio assistant to Joel Shapiro. Throughout the NY circle of artists of all sorts, he gradually started exhibiting the works and as the times passed by his career rapidly started growing.  The artist usually expresses his ideas through several mediums such as paper, photography, and painting. As a matter of fact, Christopher Wool began developing his style during the mid-1970’s, when he started creating abstract paintings that included multiple mark makings. The influences can be definitely found in conceptual art, Minimalism, and even Pop art, so such a fusion of different referential points provided him with the solid base for constructing his personal aesthetic. Wool’s work simultaneously draws from the recent history of art and points to entirely new possibilities for the future of painting. At the heart of his creative project, which now spans more than three decades, is the question of how a picture can be conceived, realized, and experienced today.  Since Christopher Wool was occupied with experimentation in painting in those years, it was quite difficult for him to rise above in New York because the very media was not seen anymore as relevant. Despite the situation, the artist was persistent and used modern tools to perfect his works like spray, screens, stencils, rags, solvents, air guns, etc. Wool saw differently the possibilities of gestural mark-making on a surface and even used photographs of his own paintings as sources for new paintings. Also, he used particular surfaces like aluminum or linen grounds anew through silkscreen, either alone on a surface or in combination with enamel. Therefore, it can be said that Wool created paintings that are highly reminiscent of wallpaper, whether they include large monochrome letters that are at sometimes difficult to discern, or not.   According to the story told by the artist himself, Wool began to create word paintings in the late 1980s after having seen graffiti on a brand new white truck. Nevertheless, the works are not the just mere depiction of certain phrases; the words are often broken up by a grid system or with the vowels removed. Apparently, it is not only the change of the meaning of the word that intrigues Wool, but it’s visual aspect as well. The paintings that followed are perhaps Wool’s most recognizable images, employing large passages of text from cultural idioms or song lyrics from popular culture. Wool provides tension between painting and erasing, gesture and removal, depth and flatness.  Besides his signature text paintings, Wool has amassed a large body of black-and-white photographs taken at night in the streets of the Lower East Side and Chinatown. They are somehow reminiscent of film noir aesthetic and the first series were shot in the mid-1990s, but the project was resumed and completed in 2002. Taken at night using a 35mm camera, the pictures feature the neighborhood’s signature streets, with their dilapidated storefronts and ramshackle staircases leading up to anonymous spaces. Like his paintings, Wool’s photographs hover between abstraction and representation. One hundred and sixty photographs were gathered in a book called East Broadway Breakdown which was issued by Holzwarth Publications in 2004.  The same problems occupy Wool in the following decades when he adopted the silkscreen as a primary tool. The dense configurations of various motifs span across his paintings, sometimes interrupted by large passages of smudges of spray-paint that evoke an act of vandalism on a city street. Since his whole practice is related to the urban experience, so the scenes of alienation and decay collected in his photographic series make this connection explicit, their fugitive compositions resonating with the vocabulary of his paintings.  The list of honors he received is huge, but to name the few, Wool has been named a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome (1989), served as a DAAD Berlin Artist-in-Residence (1992), and received the Wolfgang Hahn Prize. In 2010, he was honored with amfAR’s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS. Over the past decade, his work has experienced substantial growth and recognition. Starting out as a Neo-Pop painter, Christopher Wool explored painting’s elusive and allusive qualities with a variety of methods including using commercial rollers to apply decorative patterns on white panels. Even today the works of Christopher Wool are equally engaging, and quite strikingly questions still relevant questions of meaning and value of an artwork in accordance with contemporaneity. ",1282
Kour Pour,"Kour Pour is British/Iranian artist who deals with the concept of Persian tribal textile designs synthesizing the traditional cultural patterns into paintings representing the rituals of the animal hunt with vibrant colors and faded symbolism. His painting communicates the impact of reproduction and what happens to culture/meaning/society when it is represented in different media such as the internet and digital images, playing with issues of authenticity and simulation. The rug paintings are hand painted and then sanded to create a faded or antiqued effect. The image of the carpet looks textured but is actually flat, much like what happens to an image online from where Pour obtains his source material. Born in Exter, England, Pour later  graduated in 2010 on BFA, Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles. During his childhood he remembers his beginnings  saying :""Carpets were a part of my childhood growing up in England. I remember my Father’s rug shop, and how he would hand-dye sections of carpets that had faded away, in order to bring them back to their original colors. I felt that in doing this, my Father was making an effort to maintain all their history and meaning, as if he was bringing the carpets back to life."" As he moved to Los Angeles he felt that his own history partially disappeared, much like what happened to those carpets.  For Kour Pour, Persian carpets aren't simply decorative artifacts; his meticulous and attentive selection of rugs dating from the 16th century to the 1960's traces a history of the modern age. The commingling of imageries in these paintings points to ancient encounters between different cultures and the resulting compositions are a testament to those early exchanges that led to the development of modern taste. By recreating carpets, Pour highlights their meaning as object, as well as the implications of their surface design. They signify an object of privilege (as their originals come from an auction catalog), and our commodity-based consumer culture. Beyond that, the patterns of animals and men on horses is representational of globalization, a culture’s history, and more. Pour currently lives and works in Los Angeles.",1283
Anders Gjennestad,"Anders Gjennestad, aka STRØK, is a talented stencil artist from Norway. He mainly works on the streets, but his indoors multi-layered artwork has been exhibited in many galleries around Europe. His works are done with utmost perfection when it comes to details, and he carefully makes each piece using his own photographs as inspiration. When he photographs, he usually chooses a black and white method. His stencils are highly detailed, as he thoughtfully makes them by hand and plans them in advance. He adds multiple layers to his work and recreates the photographic visuals on the stencil surface.  Anders Gjennestad was born in Arendal, Norway, in 1980 and he is a self-taught artist. He currently lives in Berlin, where he creates most of his street art, but he exhibits and paints all over the continent. What he does now, he achieved by the combination of hard work and dedication. In a search for inspiration, he wanders the city, looking for the abandoned factories and unoccupied houses. When choosing materials, he considers how well they will age, survive various weather conditions, and how will their texture degrade over time. The incorporation of all these characteristics gives his stencils a unique property.   STRØK's theme includes subjects that seem to inhabit an alternative universe, where there are no familiar laws of physics. The characters do not follow the laws of gravity, and they are often portrayed upside down, inhabiting the factory walls and complementing their aged surface. In a dimension where his characters exist, there is no time, nor rules. Gjennestad's stencils are placed on scratched walls, rusted metal, and degrading plaster-work, creating an interesting texture. The spontaneous transformation that happens over time, emphasizes their complex character.   The artist often chooses not to tag his work. By choosing not to sign his work, he states out that the street art belongs to everyone. His mission is to share the artwork, to send a message and leave a trace, that does not necessarily have to be associated with his name. His stencils rely on the interaction with the viewer, and their relation with the surface they are on. However, his gallery work is always done under his name. Anders Gjennestad mindfully chooses the materials and the placement for his stencils, giving his subjects a unique ability to interact with space. The artist is represented by Mathgoth Gallery.

Wayne Thiebaud,"With his iconic paintings serving as a trademark of American contemporary art, Wayne Thiebaud is a Pop art painter best known for his colorful works depicting commonplace objects like pies, lipsticks, paint cans, ice cream cones, pastries and hot dogs, although he has painted many landscapes and figures in his time as well. Although Wayne is considered to be a key piece of the Pop art, Thiebaud never truly accepted the concepts of this movement, instead sticking to the original combination of his own and Pop's ideas, refusing to evolve alongside other representatives of the movement. This painter based his work on making a parody out of commercialism and consumer society, becoming a true craftsman of advertising, cartoons and marketing illustration.  Wayne Thiebaud was born to Mormon parents in Mesa, Arizona, U.S.A., during the year of 1920. His family moved to Long Beach, California, when he was just a baby. As little Wayne was growing up, he started developing an enormous affection towards comic strips and illustrations inside them, being more fascinated with the way they are drawn than what was the actual content of the comics. Naturally, he wanted to try creating such images himself. Although Thiebaud showed a gift for drawing, fine art training or even a college education seemed like remote possibilities in the depressed economy of the 1930s. Instead, he was forced to work from an early age and drawing really came as a distant second to that. One summer during his high school years, Wayne apprenticed at the Walt Disney Pictures Studio, making the so-called in-betweeners of Goofy, Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket, earning $14 a week, which was quite an impressive paycheck for a kid back then. This experience will prove to be vital in the long term. Over time, the financial situation started to brighten up, so during the year of 1949, Thiebaud enrolled at San Jose State College. Later on, Wayne transferred to Sacramento State College and earned himself a bachelor's degree in 1951, followed by a master's degree in 1952. During the midst of the fifties, Thiebaud moved to New York City with goals of becoming an artist. The Big Apple offered the young painter a chance to befriend the likes of Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, which actually proved to be a turning point for Wayne since he was heavily influenced by the way those two treated abstraction in their work.    Besides Kline and de Kooning, Thiebaud was also inspired by the works of Milton Ernest Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Wayne learned a lot in New York City and after it seemed to him there was nothing more the city could offer him, Thiebaud packed his bags and returned to California. He began experimenting with different subject matters and styles, isolating triangles, circles, squares, etc. At one point, he even had an opportunity to open his own gallery space, a chance Wayne jumped right on - the result was the Artists Cooperative gallery, now known as the Artists Contemporary Gallery. Much of the content this gallery displayed came from Thiebaud's connections with the Big Apple, so naturally the exhibitions were quite an attraction to California art fans that would otherwise not have a chance to see pieces of the New York-based artists. In the year of 1960, he had his first solo show in San Francisco at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and shows in New York City at the Staempfli and Tanager galleries soon followed. This was the first time Thiebaud was under the elite spotlight of the art scene, but little did he know that his career was about to take a huge step forward in less than a year and a half.  In 1962, Thiebaud's work was included in the historically important and ground-breaking New Painting of Common Objects, along with Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. This is considered by many to be the first Pop Art exhibitions in America and the beginning of one of the most impressive modern art movements. Thiebaud was noticed for his still lifes of edible treats and everyday objects in his singular illustrative style. Wayne has been traditionally associated with the Pop art due to his tendency to focus on objects considered to be a part of mass culture. However, since some of his works came to be during the fifties and sixties, these paintings actually predate the works of most pop artists - for that reason, it is often suggested that Thiebaud may have had a crucial influence on the movement instead of simply being a part of it. Technically speaking, Thiebaud relied on heavy pigments and exaggerated colors in order to depict his themes and subjects that were a perfect fit with the early Pop ideas. One of the instantly recognizable giveaways that you are looking at a Wayne Thiebaud painting is the well-defined shadows, characteristic to old advertisements from the fifties and sixties. His paintings of cakes, pies, pastries and toys, characteristically outlined in multiple colors, became an icon of American painting. As was hinted at the beginning, it should be noted that Wayne also painted different fantastic characters, landscapes, streetscapes and cityscapes.    When people hear someone mention Pop Art, they immediately get a little voice inside their heads that whispers the name of Andy Warhol. Without getting into the discussion if this is fair or not, we should rather try and explain why this is the case with Thiebaud as well - Wayne refused to identify himself as a Pop artist, instead preferring to be called a traditional painter of illusionistic form. This combined with the fact Thiebaud never wanted to change the world and it's perception of art ultimately saw this artist take a step back and let other representatives of Pop lead the way. Due to that humbleness and lack of arrogance, Wayne seems to be creating under the radar so to say, but do not be fooled - you are dealing with a real legend of the America's contemporary art. The artist is represented by kunzt.gallery in Miami, United States.  Featured Image: Wayne Thiebaud - Picture of the artist - Image via csus.edu All images courtesy of Wayne Thiebaud",1285
Martin Kippenberger,"Describing himself as someone who wants to change the mood of things, Martin Kippenberger has done much more. The legacy of this German multi-talented artist counts in hundreds of different pieces that include paintings, sculptures, and installations. He is considered one of the most influential and experimental post-war artists, who combined styles like Expressionism, Dada forward, including photo-realism, performance, pop art, Neo-Expressionism, and Social Realism. Martin was also the organizer of a number of exhibitions, both of his works, and of his colleagues. The variety of themes that he used, often contained political connotations and expressed critique of the modern consumer society. Kippenberger grew up in the 1970’s during the era of punk and rock culture, which was the time of cosmopolitism, intellectuals, and the rise of the leftist radicalism.   Kippenberger was born in 1953 in Dortmund, Germany, as the only son out of five children. Soon after the death of his father, who was a director of the Katharina-Elisabeth colliery, Kippenberger began to study at the Hochschule für Bildende Kunst in Hamburg. Here he had the opportunity to learn from the famous painter Sigmar Polke. After the graduation, he visited many places in Europe like Paris, Florence, Cologne, and Berlin, where he got involved in music, painting, and writing novels. Martin’s obsession with rock ’n’ roll, diverse stage names, and record labels show the level of his charisma and energy that were expressed through his art. Besides recording songs like Luxus with his punk band, the artist also directed short performances and films. His life can be described as the one of a music star, consisted of parties, alcohol, fights, sex, and sometimes compared with Werner Fassbinder. During the 1970’s the artist managed the club S.O.36 where he performed, often replacing the scheduled acts. During the 1980’s he became the member of the Cologne art scene and was one of the founders of the Lord Jim Lodge painters fraternity, whose members are today's well known German artist such as Arnulf Rainer, Albert and Markus Oehlen, Jörg Schlick, and others.    Kippenberger’s specific drawing skills can only be compared with the ones of the legendary Picasso and Matisse, simultaneously manipulating with found objects and images as the renowned Duchamp. What really makes the author different from the others is his eagerness for constant experimentation and his sociability. The open-mindedness and readiness to cooperate with all kinds of people can be seen in the wide range of styles, techniques, and mediums incorporated in his work. His sculptures and installations directly opposed widely accepted norms of the art world. Whether through humor, irony, or sarcasm the artist twisted status quo concepts, featuring a caustic commentary on everything he didn’t find comfortable with. It is not strange to see provocative imagery and eye-catching motifs that sometimes represent Martin himself, aimed at disturbing and shocking the viewers. In addition to this, in 1990 Kippenberger created Feet First, a self-mocking sculpture of a crucified frog with an egg and a beer mug, as a reaction to the critique. Multiple disciplines that he employs can be seen in a series of paintings, like the  Blass vor Neid steht er vor deiner Tür from 1981, in which the artist combines 21 canvases and presents them as one.    As someone who always enjoyed whatever he did, Martin Kippenberger was known as a person who collected, accumulated, and accepted gifts from many contemporaries. Due to his premature death, because of the liver failure in 1997, the world has lost an influential artist. In a book dedicated to him, Martin’s sister introduced him as ‘an anarchist and a gentleman’ who ‘really was a child his whole life’. During his career, and especially after he died, Kippenberger’s artworks were displayed in numerous galleries and museums. In 2003, Kippenberger represented Germany at the Venice Biennale with Candida Höfer, and had retrospective exhibitions, at the Tate Modern, in 2006 and the Problem Perspective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2008. In 2014 series of sculptures and other works were displayed at the Capitain Petzel Gallery, Berlin, or in 2009 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. His pieces could also be seen at the Capitain Petzel Gallery in Berlin, at the Grimm Gallery, Amsterdam, or at the Galerie Gisela Capitain in Cologne.  ",1286
Anish Kapoor,"Creating brave and adventures sculptural forms, Anish Kapoor is regarded as one of the most influential sculptors of his generation. Maneuvering between various scales of works, different materials and spaces, his concave or convex mirrors swallow the viewers and recesses carved in stone and often pigmented seem as to disappear. Kapoor is a best known for his powerful site-specific works whose protrusions and voids can be interpreted as metaphysical polarities of presence and absence. The forms flow with no interruption, turning themselves inside out and the surfaces are not painted but impregnated with color.   Kapoor was born in Bombay in 1954. He moved to London in 1970’s to study at Hoesney College of Art and Chelsea School of Art where he earned his master degree. His work has been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions worldwide. Kapoor won the Turner Prize in 1991, a year after he represented Britain at the Venice Biennale, and honorary fellowships from the London Institute and Leeds University (1997), the University of Wolverhampton (1999) and the Royal Institute of British Architecture (2001). He was also awarded a CBE in 2003 and a Knighthood in 2013 for services to visual arts and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1994.    The beginnings of his career during the 80’s marked the use of natural materials as marble, granite, limestone, pigment and plaster and abstract forms with minimalistic concept characteristic by rich color and optical effect of depth. In the late 80’s and early 90’s his explorations of the matter and non-matter took him to the works that seem to recede into the distance, disappear through the walls or floors or on some other way question the idea of physical presence. In 1987, Kapoor started to exploit the stone which he later used for play with dualities like earth-sky, lightness-darkness, visible-invisible, body-mind. Eight years later, he became interested in the highly reflective surface of the polished stainless steel. Reflecting and distorting its surroundings, these mirror-like sculptures delve further into the realm of manipulations of form and space. The critic welcomed his Cloud Gate, an 110-ton piece of art created for Chicago’s Millennium Park in 2006, so as Sky Mirror, a 35-foot-diameter concave mirror placed ae Rockefeller Center in New York the same year.    Due to his outstanding work and activities within the community, no one was too surprised that Anish Kapoor was named the 2017 Genesis Prize winner. As we've already grown accustomed to by now, The Genesis Prize Foundation yearly honors individuals who have achieved distinction in their chosen profession and demonstrated dedication to the Jewish community. Kapoor found himself at the receiving end of such a prestigious reward for his Holocaust Memorial for the Liberal Jewish Synagogue in London and the 70 candles for Holocaust Memorial Day in Britain in 2015 that commemorated the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The 2017 Genesis Prize now serves the role of a creative crown to Kapoor who certainly holds this reward close to heart despite the fact he accepted so many prizes for his art during the course of his career. During the annunciation of the winner, The Genesis Prize Foundation acknowledged Kapoor as one of the most influential and innovative artists of his generation.   Staying true to his personality and previous decisions, Kapoor made a choice to donate the $1 million award - as is the custom for this prize - to organizations that will help alleviate the refugee crisis and try to expand the Jewish community’s engagement in a global effort to aid Syrian refugees. Anish explained such a decision with the following statement: As inheritors and carriers of Jewish values, it is unseemly, therefore, for us to ignore the plight of people who are persecuted, who have lost everything and had to flee as refugees in mortal danger. Outsider consciousness resides at the heart of Jewish identity and this is what motivates me, while accepting the honor of the Genesis Prize, to re-gift the proceeds to refugee causes. He also noted that he is an artist and not a politician, a fact that obliges him to speak out against indifference for the suffering of others.  During the time, Kapoor’s work more and more blurs the boundaries between the architecture, design and sculpture. Originally left India to become an engineer as his father, he became seriously interested in art and gave up his intentions. That proved to be a good life choice, considering the fact that he has become one of the best-known contemporary sculptors in the world. His art pieces can be found in several major cities on the planet and also in collection worldwide, notably at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.   This artist is represented by Scai the Bathhouse, Tokyo, We Are Partners, Paris and Weng Contemporary, Zug.   ",1287
Wade Guyton,"Engaging the formal repertory of modernism, from constructivism and Bauhaus to Minimal, Conceptual, and Appropriation art, Wade Guyton is an American contemporary painter who, by no means, seems like one. His studio isn’t filled with paint cans and tubes, there’s no haphazard array of easels, no smell of turpentine. His tool isn’t a brush. Instead, he uses an inkjet printer, choosing models suited for large-format prints. Paintings have their motifs designed on a computer, but Guyton puts them on a canvas by using a machine, while he plays with the process, giving his work unique features. This productive interaction of digital and manual has always played the central role in the artist’s practice.    Born in Hammond, Indiana, Guyton grew up in Lake City, Tennessee. His father and stepfather (both deceased) were steelworkers and his mother was a homemaker. He studied at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where he completed his BA in 1995. After moving to New York in 1996 and being twice rejected for admission to the Whitney Independent Study Program, the artist attended a Masters program at the Hunter College, which he began in 1996 and left in 1998, never really completing it.[1] During that time, Guyton studied under Robert Morris and got his first job St. Mark's Bookshop in the East Village. His next employment was at Dia:Chelsea, where he worked as a guard almost until the end when he was shortly relocated to Dan Graham’s café on the roof. Since the space closed in 2004, he received a severance pay that was sufficient enough for him to continue renting an East Village studio and apartment without having to look for another job. Around that time he began experimenting with printers, a technique that would gradually help him go from being a relatively unknown artist to becoming one of the world’s most famous, considered an innovator and a master. His job at Dia wasn’t just financially beneficial. A lot of his fellow artists worked grunt jobs there: Marlo Pascual, Lizzi Bougatsos, Meredyth Sparks, Seth Price, Nate Lowman, Bettina Funcke, Rich Aldrich. They would often get together get together and discuss Hegelian dialectics, Marxism, experimental film, post-capitalist production. As his work was getting wider attention, critics began analyzing it. Along with Kelley Walker, above-mentioned Set Price, and Tauba Auerbach, Guyton was considered as someone who’s at the forefront of a generation that has been reconsidering both appropriation and abstract art through the 21st-century lens of technology.[2] Actually, Kelley Walker and Guyton are close friends and have collaborated on many occasions. This collaboration allowed the maximum utilization of Guyton’s skill for printer practices and Walker’s screen-printing and color techniques. Roberta Smith, a famous art critic, placed Guyton with some younger painters that were countering the structures of late Modernism by revisiting the early Modernist cusp between abstraction and representation, entering the area previously populated with Malevich's robotlike peasants, Jawlensky's masks, Mondrian's flower paintings. An area where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled. Mark Grotjahn, Tomma Abts, Sergei Jensen, Eileen Quinlan, Cheyney Thompson, and of course, Wade Guyton, seek paths not taken, tangents not explored.[3]   In the 90’s, Guyton finally found the patience to make art himself (he always stated that he never really enjoyed drawing or art classes) and started making sculptures. These were made of materials more likely to be found in a Home Depot that in an art supply store. The models came from the distinctly brainy tradition of Minimalism, and the artist always gave them a Do It Yourself kind of a twist, combining elements of lowbrow and highbrow. Around 2003, his early “drawings” were filled with striking black Xs over ripped-out sheets from ’60s design books and interior catalogues. The letter X and the color back became his signature motifs. So did the letter U, flames (the black-markered series of Firestarter book covers), circles, lined grids, and Marcel Breuer chairs (he twisted a few into disfigured metal sculptures). At some point, Guyton moved from using paper to using linen, pulling gigantic swathes of fabric through the ink-jet printer while it reads from a computer file. Epson Stylus Pro 9600, Epson Stylus Pro 4000, and  Epson UltraChrome are some of the printers he’s used over the years. He accepts the source of errors, as he uses a carrier material other than the one for which the machine is conceived, and moves on to manipulate the color supplies, and deliberately jolts and pulls the material while the machine is working, creating smudges, drippings, or distortions and displacements that turn a model designed for serial reproduction into a series of original objects. In 2012, Guyton's exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American History showed his inkjet and digital paintings and other works, providing new glance into is oeuvre. Known for working in series, Guyton employs the calculated influence of chance, rendering each element of the series unrepeatable, distinctive, and ultimately, unique. The results have pictorial qualities, despite the dominance of mechanical means of production. However, at the same time, the ostensible drive toward serial work cycles negates the claim to originality usually inherent in classical painting. His work is very contemporary in that it directly involves and draws upon the immediately available technological means, a fact that differentiates him from many of other formalists. One of Guyton’s signature motifs is a black monochromatic painting. As a consequence of choosing a material not suited for the technique, the brittle ground absorbs the images, signs, and letters he continues to use in his designs much more strongly; the ink is distributed across the fabric instead of sitting directly on the surface, as in the earlier works. One thing has remained constant throughout the years – every single work displays his interventions. There are the traces of movement, the marks left by wheels in the wet ink, intermingled with the scratches and streaks the painting incurred when it was dragged across the floor in order to be fed back into the printer, and various stages of ink getting denser and denser. Even when exhibiting, Guyton seeks uniqueness. For his 2014 show at the Punta della Dogana, he chose to use the space in its horizontal dimension, leaving the walls empty.   From being a security guard to becoming one of the most famous artists in the world – it is certainly an incredible story! Guyton has become of the leading artists of his generation by messing with limits of a home-office printer,  cultivating a sort of technological picturesque. And yet, there is a dimension of his work often overlooked. By availing himself of computer technology but using it in such a way as to elicit its parapraxes, cultivating the irregularities and imperfections that expose its limitations, he humanizes the machine, showing that even something designed to work flawlessly can make mistakes. In a world that heavily relies on machines, this is an  unprecedented exploration of technology.  References:  ",1288
Vik Muniz,"Vik Muniz is a Brazilian visual artist who uses unexpected materials and everyday objects such as sugar, dust, chocolate or garbage in his procedures of creating bold, ironic and often deceiving imagery, inspired by the pop culture and history.  Muniz started to discover art in the books he borrowed from his high school library and he began his career as a sculptor in the late 1980s. However, he gradually became more interested in drawing and photography and he built his own, uniquely experimental artistic processes.  Already as a teenager, Muniz was working in the realm of visual arts. He was redesigning billboards for higher readability in his native Brazil, but after he arrived in New York City in 1983, his friend lent him a studio and he started his career as a sculptor. In addition to sculpting, Muniz began experimenting with drawing and photography and he decided to combine both approaches in his series Sugar Children, which was exhibited in MOMA in 1997. Muniz is best known for recreating famous scenes from art history and pop culture with unexpected, often edible objects. He also explored the human memory and perception through the images represented in arts and communication. For example, The Best of Life  series of drawings in the reproduction of the famous photographs Muniz have seen and remembered from the magazine Life. In the mid-1990s, in order to create witty, bold, and often deceiving images based on photojournalism and history, Muniz began to incorporate diamonds, sugar, dry pigment, caviar and wire into his photographic processes. In 1997, Muniz became well-known for his Pictures of Chocolate series, in which he used chocolate syrup to create his works. The artist borrowed imagery from popular culture and old masters of painting to make his works more familiar. He playfully calls this approach the worst possible illusion.   Waste Land is documentary from 2010, directed by Lucy Walker and it follows Vik Muniz as he travels from his home in Brooklyn to his native Brazil to see the world's largest garbage dump, Jardim Gramacho, located on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Waste Land project was being filmed for almost three years and during this time, Muniz was creating artworks from the recyclables found at Jardim Gramacho landfill. Muniz collaborated with catadores, the people employed to pick out recyclable material from garbage and he created his famous large-scale mosaic portraits. These pieces were sold at auctions in London and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in Sao Paulo. The project was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 83rd Academy Awards.   Vik Muniz is a very active artist who continuously participates in various international shows. In 2016, he joined FotoFest Biennial in Houston TX, which main topic is the preservation of natural world and the humanity’s place in such world. Featured projects in the show address the issues of climate change, industrialization, urbanization, biodiversity, energy production and handling of waste. The money Muniz has earned at FotoFest by selling his artworks from the Pictures of Garbage series was given to the garbage collectors in Brazil, so they can improve life in their communities. In additio to his carreer in visual arts, Muniz is also a great lecturer who loves to talk about the social consciousness his work is infused with. He held a famous TED talk in 2007 and was nominated as a Goodwill Ambassador by UNESCO.   Vik Muniz is an artist who finds a special delight in subverting and exceding his viewers' expectations. Because of his use of unexpected and even bizarre materials to create portraits, landscapes and still lifes, Muniz is often considered as a master illusionist. Yet, he claims that he's not interested in fooling people - he just wants to show them the power of his unique approach which is beyond the traditional artistic styles.  Muniz's work has won a lot of commercial success and great critical acclaim and has been exhibited worldwide. What's even more striking is the fact that one of his his solo shows at MAM in Rio de Janeiro was second only to Picasso in attendee numbers. The artist is represented by Pace Gallery in Beijing, Pace Gallery in HK, Pace Gallery in London, and Pace Gallery in Menlo Park.  ",1289
Friedensreich Hundertwasser,"There is little in the way of rigorous logic in Friedensreich Hundertwasser’s art. He avoided theories, preferring the realm of the senses. There is little in his introspective art of a purely speculative nature. That has irritated and confused many of his more literal-minded critics, who supposed that an art as rational as his must also be logical. Hundertwasser has been a dedicated artist and craftsman for forty years and has earned a place in the front rank of those who craft their artwork well and do not merely offer it up as an illustration of an idea. Representational art was out of fashion for decades and after a generation of minimalist colorist, the lush opulence of Hundertwasser’s colors was winning admirers by sheer force of contrast.  Hundertwasser was born on December 15, 1928, in Vienna as Friedrich Stowasser. Soon after his birth his father died. By the time he was five, he was beginning to express himself in art and in 1943, at the age of fifteen he first consciously drew in pencil, though he soon graduated to crayon and began to collect pressed flowers. Untutored, these works have already displayed distinct personality. His first watercolors show the picturesque woods and the palaces of old Vienna. During the Second World War, Hundertwasser and his mother lived in the cellar of their house near the Danube canal, where the family had been obliged to live since forced resettlement in 1938. A couple of months after the war, the young artist worked as a farmer where the vividness of the land convinced him to become a painter. He decided that only art could be the adequate expression of his feelings of nature thereafter his life’s principal concern.    In 1948, he entered the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in Robin Christian Andersen’s class, but shortly after, he chose to leave: “I felt bored and I left. I did not protest. Christian Andersen did not leave any mark.” Formal training did nothing to shape Hundertwasser’s evolution. On the other hand, the influence of Egon Schiele made a considerable impact and from his art, he derived the plastic expression of peaceful beauty, particularly impressed by his palette and the cities he conjured. Schiele’s buildings seemed vitally and soulfully human, nothing like real architecture or the houses conceived by other painters. Young artist recognized the same inner luminosity in the work of Walter Kampmann, completed with the great reputations of Paul Klee and Gustav Klimt.    In October 1950, Hundertwasser first exhibited pictures in Paris in the Galerie Librarie Palmes. That was the time when he chose the name by which he would be known thereafter. In the Slavic languages “Sto” means one hundred, thus out of Stowasser emerged Hundertwasser. He transformed his first name in 1961 when he lived in Japan for a year, from Friedrich to Friederich, then to Friedereich and finally to Friedensreich that has a double meaning as “Peace-realm”, in the sense of “peaceful”. His other names were Regentag (Rainy day), that occurred to him when he noticed how colors shine in the rain, and Dunkelbunt (Dark-colorful).    Hundertwasser’s revulsion for the rectangular rationality of the mechanism into which life is forced derives from impressions made by Austrian Baroque’s voluptuousness and the curvaceous richness of Jugendstil ornamentation. He contended that ruler-straight lines make people sick because, not occurring in nature, they incessantly subject people to an irritation for which the organism is unprepared. Spirals first appeared in his work in 1953. Possibly Jugendstil, that was still manifested all around him, in posters and paintings, in architecture, typography and book design, graphic, textiles, stamps and decorative arts, predisposed Hundertwasser to respond to the spiral form. His first architectural expression of that kind appeared in his Integrative School, Church, Office and Dwelling Complex in Frankfurt (1987). The sweeping ramps that come spiraling back upon themselves are all grass-covered and, seen from air, the building disappears. The first paintings in which the spiral occurs as a motif is Blood Flowing in a Circle and I Have a Bicycle.    One of his strongest and most enduring images, Irinaland Over the Balkans (1969), was inspired by Bulgarian actress Irina Maleeva. The original painting had been done on aluminum foil covered with layers of paper. As he revised graphic conceptions derived from it, the silkscreen was a new work, full of marvelous graphic devices. Each version of the theme became stronger, more compositionally focused. Irinaland over the Balkans bespeaks love of a woman, the land, and art. Through and above the landscape floats Irina’s face. This painting finalizes much of the artist’s previous experimentation. It reaches a new frontier of formal and technical achievement, while distilling and emotional essence.  The artist left the significant mark by creating the Hundertwasserhaus – an apartment building located in the Landstrasse district in Vienna. The vaulting joyous roofline evokes Gaudi’s Casa Mila, but the Austrian one contain a roof garden, indoor winter garden, and numerous terraces reachable by stairs from the downstairs apartments. It was built between 1983 and 1985, according to the ideas and concepts of Hundertwasser with architect Joseph Krawina as a co-author and architect Peter Pelikan as a planner. The conventional engineering shape was broken with non-organic embellishments, scattered windows, undulating stripes of color and mosaics of broken tiles and glass.    Hundertwasser strived to make his art rich in effects. He never preaches that “less is more”, but successfully animated many colors, often on small canvases rich with princely patterning. He died on February 19, 2000, and according to his wish was buried on his New Zealand farm in what he called “the garden of the happy dead”. During his whole life, he traveled extensively. Dedicated to the ecological movement, his aim was to make life livable in a humane environment. Propagating new type of architecture that must be in harmony with nature, planting trees in urban environment was to become obligatory. Hundertwasser protested for the preservation of the natural habitat, demanding a life in accordance with the natural laws. His last project named Die Grüne Zitadelle von Magdeburg was finished after his death in 2005.  ",1290
Grayson Perry,"Great chronicler and one of the most incisive commentators of the contemporary society and culture, Grayson Perry combines his subversive art with autobiographical references from his childhood and family to transvestite alter ego Claire, making distorted commentary on class, taste, consumerism, and art versus craft. Although works in various mediums, he is best known as a ceramicist who, besides traditional methods to create his pots, uses unusual techniques like embossing and photographic transfers, creating complex, animated surfaces. His sarcastic and psychologically composite narratives are in a total opposite to the conventional forms of the objects he makes, which is actually the most challenging incongruity of Perry’s work. Carrying the strong messages, his pots bring hidden comments on societal injustices and hypocrisies, questioning different historical and present-day themes. As a member of a Young British Artists generation, Perry's approach has always differed from the theoretical strivings of his peers, focusing on more colorful and extravagant aesthetic that blurs the boundaries between high and popular culture.  Grayson Perry was born in 1960 in Chelmsford, England. When he was seven years old, his father left the family which made the great impact on his whole life. He lived with his mother, stepfather, sisters and two stepbrothers. He early showed an interest in drawing and making models of planes which would later become the theme of his artworks. Hard family situation and violence that he suffered from his stepfather, forced him to retreat to his own world that sometimes involved his teddy bear toy which he adopted as the surrogate father figure. Until the late 1970’s when he was drawn into the Chelmsford punk scene, Perry was a conventional boy, interested in motorcycles and girls and even attended the school’s Combined Cadet Corps with the aim of training as an army officer. Having the tendencies to wear women’s clothes, during his teenage years he realized that he was a transvestite. Living with his father and stepmother, his unusual habit has not met with approval, and after he broke the promise that he would stop, they threw him out the home. Grayson Perry definitely decided not to go to the army, and following the advice of his teacher went to study art at Portsmouth Polytechnic where he received a BA in Fine Art in 1982. Perry's first piece of pottery has been exhibited two years before his graduation, at the New Contemporaries show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Becoming the part of the Neo Naturists group founded by Christine Binnie, Perry truly supported their strivings to revive the spirit of ‘60’s manifested through nudity life and occasional performances focused on body paint. Quitting every contact with his mother since 1990, Grayson Perry lived in squats until he met milliner Stephen Jones and musician Boy George and started to share the home with them.   Considering several ceramic traditions, such as Greek pottery and folk art, Grayson Perry creates complex surfaces, employing various techniques of glazing, incision, embossing, and photographic transfers which made him different from the simple pottery craftsman. Even more important is the fact that his aim is not to achieve a purely decorative effect, but to give meaning and encourage to contemplation, transforming the utilitarian object into the carrier of the complex social message. ""I like the whole iconography of pottery. It hasn't got any big pretensions to being great public works of art, and no matter how brash a statement I make, on a pot, it will always have a certain humility. For me the shape has to be classical invisible: then you’ve got a base that people can understand""[1]. Looking back on his childhood, Grayson Perry’s work is a reflection of his upbringing, the violence, and anger of his stepfather and lack of the male model at home. His distorted understanding of the family roles is depicted in his piece Using my Family (1998). On the other hand, Perry's pots often contain sexually explicit imagery such as obscene sadomasochistic sex scenes or juxtapose most common decorative elements like flowers with weapons and war. Besides ceramics, he also works in printmaking, drawing, tapestries, sculptures, film, and performance. Frequently appearing in public dressed in a women’s clothes, Perry described his female alter ego as “a 19th century reforming matriarch, a middle-England protester for No More Art, an aero-model-maker, or an Eastern European Freedom Fighter, a fortysomething woman living in a Barratt home, the kind of woman who eats ready meals and can just about sew on a button.”[2] Today, most of his dresses are made by his students at central Saint Martins, where he teaches a course in fashion. In 2015, along with FAT Architecture, Perry designed a holiday home in Wrabness, Essex, known as Julie’s House. Its unconventional form, inspired by follies, eccentric homes, shrines, and fairy tales was named after the local fictional character Julie May Cope. His series of tapestries made during his filming of his documentary All in the Best Possible Taste was inspired by Hogarth’s a Rake’s Progress, a tale about the young man who dissipates his inherited fortune and dies in the madhouse. Perry’s six tapestries follow the experiences of Tim Rakewell, included in his TV documentary show. Telling the story of class mobility, the artist strives to explain how social class in which we grow up influence our aesthetic taste. Mostly interested in politics of consumerism and the history of popular design, in this project, Perry processes the emotional investment people make in things they choose to live with.   Well known for major exhibitions such as the acclaimed Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman at the British Museum (2011 - 2012), in which he combined his own works with historical artefacts from the British Museum collection, Grayson Perry was the subject of an institutional tour in 2016 at Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht, and ARoS Aarhus Art Museum. The major retrospective Grayson Perry: My Pretty Little Art Career was on view at The Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney. Other projects include the permanent building A House for Essex, a collaboration with FAT Architecture situated in the North Essex countryside. The Arts Council Collection and British Council-led UK and international tour of The Vanity of Small Differences, Perry's monumental suite of tapestries, was on display at the Pera Museum, Istanbul (2015). The making of these works was chronicled in his BAFTA-winning Channel 4 series In the Best Possible Taste. The artist has received a second BAFTA for a subsequent Channel 4 series broadcast in October 2014, Grayson Perry: Who Are You? which was accompanied by a solo presentation of works on the theme of portraiture and British identity at the National Portrait Gallery, London (2014 - 2015). Perry's previous exhibitions include solo presentations at Turner Contemporary, Margate (2015); the Musée d'Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean, Luxembourg (2008); Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh (2006); Barbican Art Gallery, London (2002) and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2002). Perry has curated the exhibitions Unpopular Culture, at the de la Warr Pavilion (2008) and The Charms of Lincolnshire, The Collection, Lincoln (2006). Winner of the 2003 Turner prize, Grayson Perry was elected a Royal Academician in 2012. The following year, he received a CBE in the Queen Victoria Birthday Honors List, and in 2015 was awarded the prestigious appointments of Trustee of the British Museum and Chancellor of the University of the Arts London[3]. In 2013 Perry delivered The Reith Lectures, BBC Radio 4's annual flagship talk series by leading international thinkers, to widespread acclaim.  The artist is represented by Me Collectors Room, Berlin.   References:  ",1291
Djordje Ozbolt,"Djordje Ozbolt is a Serbian artist, currently based in London, known for historical and figurative elements in his paintings. The eclectic style seen in his work is a consequence of artist’s reckless nature and the fact that Djordje gets ideas from various, usually mutual incompatible sources. His creations represent a mix of traditional European genres like portraiture, landscape and still life, with African, Asian, Orthodox Christianity and stereotype culture. Traveling has a very important place in both personal and professional life of this painter. Without any plans and sketches, Ozbolt lets his paintings and imagination to lead him through the process of creation.   Djordje Ozbolt was born in Belgrade in 1967. From an early age, the artist got interested into art, either by reading books or by visiting the Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgrade. He used to draw a lot when he was young and still keeps a bunch of old works from Serbia and from London. As he is coming from a family of architects, he has decided to study architecture, out of laziness. In 1991, during the visit to his brother in London, he realized that he wants to study art. The beginning of the war in ex-Yugoslavia and the variety of styles that he saw in the artworks of the Young British Artists helped Djordje to make a life-changing decision. He studied at the Chelsea School of Art, and got his BA in Fine Art at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and MA in painting at the Royal Academy, in 2006.    Djordje’s paintings, sculptures, installations, and drawings are sometimes viewed as the picturesque satire of Western culture that goes deep into observer’s subconscious and reappears every now and then. The abstract narrative seen in some of his pieces is the ongoing momentum of sculptor’s imagination and inspiration, influenced by new cultures, education, and experience. Author’s opinion on the social and political situation is conveyed to his paintings in a humorous and sarcastic way, by adding Big Mac, lobster, dead birds, pig’s head, and other untypical things, with an aim to create Ozbolt’s personal aesthetic language. Exquisite technique and brushwork leave a sense of several art trends such as cubism, realism, surrealism, and primitive art. Experimental images consist of both dark and heavy colors, as well as vivid and bright shades.    Seeing different places, cultures and traditions have left a significant mark on Djordje, in the terms of his artistic works. Traveling and visiting numerous countries like India and Japan enriched his perception of art, and allowed him to incorporate a wide range of influences in his world of paint and acrylics. Ozbolt’s paintings have been displayed in solo and group exhibitions in many galleries and museums, such as the White Columns in New York, the Tate Britain, London in 2006, the Holburne Museum, Bath in 2016, and in 2012 the National Museum of Art, Osaka. In 2017 he had a solo exhibition at the Hauser & Wirth Gallery.    ",1292
Peter Zimmermann,"A contemporary abstract artist, Peter Zimmermann is best known for his blob paintings. He mainly uses programs such as Photoshop to express his unique point of view. Born in 1956 in Freiburg, Germany, Zimmermann currently lives and works in Cologne. He began his studies at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste, in Stuttgart, Germany. In 2002, Zimmermann received a professorship at Kunsthochschule fur Medien, Cologne, Germany. He has also been a guest lecturer at Universitat Luneburg in Luneberg, Germany. His works have been shown at several museums, including the Columbus Museum of Art in Columbus, OH, the Museum Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden, Germany, the Museum der Moderne Salzburg Rupertinum, in Salzburg, Germany, the Cranbrook Art Museum in Detroit, MI, the New Orleans Museum of Modern Art in New Orleans, LA, and the New York Public Library in New York, NY He initially became famous in the 1980s with his collection entitled Books Covers, but his most famous series is the Blob Paintings. Computer-generated, the artist first used found materials and abstracted them through Photoshop. The images are then transferred to canvas by means of airbrushing, and carefully applying epoxy over the image, creating an Abstract, multi-textured form. The resulting works appear as having an inner light emanating from within the Abstract form. ",1293
Lygia Clark,"Heavily influenced by Constructivism and the Bauhaus school concepts, Lygia Clark was a Brazilian geometric abstraction painter and an installation artist. She is primarily remembered for her participation in the Brazilian Constructivist movement, her innovative approach to modular sculpture and the participatory art that made her a singularly pioneering force in the world of international art. Although her creative expression varies quite a bit depending on which stage of her career you are examining, Clark was predominantly recognized for her system-based paintings and metal sculptures the viewers were invited to rearrange. Lygia also experimented with ephemeral art, finding much success with this approach as well.  In 1920, Lygia was born in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. She decided to become a full-time artist in the year of 1947 - she moved to Rio de Janeiro in order to study alongside the Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx. Between 1950 and 1952, she also studied with Isaac Dobrinsky, Fernand Léger and Arpad Szenes in Paris. In 1953, she became one of the founding members of Rio's Frente group of artists. Clark also participated in Rio de Janeiro's first National Concrete Art Exhibition, an event that will prove to be one of Clark's frequent trips to Brazil. In the first decade of her career, Clark devoted her time to painting and sculpture, constantly experimenting and testing new techniques. However, after 1966, Clark started to claim that she has abandoned the processes of making art[1], instead focusing on educating others about it.  During the time she was a teacher, Clark explored the idea of sensory perception. Suddenly, she returned to creating art - beholding her work suddenly became a multisensory experience in which the spectator became an active participant[2]. A good example of how she used to think at the time was her Nostalgia of the Body series. This project relied on participant's individual experiences occurring directly in their bodies. These pieces addressed the simultaneous existence of opposites within the same space: internal and external, metaphorical and literal, male and female. Another example of Clark's fascination with human interaction is her 1967 piece O eu e o tu (The I and the You). It consisted of two industrial rubber suits joined together by an umbilical-like cord. The participants wearing the suits would be joined together but unable to see one another, forming an almost psycho-sexual bond between them.   During the early part of Clark's career, she focused on creating small monochromatic paintings which were mostly done in black, gray and white. During the 1960s, her work became more conceptual and she used soft objects that could be manipulated by the art spectator. However, her greatest accomplishment was achieved when Clark co-founded the Neo-Concrete movement[3], which was joined by a fellow Brazilian Hélio Oiticica. The Neo-Concretists were interested in how an artwork could be manipulated by the spectator and how art could be used to express complex human realities - interests that naturally placed Clark in the midst of the movement's conceptual core. Throughout her career, Clark's work has involved an exploration of art's effect on spectators. It should be noted that one of her primary goals was to appeal to the average, everyday person, not just to focus on the bourgeois crowd.   Lygia garnered much attention and recognition from the art community due to her roles in effectuating contemporary avant-garde ideas. However, between 1979 and 1988, Clark moved more toward art therapy than actually creating new works. She began using her art to treat psychotic and mildly disturbed patients. Experimentations did not always result in the way Lygia expected them to, but the effects of this unorthodox method were often astonishing. Clark returned to Rio de Janeiro in 1977. Her later works were more abstract and holistic with a focus on psychotherapy and healing[4], obviously heavily influenced by the experiences she had with psychotic and neurotic patients. In 1988, she died of a heart attack in her home.   We do everything so automatically that we have forgotten the poignancy of smell, of physical anguish, of tactile sensations of all kinds. This interesting statement made by Clark herself offers a perfect insight into how her creative mindset worked - Clark endeavored to involve the viewer in her works in an unprecedented psychological and physical way. And by doing so, she was creating multisensory experiences for her audience that are arguably still unrivaled by any similar creative body of works to this day. In return, Clark is now remembered as a true artistic innovator who had a strong impact on various historical movements and as someone who successfully sought to redefine the relationship between art and society. This artist is represented by Alison Jacques Gallery London. References:   ",1294
Rick Begneaud,"Rick Begneaud is an American mixed-media artist, whose art is recognized for his use of found objects – scraps of materials and fabrics, which Rick gathers during his travels across the globe.  Raised in the Cajun country, Rick Begneaud graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. His uncle was a famous American painter and graphic artist, Robert Rauschenberg. Inventive, playful and original, Rauschenberg’s art predicted the pop art movement, with works such as Combines series made in the 1950s, in which he merged non-traditional materials and objects into an innovative combinations. As a nephew of the famous artist, Rick Begneaud spent summers on the Captiva Island, near Florida, in the company of Rauschenberg’s friends such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. Surrounded by such names of the art world, Begneaud soon wondered to his own artistic journey, and started making his art. As a studio assistant and sidekick to the legendary Robert Rauschenberg, Rick traveled extensively with him and toured the globe from China to Mexico. In such environment, Begneaud love for travels grew, and never faded or left him. As an artist, Rauschenberg was a great influence and a source of inspiration in Begneaud’s own artworks.  The oeuvre of Rick Begneaud is born of place and experience. Rick uses his extensive travels through Africa, Asia, South America, Europe and the United States as a source of inspiration. His growing career is nourished by these travels, during which he collects textiles and small elements from remote villages throughout the world and embodies these places from a different perspective. As an avid traveler, Rick’s oeuvre of abstract works conveys life’s circumstances into exciting visual signs, preserving the spirit and breathing new life into these found objects. Begneaud first started using and collecting scraps of fabric after his journey to West Africa, where he was fascinated by discarded, beautiful, sun-faded pieces of clothes and materials laying around on the floor. Such approach to his art provides the artist an intimacy that bonds him to an undiscovered space, morphing his unique view on places he visited into new creations.  Rick’s work deals with implied histories and emotional applications of found elements, abstract painting, and collage on paper or canvas. Unwitting forms and patterns, along with the fabrics create abstracted, angular shapes pulsating with rich color. The artist favors a palette that combines pastels with earth tones, creating an atmospheric and harmonious feeling of his works. Although the sense of spontaneity is noticeable in Begneaud’s art, the compositions of his pieces are well-balanced and thought out. Rick uses and appropriates gathered textiles as rectangular shapes, mounting them onto the canvas and combining them with painted accents, such as red color dots, or with elements of timeworn photographs and clips from old newspapers. Over the past 30 years, Rick has evolved into a prominent member of the San Francisco Bay Area bustling artist community. Rick Begneaud lives in California, where he works out of his studio in Sausalito. WIDEWALLSRICK BEGNEAUD by WIDEWALLSFollow On   ",1295
Francisco Toledo,"Fame and recognition had come too late for many artists in history, many died while still misunderstood, just so their work could finally be accepted years, even decades after their deaths. But, Francisco Toledo luckily became a symbol and expression of the deepest myths of Mexico during his lifetime. This multi talented artist painted and made sculptures, but arguably was most famous for his graphic artworks. His experience was enriched by his traveling to Europe in the 60’s when he crossbred artistic traditions of the Western Europe with the ones of his home state of Oaxaca, and Mexico in general. He didn’t stop there and his work continued to evolve into something that became an inspiration for many other artists, raising Toledo’s status all the way to the stars, where he undeniably belonged.   Francisco Toledo was born to Zapotec parents in 1940 in Minatitlan, Oaxaca. From an early age, Toledo had demonstrated his ability to draw, and his father encouraged his son to accept the colors by painting the walls of their house. His grandfather Benjamin took Toledo to country trips, telling popular stories of fantastic creatures along the way, thus increasing young artist’s imagination and inspiration. Francisco attended the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Oaxaca and the Centro Superior de Artes Aplicadas del Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, where he studied graphic arts with Guillermo Silva Santamaria. Sometimes the whole family could be gifted in artistic ways, and Toledo’s certainly is, as his daughter Natalia writes poetry, and his other children, Laureana Toledo and Dr Lakra are artists, like their father.   In the early 1960s, Toledo traveled throughout Europe and eventually settled in Paris, France. Soon, he set himself up in the workshop of artist Stanley William Hayter. In 1965, Toledo returned to his home country and began using what he had learned in Europe to create a new style of Mexican Art. Shortly after, he had been recognized in Europe as a singular artist and celebrated by art critics for his ""development of the mythic"" and ""his sacred sense of life."" He came home with a refined pictorial technique that would not stop enriching, as well as the influence of ideas of artists from different European schools such as Dürer, Paul Klee and Marc Chagall. But in reality, his greatest influence came from the codices collected pre-Hispanic symbols with all its rabidly contemporary forms. Toledo truly is a modern and illustrious painter of codices, a shaman willing to purify the spirit to return the enjoyment to the body. Settling in Oaxaca after the return from Europe, he produced paintings and stone, wood, and wax sculptures, as well as graphics. As a medium, graphics particularly intrigued him from early in his career because of the extraordinary range of effects available through printing and etching. Major exhibitions followed, and in 1973, he had a show in the Carl Finkler Gallery in Paris, and, in 1975, he had a show at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. By 1980, his work was extensive enough for the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City to hold a retrospective.   Toledo's art is concerned with the cultural traditions of his birthplace, the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The myths, people, flora, and fauna of the state play major roles in many of his works. Anthropomorphized creatures and metamorphosed objects are a persistent aspect of his oeuvre. He illustrated numerous books based on the ancestral stories of his people. These books include Chilam Balam, Guachi, and Sahagún. Pieces such as Chivo and Shoe and Toads  show Toledo's use of Oaxaca and animals. He also created a series of 15 prints inspired by Franz Kafka's Report For an Academy. Toledo spent much of his life promoting the arts in Oaxaca. In 1988, Toledo’s social and cultural concerns about his home state led to his participation in the establishment of an art library at the Instituto de Artes Gráficas de Oaxaca (IAGO), which currently holds roughly 12,000 books dealing with numerous art forms and Mexican Art. He also founded the Museum de Arte Contemporaneo de Oaxaca (MACO), the Patronato Pro-Defensa y Conservación del Patrimonio Cultural de Oaxaca, a library for the blind, a photographic center, and the Eduardo Mata Music Library. Francisco Toledo had exhibitions in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Japan, Sweden, the United States, as well as other countries. His work is represented in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Museo Tamayo in Mexico City.   Toledo did all he could to preserve the heritage of his home state of Oaxaca, and the whole Mexico. He is considered as one of the most prominent artist in his country, whose skills make his artworks vibrate as they strive for real life. Symbolically, they also represent the desire and the need of the Mexican people to save their traditions in this globalized world, where the drive for total destruction is ever-present. In those conditions, he stood up and gave his best at trying to keep all the beautiful traditions of his people alive. Francisco Toledo died in 2019 at the age of 79. He lived and worked in Oaxaca, Mexico.  ",1296

Stefan Thiel,"Stefan Thiel is a German artist who uses a binary system in his works: he transfers photographs into silhouettes. The harsh black and white contrasts in his pictures lead to an intensified precision as well as to an aestheticism of the portrayed. Thiel is born in 1965 in Berlin, where he still lives and works. He exhibited his work throughout Germany, Switzerland, Australia and elsewhere, including venues such as widmertheodoridis in Eschlikon, Hamburger Kunsthalle in Hamburg, Kunstverein Freiburg, Germany, Kunstmuseum, Solothurn, Switzerland, Mai 36 Galerie in Zurich and Galerie nächst St. Stephan - Rosemarie Schwarzwälder in Vienna. His work is in two museum collections, at ALTANA Kulturstiftung im Sinclair-Haus in Bad Homburg and Burger Collection in Hong Kong. Rendering photorealistic images with stunning precision, Thiel's cut-outs each integrate the ""photographic, the performative, the graphical and the decorative."" He uses a scalpel and an elaborate process to cut out delicate visual objects depicting people, everyday scenes, architecture, and landscapes from his own photographs and drawings as well as famous films. His practice evokes the Cubist desire to deconstruct traditional still lifes by way of collage.",1298

Olafur Eliasson,"There are a number of goals anyone’s art may be aimed to fulfill - from existing just for the sake of it to sharing one’s ideas and beliefs with the world. Some see the possibility of art to influence a wide audience, making artwork that is both alluring in its form as well as averting attention to an array of universal problems or thoughts. Working with a purpose of turning thinking into doing, the art of Olafur Eliasson is at the same time relevant to the individual and the public, as well as concerning the environment and its safety. Enhancing the experience of the viewers with natural elements like light, water, fog, and air temperature, Eliasson averts the attention to some of the environmental and spatial concerns.  Having received his degree from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1995, Olafur Eliasson has been developing an artistic oeuvre highly broad in its form and field of work. The artist is known to work with experts in various fields in order to complete his projects, engaging architects, theorists, engineers, and craftsmen, among others. He had also started a studio following his college days, one that employs over 30 people working in various fields in order to assist constructing Eliasson’s sculptures, installations, and large-scale projects. His works are often intractable and the viewers get to experience natural elements in conjunction with the technical parts of the installations; Din blinde passager (Your blind passenger) (2010) is a 90 meter long tunnel in which the fog affects and limits the senses, whereas 360 degrees Room For All Colours (2002) uses light to alter the perception of the viewers.    Many of Eliasson’s works can be found out in the open, outside of the confines of the gallery and museum walls. Averting the attention towards and invoking reflection on the surrounding environment, he has created some monumental artwork around the globe. One of his famous projects Green River included pouring a nontoxic powder into the rivers of Moss (Norway), Los Angeles, Bremen, Tokyo, and Stockholm, dyeing the waters in green which in turn drew the looks if the city’s inhabitants, reminding them of its fluidity. Another well known public project is The New York City Waterfalls that claimed the title of the most expensive public art project ever since The Gates installation in Central Park.   For raising the attention towards the issues of the environment as well as having a significant impact on the viewers with his artwork, Olafur Eliasson has been greatly recognized and awarded for his work; The Spiral Pavilion had brought him the Benesse Prize by the Benesse Corporation; the Nykredit Architecture Prize and the Eckersberg Medal for painting as well as the Prince Eugen Medal for sculpture are just some of his many esteemed awards. In 2014, he became an artist in residence at MIT, given the privilege of studying and teaching in the institution for a period of time. Eliasson’s influence can be seen in the fact that the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, had visited his studio in Berlin during a state visit to Germany in 2013.   With an artistic practice that spans over several different fields, Olafur Eliasson merges knowledge, awareness, and art. Immersing the viewers into a realm of natural elements, his interactive works reach out to your senses as an individual while raising your attention towards universal, public issues. More than simply decorating the world with his truly stunning pieces, Eliasson and his portfolio bear the weight of responsibility that is shared with all those able to witness his work - the ones inhabiting the environments that we should hope to preserve.

Marcel Broodthaers,"One of the most talented individuals his nation has in its modern art history, Marcel Broodthaers was a Belgian artist whose pieces were created from an incredibly vast set of skills that allowed the author to use various mediums and techniques with ease. He produced paintings, prints, sculptures, poems and films on regular basis, oftentimes tackling hard political topics or critiquing art institutions he saw as useless establishments. Right from the very start of his career, Broodthaers approached visual art with a somewhat sarcastic and rebellious attitude[1], originally treating it as a kind of ironic, comical venture that was well primarily suited with his sense of humor. This feature never truly left Marcel's artistic vocabulary as he remained a playful author for the entirety of his relatively short twelve-year career. In its conceptual core, Broodthaers’ practice is based on the ideas of re-appropriation and re-presentation of other artists’ practices. Full of parody, metonymy and redundancy, his work is playfully cerebral.  Marcel Broodthaers was born in Brussels, Belgium, and it is here that he spent most of his life. He was associated with the Groupe Surréaliste-revolutionnaire from the year of 1945 onwards and dabbled in journalism, film and poetry on a consistent basis. However, none of these fields was able to satisfy him for too long as he enjoyed experimenting with new things regularly. Writing poems was one of the rare things he never stopped doing. Broodthaers spent almost twenty years of his life living in poverty as a struggling poet who took comfort in the fact he was doing something he loved. However, in the year of 1963, Marcel decided to become a visual artist and began to make objects. In order to somehow mark this decision, the artist performed the symbolic act of embedding fifty unsold copies of his book of poems in plaster[2]. This was his first piece of art. In 1964, Broodthaers wrote the following statement in the catalog of his first official exhibition: I, too, wondered whether I could not sell something and succeed in life. For some time I had been no good at anything. I am forty years old... Finally, the idea of inventing something insincere finally crossed my mind and I set to work straightaway. At the end of three months, I showed what I had produced to Philippe Edouard Toussaint, the owner of the Galerie St Laurent. 'But it is art' he said 'and I will willingly exhibit all of it.' 'Agreed' I replied.   In 1957, Broodthaers made his first film and would continue to direct over 50 short movies in documentary, narrative and experimental styles for the next few years. As for his more conventional visual artworks, the author worked principally with assemblies of found objects and collage that contained written texts. These narrative segments of his art were actually more important to Marcel than all the other materials combined. Broodthaers used ludicrous materials such as shells of eggs and mussels on a regular basis[3], combining these with broken furniture, garden tools, household gadgets and reproductions of other people's artworks. Some of his most notable pieces from this period were the Visual Tower (1966) and Surface of mussels (1966). Most of his conceptual decisions were guided by the ideas of his idol with whom he shared a first name, the avant-garde legend Marcel Duchamp. For Broodthaers, Duchamp was the greatest artist to have ever lived and he held everything the American said about art close to heart.   Between the years of 1968 and 1975, Marcel Broodthaers produced many large-scale environmental pieces that reinterpreted the very notion of what a museum should be[4]. His most noted piece of this kind was an installation which initially began in his Brussels house which he called Musée d'Art Moderne, Départment des Aigles (1968). This masterpiece was followed by a further eleven manifestations of what their author believed genuine museums should look like. The entire collection of works was supposed to be symbolically sold in 1971 on account of bankruptcy, but there were no buyers interested in what Marcel was selling. However, Broodthaers continued to experiment with these large-scale environmental pieces, not allowing anything to discourage him[5]. In 1975, he presented the exhibition L’Angelus de Daumier at the Centre National d’Art Contemporain in Paris. It featured many different rooms where each was called by a single color. The author himself explained the idea behind the piece with the following statement: The influence of language on perceptions of the world and the ways museums affect the production and consumption of art. Marcel's mature works aimed at critiquing the interrelationships between artworks, the artist and the museum, something that Broodthaers desperately wanted to fix.[6] In 1969, Marcel started to sporadically live in Düsseldorf, Berlin and London. He died from complications following a liver disease on his 52nd birthday. Broodthaers is buried at Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels under a tombstone of his own design.   Although his loose approach to art making and the fact he usually used other authors' works in his own creations does affect his ultimate legacy, the influence of Marcel Broodthaers is still as strong today as the case was at the time he appeared on the scene[7]. By adopting and representing aspects of his contemporary movements such as Pop Art and Conceptual art, Broodthaers managed to remain relevant in his own time whilst he was also combining genres and concepts for his own artistic objectives, working on his sole legacy. Ultimately, due to the fact Marcel spent so much of his time outside of the art world and all its norms, this Belgian artist was able to provide the viewers and art historians with a unique perspective of how pieces of art are colonized by either an elite, by the state or by commercial organizations. His perspective was uncompromised, pure and, therefore, precious to all of us who investigate it from a today's standpoint. References:   ",1301

Rirkrit Tiravanija,"New York-based Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija is a pioneer of the Relational Aesthetics movement, best known for his intimate installations that allow people to socialize, share meals, read, play music, or cook. These shared communal traditions mark the artist's shift from conventional art objects towered more social aspects of art, inviting people from all walks of life to experience and inhabit the spaces he constructs.  The artist has exhibited in various institutions around the world, including the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, the Serpentine Galleries, the National Gallery Singapore, and the Stedelijk Museum. Tiravanija has also showcased his work at the São Paulo Bienal, the Venice Biennale, and the Whitney Biennial.   Rirkrit Tiravanija was born in 1961 in Buenos Aires to Thai parents. However, his parents traveled extensively, so he grew up in Canada, Thailand, and Ethiopia. After history studies at Carleton University, he attended several schools, such as Ontario College of Art in Toronto, the Banff Center School of Fine Arts, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Whitney Independent Studies Program in New York. During the 1990s, Tiravanija started exploring the concepts of identity, inspired by his personal story. The work he produced during this time often addressed political and social concerns, such as the protest against the Thai government. One of his well-known works was a series of performances titled Untitled (1992), during which he would invite the audience to participate in the preparation of the traditional Thai meal - Pad thai.   Rirkrit Tiravanija has collaborated with several renowned artists, including Philippe Parreno, Pierre Huyghe, and Liam Gillick. In recent years he has participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions tackling social and political themes. The Land project was done to put in the spotlight the problem of much-needed environmental recoveries in Thailand, such as food production and removable energy. In 2020 the artist had a solo exhibition titled Fear Eats the Soul at Glenstone, Maryland, comprised of a T-shirt workshop and a soup kitchen. Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow, and Green exhibition in 2019 at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC, transformed the exhibition spaces into dining spaces where visitors were served curry. The artist, throughout his career, has attempted to undermine and demolish the cultural and social boundaries of art.   For over 30 decades, Rirkrit Tiravanija has created numerous installations incorporating a variety of media, such as printmaking, video, painting, photography, music, and mixed-media assemblage. The artist made two films, Chew the Fat (2008) shown at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, and Lung Neaw Visits His Neighbors (2011) shown at the 68th Venice International Film Festival.  Currently, Tiravanija holds the position of Professor of Professional Practice in Visual Arts at Columbia University. He is a recipient of numerous awards, including the Hugo Boss Prize from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (2004) and the National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artist Fellowship (1994) Rirkrit Tiravanija lives and works in Chiang Mai New York, and Berlin. ",1306

Eddie Peake,"Eddie Peake’s varied artistic vocabulary encompasses performance, video, photography, painting, sculpture and installation. Peake's main focus lies in the lapses and voids inherent in the process of translating between verbal language and nonverbal modes of communication. It is in the discrepancy between words and any other language, say, images, emotions, bodily movements or sounds, that his art is located. Peake’s work is an often-energetic spectacle in which the absurd and the erotic each find a place, and in which the artist plays a central role. While studying at the Royal Academy, Peake staged a naked five-a-side football match in Burlington Gardens where the two teams were differentiated only by their socks and trainers. As the work's title suggests, Touch (2012) addressed the inherent tactility and homoerotic exhibitionism that comes with contact sports. For Peake, the work was ""a joyous event"", but one that quickly became commonplace as the audience were habituated to the nudity of the players. Peake went on to develop his choreographed performances in which body, sound and gesture were employed to dramatic effect in the work titled Amidst A Sea Of Flailing High Heels And Cooking Utensils (2012), a performance devised in two parts for the Tanks at Tate Modern and for the Chisenhale Gallery, London. Pursuing his exploration of the body’s potential as a sculptural and an erotic object, Peake asks the viewer to examine their own responses to the piece; how the language of music and movement are affecting their perception of what is taking place, and how they are implicated as voyeurs of this erotic spectacle. In DEM at Cell Project Space and Infinite Disparity, the ongoing performance within his inaugural exhibition at White Cube Bermondsey, Peake investigated the possibilities of performance within an exhibition structure. In DEM, audiences encountered an invigilator wearing a tiger’s costume, while at White Cube a male roller-skater wearing a sheer knitted jumpsuit glided languidly around the installation and viewers, pausing to commune with the other works. At White Cube, Peake experimented for the first time with devising a performance through public rehearsals in the gallery space over the duration of the show, explaining: ""I want to focus on the process of devising a dramatic performance work, and the constant and jolting shift between reality and drama implicit in trying to do that in the context of an art gallery."" In Peake’s acid-coloured spray paintings, sharp-lettered slogans created with masking tape emerge through layers of spray paint to reveal the work’s polished steel ground, mirroring the viewer. The words and images shaped from negative space are a metaphor for gaps in language – and it is in this space that the viewer finds themselves. This fascination with the 'in-between' or gaps in language comprehension is as much an important aspect of Peake’s practice as is body politics. The themes meet in his series of poster and panel compositions, which contrast black and white photographs of nude figures with vibrant panels spelling out tag lines that teasingly enhance the work’s erotic subject matter. The intimation of tactility is also visible in Peake’s Handschmeichler, (or ‘pleasing to the hand’) sculptures, combining highly polished and hand-crafted amorphous plaster blobs with concrete architectonic structures; biomorphic forms caressed by the surface of a hard edged abstract monolith. By playing with the ambiguities of sexuality and gender categorisation, Peake’s work conveys the fluid boundaries of identity. The artist expanded this investigation via the introduction of a new persona – a powerful faun as seen in his neon sculpture The Baddest Badman (2013) – an alter-ego who will recur and evolve throughout his work. Born in London in 1981, Eddie Peake has lived in Jerusalem, Rome and London. Having graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art in 2006, he undertook a residency at the British School at Rome from 2008 to 2009, and in 2013 graduated with a Master’s degree from the Royal Academy Schools, London. Recent performance projects include The David Roberts Art Foundation (2012), The Tanks, Tate Modern in conjunction with the Chisenhale Gallery (2012); The Royal Academy of Arts (2012) Cell Project Space (2012) and Performa 13 (2013).",1308

Richard Hambleton,"The context and the roots of street art are much clearer when the work of Richard Hambleton comes in sight despite the fact the artist himself categorized his production as public art. The way he articulated his personal urban experience was always a direct reaction to the existing situation, so his works provide a refined insight in social and political shifts of the times. Therefore, the whole artistic practice of Richard Hambleton, a godfather of street art, as he was called very often, is considered as conceptual one.  Richard Hambleton was born in 1952 is in Vancouver, Canada. He earned Bachelor in Fine Arts degree at the Emily Carr School of Art in Vancouver 1975. Hambleton was Founder and Co-Director of Pumps Center for Alternative Art, which was an art gallery, performance, and video space, and shortly after went on to graduate from the San Francisco Institute of Art in San Francisco. He was the member of a group, together with Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, coming out of the New York City art scene during the booming art market of the 1980s.   Quite early Hambleton decided to expose his works on the street walls as opposed to exhibiting them in galleries, despite the fact that such an artistic expression was already present in public spaces long before. Nevertheless, his name came to prominence in between 1976 to 1978 when he was releasing fictitious murder scenes by painting with a police chalk outline around bodies of volunteer homicide victims. The works titled Image Mass Murder were splashed with red paint on the outline, leaving behind a realistic looking crime scene. These paintings were done on the streets of 15 major cities across the United States and Canada, and would often have the effect of startling or shocking passersby.    The artist's reputation grew and he was even described as a Psychic Terrorist and a Sick Jokester by the press. In 1979, Hambleton moved to New York and started working on a new project called Shadowman. Those works depicted a life-sized silhouetted image of some mysterious person and were splashed and brushed with black paint in an authentic manner. Located on hundreds of buildings and other structures across New York City, Shadowman series were usually painted in dark allies or lurking just around a street corner. The project was later extended to other cities, including Paris, London, and Rome.   The apparent fascination with mystery was later upgraded, so the shadow entity was no longer a completely displaced character, it had become a riding figure, a cowboy or the Marlboro Man. Under that title, Richard Hambleton painted the series on canvas and other materials, so they can be displayed in a gallery space. He was inspired by the Marlboro (cigarette) advertisements and created a composition with a ghostly figure often followed by the Marlboro lettering font. Those works possess at the same time sensibility typical of New York New and No Wave scene of times as well as the reference to Pop Art. In 1983, fashion icons Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood collaborated with Hambleton to create a Shadowman jersey skirt.   Similar to his before mentioned peers Basquiat and Haring, Hambleton let himself go the charms of decadence. The drug culture took him over, so he practically disappeared from the art world. Nevertheless, in retrospect, the artist showed the body of work which he had produced regardless of addiction and decay. It was a series of quieter landscapes titled Beautiful Paintings, which differed much from his black and white style. Namely, he used transparent paint on a metallic leaf background in order to reflect light and color and according to the artist's words a reaction against the abundance of figurative paintings displayed in galleries at the time.   The works of this established artist have been shown internationally and can be found in major museums and private collections. In addition to his international success is the fact that in 1984, he has released 17 life-size figures on the East side of the Berlin Wall, returning a year later to paint more figures on the West side of the Berlin Wall. Hambleton’s rise to success in the New York art scene, as well as his widely reported struggle with drug addiction, became a central story of the film Shadowman which was directed by Oren Jacoby. Although Richard Hambleton became best known as a conceptual artist and was one of the founding figures of the Lower East Side art movement in New York City, he continued producing fresh, inviting and inspiring artworks until his death on October 29th, 2017 at the age of 65.

LA II,"Considered as one of the most recognizable graffiti artists from the Lower East Side in the 80’s, LA II is also known as LA2, LA Rock, Little Angel or by his real name, Angel Ortiz. Beginning his career as a 13 years old boy, of the crucial importance was his acquaintance with Keith Haring with whom he collaborated on a number of projects. This six years long partnership out of Haring’s decade-long career, had a great influence on the work of both artists, although the older Haring took most of the credits leaving the LA II in the shadow.   Leaving his High School, LA II travelled around the world working with Haring. His role in the artistic development of his famous companion is marked with peculiarity and original look of their co-produced works. He was for Haring what Jean-Michel Basquiat had been for Andy Warhol. Their partnership was mutually complementary which is evident in the patterns, the consistency of line, the spacing, but also in the technique. These two artists produced hundreds of valuable works, which were exhibited and sold from New York to Tokyo and Europe. Interlacing their styles, LA II complemented Haring’s “empty spaces”. Covering the surfaces of different common objects, they transformed them into the art pieces. Using the Day-Glo paint, they covered sculptures and real things, making installations with graffiti inscriptions with the mixture of contemporary and ancient symbols.     The collaboration between Haring and LA II seems like the relationship that Picasso has had with Braque, except that LA II did not get the recognition he deserved. After Haring’s death, his foundation took over the care of his works, including the ones he produced with LA II. Constantly avoided by the art world, LA II’ s work is featured in museums collections and privately held without attribution. His images are used for commercial purpose often out of his knowledge. His tags LA II or La Rock are seen on many pieces that are attributed to Haring only.     LA II’a collaborative nature connected him with many prominent artistic names, as Richard Hamilton and street artists like Delta 2, Ero, LES or Cindy Shaoul. His influence over Keith Haring developed by integration of two creative spirits produced some of the most notable works of art that exist in the art market. After the end of Haring/LA II collaboration, LA II started his fight for recognition, creating his own impressive pieces in his distinctive style. His name was in the focus of a scandal in 2008 when he was caught tagging his name in a restored Haring’s mural. It seems that LA II suffered injustice and that critics and public overlooked his important role in Keith Haring’s body of work. LA II is represented by Woodward Gallery, New York and Galerie Brugier-Rigail, Paris.  ",1317

Duncan, who was credited as the inventor of modern dance, captured Abraham’s attention soon afterwards, when he saw her dance dressed in free-flowing costumes with her hair loose and her feet bare. The artist was captivated by her naturalism and her sense of rhythm.  This encounter marked the beginning of a relationship spanning the next three decades in which Walkowitz made a series of more than 5,000 drawings of the famous dancer. Duncan is credited with launching modern dance at the same time that visual artists on both sides of the Atlantic were seeking new directions.  Upon his return to New York, Walkowitz became associated with other artist and joined photographer Alfred Stieglitz’s avant-garde 291 Gallery. Originally named the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, the 291 Gallery was a place where the forerunners of modern art in America gathered.   He was a part of the ground-breaking 1913 Armory Show, and his works have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art - MOMA in New York and many galleries, art venues and museums internationally. His works are now represented by Puccio Fine Art.  All images copyright © the artist",1321
Mark Powell,"British artist Mark Powell is best known for his portraits drawn on canvases made of old envelopes, maps, and postcards, giving his work a sense of timelessness. Dazzling and intricately sketches made with his favorite tool, a Biro pen, feature animals, objects, and portraits of people. The unique canvases often retain the original post stamps and marks, which help preserve a bit of history and the story behind the owners and senders. The artist's subjects are unknown older characters, drawn with unerring precision where every wrinkle and a line tells a deeply personal story of a life. Some of Powell's work possesses an undercurrent of social commentary, for example, in American Tourists (2020), where a portrait of a Native American is drawn on a map of Manhattan. Born in 1980, Mark Powell does not remember a time he did not draw. His entry into university happened purely by chance, as he wandered in one day and struck up a conversation with the head of the Fine Art Drawing and Painting Department of Huddersfield University. When he graduated in 2006, it was a struggle to make ends meet. After a feature about Powell appeared on the culture website Colossal, his career truly started, as he could finally fully concentrate on his art and not worry about surviving as all his art was sold overnight.   Yet it was during these turbulent years that Powell, due to lack of funding, was forced to start drawing on smaller canvases. The artist found an envelope belonging to a World War I soldier sent just as they were 'going over the top.' The 'upcycle' of pairing an elderly face with an antique document for Powell is a preservation of a piece of history. Powell is inspired by art that makes you stop and linger, such as works by Richard Hamilton, Jean Michel Basquiat, Samuel Bassett, David Hockney, and Antony Micallef. The people in the portraits are unknown to the artist, as he wishes to keep the mystery. He chooses his subjects based on purely aesthetic values and couples them with the right ""canvas,"" which can take some time as he waits for the right pairing. The perfect balance of a face and historical background is like a dance where both partners work perfectly together. However, he does not have sitters, as the process of drawing takes too long for one person to sit still. Once he finds a perfect face, he takes a photo and is ready to begin. The artist is especially drawn to the risky side of drawing on old documents. Powell explained: Powell goes looking for historical documents in markets and bookshops. Over the years, he found that Paris is the richest source of materials. Mark Powell lives and works in London. ",1322
Arturo Di Modica,"One of the most important elements of art, one that can be said to be the key factor for creating legendary names throughout history, is the freedom to express one’s ideas. Although obviously following certain norms, techniques, and styles, it’s the individual way of thinking and seeing art as a unique pattern that makes one artist stand out next to the other. Not afraid to follow his own path, Arturo Di Modica was an Italian-born artist who built a great name amongst the legends of artistic present and past. Proud of his Italian heritage, he received great acclaim for his sculptural work during the long career, and with his yet fiery passion for sculpting, his oeuvre seemed far from finished.   Arturo Di Modica is hailed as one of the greatest sculptors in the modern era, and most definitely one of the greatest ones alive; but even the road of a thousand miles has its first step, and Di Modica’s path of wide recognition started out as humble. Born on January 26th, 1941, the Sicilian boy was quickly drawn by the artistic practice as a way of expression, and he knew even then that sculpture is his one true calling. As young as 19, Di Modica left the island to pursue his desire to create sculptures, finding home in the city of Florence which was filled with great artistic minds, providing a nourishing surrounding for the young sculptor. Forming a practice around bronze in Florence, while utilizing marble from the city of Carrara known for the quality of it,  his devotion and attention to details came into the spotlight of the artistic scene in Italy as the path of success quickly unveiled before him.   Creating many masterful pieces during his 12 years in Florence and Carrara, Arturo Di Modica made yet another step towards finding the truth through art, and led by his independent artistic spirit he had moved to the United States in 1973. Settling in New York which served as his resident town, he had opened his first American studio in SoHo neighborhood. Maintaining the quality and an astonishing attention to details in his pieces, Di Modica’s abstract sculptures and animal portrayals brought him even greater recognition. His work was widely exhibited and collected even then, and yet, the ones that he considers to be his greatest achievements are the ones built for the public eye; four, in particular, made up of the marble sculptures he exhibited at the Rockefeller Center in 1977, the works in bronze shown the same year at Castle Clinton, as well as the bronze horse Cavallo exhibited in Lincoln Center. During his life in New York he made some monumental pieces, and while he was very proud of his Italian heritage, he claimed a great love and respect for the life in the United States, as well as its people.   His free spirit merged with his delicate sculptural practice on one more occasion, producing a piece by which he is widely known. The Charging Bull, a three and a half ton bronze statue of a bull in motion represents all of the trademarks of Di Modica’s artistic expression: meticulously capturing a moving animal with a remarkable attention to details, displaying a tremendous skill of working with bronze. The sculpture was initially placed in front of the New York Stock Exchange, and if you’re thinking that you might need a permit to place a figure of this size and weight in such a busy place, you’re absolutely right. Installing it as a Christmas gift to the people of New York in December of 1989, Di Modica had placed his sculpture without a permit and it was thus removed. With the help of the citizens that admired the sculpture while it was on display, the piece was repositioned and it stands to this day in Bowling Green Park in the Financial District in Manhattan. One of the most famous sculptures worldwide, it has become a symbol of Wall Street and the Financial District, as well as financial prosperity and optimism.   Through dedication, passion, discipline, and an inborn desire to create art, Arturo Di Modica’s rich portfolio made him a legend in the world of art. Presenting more than just the aesthetic form, his detailed sculptures are considered to bring good fortune and luck, invoking prosperity and success to those that surround them. With his artistic career spanning over five decades, Di Modica made a full circle and went back to Sicily to work and be with his family. One of his last big projects: a stunning sculpture over 46 feet wide and 28 feet high made out of bronze and steel, the Wild Horses will weigh about 14 tons.  Arturo Di Modica died in 2021 at the age of 80.

Gao Weigang,"An artist of diverse practices, Gao Weigang is a Chinese author who produces paintings, installations, sculptures and performance works. His usual vocabulary is consisted of industrial raw materials, reflecting on materialization and its nature of communication. Born in 1976 in Heilongjiang Province, China, Weigang lives and works in Beijing, China. His work has been exhibited widely, including Espace Louis Vuitton, Singapore, Shanghai Gallery of Art, Shanghai, Platform China, Beijing, Taikang Space, Beijing, and CAAW, Beijing. Bringing elements such as light, sound and text into his work to link disparate forms and narratives, the artist's practice nods to Contemporary Constructivism. Mostly focusing on site-specific works, he toys with the boundaries between subjective and objective engagement. Each of his pieces work both as the apparatus and the product of experiment He often uses the tension between material and surface, and between two and three-dimensional space, challenging the viewer’s accustomed visual culture with a sense of humor and an overriding hint of skepticism. His famous bodies of work include the Interior View series, where he painted cold interior environments that appear to depict technological control centers and suggest utopian visions for the future, and Superstition, where he presented fake archaeological remains in the form of various geometric marble blocks.

Sara Pittman,"Colorful abstract artworks by Sara Pittman rely heavily on intuition and spontaneity. Her pieces are marked with thin layers of paint brought together to reveal an array of stories about people and nature. Through an array of colorful patches and carefully aligned blank spaces, created with a mixture of bold and calming brushstrokes the artist seeks to create a balance in her abstract work so characteristic of the nature she likes to paint the most.   Sara Pittman grew up in an artistic family in Montgomery, USA. Her mother and grandfather both had artistic careers, so the artist fell in love with art early on in her life. Sara Pittman started to paint as a child and received a lot of support from her parents which encouraged her to decide on the artistic career in adulthood. The artist studied fine arts at Huntingdon College, where she received her Bachelor degree in May 2015. In 2016 she was accepted into Redux Contemporary Art Center in Charleston, USA which caused her to move from her native Alabama to South Carolina.    Intuition and raw emotions are the key guidelines of Sara Pittman's artistic process. Her process is quite unpredictable as the artist always relies on spontaneity to lead the way. She paints in transparent layers of paint creating her world and telling a story with each new layer. She mixed bright colors with muted tones and combines loose and controlled movement to create a sense of balance in her work. Sara Pittman uses oil and acrylic paint as she feels that these media provide higher freedom for exploration. Conspicuous patches of paint are depicted in contact with pockets of negative space to evoke the feeling of travel through a distant world. By employing simple yet effective color palette young American painter is capable of creating an array of environments, whether it's a wast forest or an abandoned path at dawn.   Nature and natural light represent recurrent motifs in Sara Pittman's imagery, noticeable in many titles of her work including Dawning, Be the Light and Woodland. Alongside her abstract work the artist is known to create unique sculptures by painting on deer and longhorn skulls, to convey the notion of almost tribal spirituality. By painting a design that's simultaneously sharp and fragile Sara Pittman creates pieces that resemble both geometric and tribal patterns. Her skull artworks represent a totally different approach for the artist who tends to move away from the gestural movement of her abstract work to create something controlled and precise. Sara Pittman is represented by Matthew Rachman Gallery.  Featured image : Sara Pittman - Portrait Images courtesy of Matthew Rachman Gallery.",1328

John Ferren,"An abstract American artist, John Ferren was influenced by both Wassily Kandinsky and Zen Buddhism. His works feature floating forms within backdrops of flat color, alluding to architecture, still life, and landscape, while still remaining vague. Born in Pendleton, Oregon in 1905, Ferren was an art school student in San Francisco for a short time. By the mid-1920s he was already producing portrait busts, and later in early 1930s, he was attending the Académie Ranson, and the Sorbonne, Académie de la Grande Chaumiere. Although for the most part not formally educated, he said that during his visits to Europe he “literally learned art around the café tables in Paris, knowing other artists and talking.” He was developing his practice through an adventurous lifestyle, and interaction with other artists. In Paris, he associated himself with artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Hans Hofmann, Joaquín Torres-García, Alberto Giacometti, Henri Matisse, Joan Miró, Piet Mondrian, and Pablo Picasso, who even mentored him. After returning to New York in 1938, he became a founding member of The Club, a group of artists who were at the heart of the emerging New York School. In the late 1950s, Ferren joined forces with film director Alfred Hitchcock, serving as artistic consultant for the films The Trouble with Harry (1955) and Vertigo (1958).

Pure Evil,"Charles Uzzell-Edwards is a British graffiti artist known by the moniker ""Pure Evil"" and is a stablemate of Banksy. He is also the son of Welsh painter John Uzzell Edwards. He was born in South Wales where he grew up in a world of art thanks to his father. The father’s artwork undoubtedly impacted the son, demonstrating a range of influences from cubism to minimalism, from Matisse to Chagall. To understand a bit about Pure Evil it is illuminating to know that he is a descendant of Sir Thomas More, the Lord Chancellor who wrote the controversial work Utopia and who was later beheaded by King Henry VIII. With this busy background (Sir Thomas was later canonised) it is only natural that Pure Evil should explore the darker side of the wreckage of Utopian dreams and the myth of the Apocalypse, a belief in the life-changing event that brings history with all its conflicts to an end. Pure Evils ancestry is alleged to include eight saints: Vladimir the Great, Saint Anna of Russia, the Holy Martyrs Boris and Gleb, Saint Stephen of Hungary, Saint Margaret of Scotland and Saint Mathilde together with Saint Thomas More, Humbert III of Savoy and several European royal families.He was also a descendant of the Old English Chieftain Ailric, Kings Thane to Edward the Confessor, who held Cawthorne and much of South Yorkshire before the Conquest. The physical and cultural landscape of the 1990′s U.S. intrigued and beckoned the young Pure Evil–upon completing his studies in graphics and fashion he set off for California’s West Coast. He established himself in San Francisco, working for the Anarchic Adjustment clothing label as a designer. He produced countless t-shirt graphics for screen printing, dropped in on the west coast party scene, and dropped a lot of psychedelics. Pure Evil also became involved in the musical fabric of San Francisco and worked as an electronic recording artist for Peter Namlook’s ambient music label, FAX (based in Frankfurt, Germany). Pure Evil’s art is heavily inspired by skate culture and graffiti artists from the west coast. As an artist Pure Evil’s enthusiasm for street art grew as he returned to London after a 10 year stay in California. Starting out by painting strange fanged bunny rabbits anywhere and everywhere, is how his passion for urban art led to him picking up a spray can. That tag of a vampire bunny rabbit was bore from the artists feeling of remorse after he shot a rabbit in the countryside as a youth. By developing a true unique style of painting, his simple vision of the dark side aided the creation of his new works. Pure Evil fell in with the people behind Banksy’s Santas Ghetto and started producing dark new prints and artwork. In the past five years he has exhibited worldwide in China, Russia, Mongolia, Brazil, USA, and all over Europe. In 2012 Pure Evil appeared on the BBC TV show The Apprentice, where he took part in an urban art task, this led to a huge increase in interest for his work. His art has moved off the walls and onto a stunning range of limited edition prints many of which are iconic images he has ‘Evilised’ such as ‘Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Bastards’. All these Pure Evil artists prints are available for purchase. He opened the Pure Evil Gallery in Shoreditch, East London, in 2007 and lives in Hackney.",1334
Nick Walker,"No matter what you choose to devote yourself to, there’s often going to be someone or something that you look up to as a role model, following that subject to a certain degree in your own work and being inspired by it. Given that the field of art is nearly as old as man himself, the choice of artists and movements you may wish to follow goes rather far in all directions. However, we’ve seen quite a few ways of artistic expression being invented just recently, and many of those looking to work with graffiti and stencils often turn to Nick Walker and his oeuvre for guidance. As one of the most known stencil artists that assisted the movement’s development, he has inspired many contemporary artists with his work.  As one of the “younger” art movements that appeared during the 1960s, stencil graffiti gained a lot of momentum despite its slow start. Through the use of the medium by some of the most known artists today, Nick Walker contributed to this development in the early 1990s as he saw its potential. The ease with which such artwork spread isn’t attributed only to its form, but to the influence that the artists would have on other artists. In such a lush urban environment, the influence of stencil artists created a ripple effect, spreading quickly across the pool that is the global art world. Naturally, Walker had his own source of inspiration for using stencils. Using the medium of stencils was a sort of a controversy during his graffiti days; Walker was dissuaded by a fellow Bristol artist going under 3D (Massive Attack) in the early 1990s, pulling him into the world of stencils. He, in turn, had an impact on many other contemporary colleagues of the time. Although the comparison slightly annoys the artist, the work of Banksy comes to mind when talking about such effects. Given their similar age and the time they both started working with stencil, it’s unclear whether one’s work had influenced the other or vice versa; either way, Nick Walker remains one of the towering figures of the movement even today.   Nick Walker started out as purely a graffiti artist. Even though stencils appeared back in the 1960s, they were looked at as if forbidden by the graffiti population due to their strict form and predetermined lines. It was all about the free movement and can-control at the time and Walker wouldn’t realize the potential of the medium until 1992 when he had started using it.  Combining his graffiti freehand methods with the defined lines of stencils, Walker was defining the art movement throughout the 1990s and later on. The freedom that came with the medium came in the form of him being able to pick an image out of any aspect of life and easily portray it on any surface while retaining the ability to easily recreate it elsewhere. Not only that, but the application of work was much faster than completely making the piece manually, and since graffiti is generally against the law, the feat comes in handy.    As it comes with the territory, any work done in a public place will get to be perceived by a great many people. Walker’s practice tends to sway towards the ironic and humorous side, one most often portrayed through his alter ego going by the name of The Vandal. Knowing the size of his audience, Walker made his opinion on certain political decisions known on more than one occasion. Most famous of these “interventions” was the Le Corancan done in 2010 as an answering to the French President Sarkozy’s intention to ban the Burqa in France. The piece was quickly removed from the streets of Paris; alas, many other Walker’s pieces stand to this day, changing the way people view not only art made in this way, but the subjects he depicts.   Nick Walker’s work can be titled as nothing less than monumental. His practice has paved the way for other street artists in Britain and wider and created the mold for those looking to get immersed into the craft. Recognized by the press and the art world alike, Walker made a smooth transition into the gallery ambient in recent years, presenting his pieces on canvas while maintaining his street renown. Constantly inventing new ways to surprise and entice the public (the prime example being his Moona Lisa done in 2006), Nick Walker remains a towering influence in the ever-developing world of street art. The artist is represented by Galerie Brugier-Rigail, Artsuggest.com, HANG-UP GALLERY, Ministry of Walls, 30WORKS Gallery.  ",1335
Vhils,"Vhils is the pseudonym of a Portuguese street artist Alexandre Farto, one of the most skilled and talented young artists on the urban art scene today. This internationally acclaimed innovator creates technically skilled portraits on the streets around the world - however, instead of only adding paint or other common street art materials onto surfaces, Vhils also carves, drills, scratches, rips and blasts his images out of architectural walls. Although he became famous thanks to these fascinating chiseled facade portraits[1], Alexandre Farto has been interacting visually with the urban environments since his days as a graffiti writer in the early 2000s.   Alexandre Farto was born in Portugal and grew up on the outskirts of Lisbon, in an area that had been deeply affected by the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Constantly drawing as a child, Farto moved on to graffiti at a mere age of ten. Tagging became a way to fill time, something to do on the way to school, a byproduct of friendship. When he was 13, he became obsessed with train-bombing Lisbon’s suburban lines. He wound up skipping a lot of school in that pursuit and he soon joined the 2S/3D and LEG crews, gaining some graffiti street cred. His experience of the contrast between utopian socialist dreams and the stark reality of a developing capitalist society in the 1980s provides us with the background to the pieces he created by dissecting poster ads and carving into or excavating walls with tools such as etching acid, bleach, rotary hammer drills and other processes, to reveal their layers. Vhils quickly expanded to train lines outside of Lisbon, beyond Portugal, and finally across all of Europe.    Like any other local street artist at the time, amalgamating an audience and staging his work in new ways became the focus of Farto's work. Furthermore, he realized that focusing in on the process of destruction to create something more interesting is only feasible by manipulating what currently exists.[2] Alexandre studied at the University of the Arts - Central St Martins College of Art and Design. As a London graduate, Alexandre Farto is fully aware of the influence that this city's history has had on his artistic pursuits. He felt compelled to communicate the essence and transition London's streets have lived through and to channel these elements through his own work. Once he began exhibiting his pieces, Alexandre chose to maintain the initial tag next to his real name. Going by the same alias of Vhils (for me, these were the best and fastest letters to write at the time), his work has obtained plenty of interest in the year of 2008 when a face carved into a wall appeared alongside a picture by street artist Banksy in London, at the Cans Festival. A photograph of him creating the work appeared on the front page of The Times. However, his groundbreaking carving technique was first presented to the public a year before, at the VSP group show in Lisbon where it had been hailed as one of the most compelling approaches to street art in recent years.  Vhils' name is now internationally very recognized. His trademark is the forming of dramatic, oversized portraits made by carving directly into outdoor walls, a process that often involves industrial methods such as drilling and controlled explosions. Using construction tools, he exposes and confronts the architectural surfaces as they narrate the story of the graphic and of the city itself. Etching acid and bleach, he begins to depict the canvas to be de-constructed. Then, with the use of hammers, chisels and rotary hammer drills, Vhils sculpts the stenciled pieces to create texture, dimension and layers. The majority of Farto's subjects are anonymous and formerly unremarkable urban citizens: I like the idea of turning ordinary, common people into icons, to contrast this with the need people seem to have to create icons in the first place. Instead of creating icons out of people who have changed history, like what Andy Warhol was doing with Mao and others, I take an ordinary person and try and make people think about the ordinary citizens who struggle every day to make a living in contemporary society.[3] The use of John and Jane Doe is Vhils’ response to the picture-perfect models presented by advertising is a way to humanize a cityscape by giving it a face of the ordinary. One of the few exceptions to this rule is his 2012 mural made in Vivey (on the north shore of Lake Geneva, near Lausanne, Switzerland), interpreting Renee Burri's famous photograph of a latter-day Che Guevara, made for the Festival Images.    As for the artistic process, Farto generally first sketches out each piece in spray-paint, before beginning the painstaking process of chipping, sawing, and drilling away at the wall to various depths. He will often add additional color or shading to the newly exposed portions of the wall, creating a visual interplay between the untouched surface, originally painted figure and layers of underlying material: I like to use destructive means to create artwork that is meaningful and poetic, mostly portraits that can humanize the often oppressive public space that we find in our cities. You can think of stenciling that creates a symbolic window that helps reveal what lies hidden beneath the surface of things. It is a work of subtraction and exposure. The very nature of his approach allows for discovering the unexpected as he removes layers of a wall or a poster. He insists that not knowing what patterns and images await him below the surface is a key to his concept. The bottom line for Vhils is the method: an act of destruction as a creative force. His artistic philosophy follows the conversation begun by expressionists and abstract artists, where the technique and its result become inseparable. He attempts to create by removing; it is a conscious construction by way of destruction, whether shredding through billboard posters or drilling into a wall.   Farto’s work has been described as brutal and complex, yet imbued with a simplicity that speaks to the core of human emotions, expressing the struggle between the aspirations of the individual and the demanding, saturated environment of the urban spaces he lives in, highlighting and exposing the dimension that lies behind the current model of development and the material aspirations it encompasses – unsustainable, yet inebriating. In addition to his unmistakably identifiable street pieces[4], Vhils also has a few series of semi-traditional portraits done by tearing away portions of billboards and posters, as well as in metal and wood, similar to the famed decollage technique of Jacques Villegle. Such a successful transition from the streets to a gallery space is truly a rarity in the urban art world where such a radical change is often too overwhelming for authors.

Daze,"Few artists can be attributed with starting a complete art movement. With the 20th century having quite a few new directions in art initiated, one that keeps growing and reaching its full potential in contemporary times is street art. One of the artists that not only contributed in forming street art as we know it but had successfully managed to transition to the studio environment is Chris “Daze” Ellis. Working in line with Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, Daze uniquely described the meanness of the streets during the late years of the past century and continues to make distinct works today, both on canvas and city streets.  Starting out as a graffiti artist in the city of New York, Daze’s artistic journey started out as he painted the gray subways and city walls with distinct colors. He lived and worked in the time of other great “initiators” of street art like Basquiat and Haring, and though he shared their enthusiasm and mastery over the craft, he carried a unique style and energy that can be seen in his works. Delving into the part of society that was largely overlooked by fellow artists, Daze was able to carry across the meanness of the street that constituted the urban life of the 70s and 80s, and he did so unrivaled in his portrayals. As the years passed, Daze managed to shift from these so-called “urban adventures” towards not only many public art projects that are a part of his artistic oeuvre, but a completely new setting altogether.   With his first ever exhibition next to Basquiat and Haring, Daze managed to sell his first piece and in the following year of 1982, the first solo exhibition took place. It became a starting point for his successful transition into the gallery space and though he creates murals to this day, Daze’s output on the canvas became prolific and widely known. Taking his outdoor depictions from the street into the studio, Daze became one of the few artists that can be credited with accomplishing this feat, maintaining the enticement of his murals in his paintings.   Today, Chris “Daze” Ellis is known both for his painting works and murals; some of the public works he’s done over the years include the mural for the Star ferry terminal in Hong Kong, designing an entire train station in Hannover (Germany), mural for the Vivo City shopping center in Singapore, among others. More so, his professional career includes work that spans more than just art creation, as Daze held lectures at the Bronx Museum Hofstra University, as well as youth workshops with kids during the Hutuz festival in Rio de Janeiro. With an output that has covered galleries, streets, and cities worldwide, Chris “Daze” Ellis remains one of the prolific artists of our time.  ",1337
George Condo,"Regularly presenting us with a vast painted world populated with a cast of characters with deformed facial and bodily features, George Condo is a contemporary American artist best known for his signature brand of figuration which emphasizes fractured faces and aggressive imagery. In a career spanning more than three decades now, Condo’s highly distinctive body of work has consistently drawn upon art historical traditions and genres, especially the concept of portraits. Simultaneously, he was also mirroring contemporary social norms and referencing American culture of his time. By doing so, George was literally able to introduce Picasso-like techniques[1] to modern magazines, comics and cartoons. The results are characters with protruded eyes, bulbous cheeks and propagated limbs, all painted in a Cubistic-like method and located in a Pop new environment.   George Condo studied two subjects at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell, simultaneously focusing on Art History and Music Theory. During that time, he was studying guitar and composition while also dreaming of pursuing a career in painting. After two years spent in Lowell, Condo moved to Boston where he worked in a silkscreen shop - an experience that served him very well in future. He also joined a punk music band called The Girls, made up of young musicians with avant-garde views on both the music and the world. After a few small successes achieved with the band, George moved to the Ludlow Street in New York City, determined to get himself back on the course of becoming a full-time painter. He eventually emerged in the East Village art scene, noted for his characteristic concepts that were unlike anything else currently available. In this early stage of his career, Condo experimented with the concept he called Artificial Realism - the realistic representation of that which is artificial. This was supposed to describe his hybridization of traditional Old Master painting techniques with a sensibility of American Pop art. As he was still establishing his reputation and style, George continued to work in the silkscreen production studio, often collaborating with the legendary Andy Warhol. After he succeeded to hit it big, Condo moved to Cologne, Germany, where he met and worked with several new local artists from the famous Mulheimer Freiheit group[2]. This will eventually prove to be one of the pivotal periods of his career as Condo learned a lot about the concepts he used in his more mature pieces.                          Between the years of 1985 and 1995, Condo lived and worked mostly in hotel rooms and rented studios between the cities of Paris and New York. In the meantime, he continued to exhibit extensively both in the United States and Europe. By this time, George was already famous for his unique and exciting portraits made up of the bizarre cast of archetypal characters that inhabit them. All of his subjects were classically posed and dramatically lit, as if they were compositionally stolen right from some catalog of traditional art. However, Condo also used such concepts in a way to combine them with the new contemporary cultures of the modern world, blending the most widely renowned methods in art history with comic books, Playboy magazine issues and Saturday morning cartoons[3]. In one of the most famous interpretations of George's aesthetics, Calvin Tomkins stated the following: Instead of borrowing images or styles, Condo used the language of his predecessors, their methods and techniques, and applied them to subjects they would never have painted. Another interesting observation was said by Laura Hoptman, the curator in the Department of Painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. She said that George: opened the door for artists to use the history of painting in a way that was not appropriation. Such fantastic achievements naturally led George to many recognitions. In the year of 2000, Condo was the subject of the documentary film Condo Painting, directed by John McNaughton. A year before the film, the artist was handed an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which served as an overture for the Francis J. Greenburger Award George received in 2005. He also held numerous courses and lectures in his time, whilst his art was analyzed in various monographs. This made him into one of the most popular contemporary painters in the world, whilst his paintings and works were well attended and close followed wherever the gallery displaying them was - anywhere between New York and Paris. This popularity never truly stopped as Condo is prevalent in 2016 as ever. It should also be noted that Condo is well-known for book and album cover art - he provided the cover art for Jack Kerouac’s Book of Sketches and designed the album for Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.   [caption id=""attachment_315419"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] George Condo - Alexandra Hicks - Image via artmaplondon.com[/caption]  Ultimately, what tends to strike the viewers the most when observing Condo's pieces is not their aesthetics - which are amazing, make no mistake - but the sheer daring nature they possess. Not many artists would have the courage and confidence to adopt the techniques of some of the greatest avant-garde masters of painting and adapt them to their own creative needs. Although George's attempts to combine two very different worlds may seem borderline insulting to some, blending such traditional imagery and techniques with contemporary themes actually helps us observe and analyze the development of avant-garde art. It is in this fact that the greatest value of Condo's work lies as it provides us with a natural outcome to the arts of Pablo Picasso, Diego Velázquez, Henri Matisse and Cy Twombly, allowing us to witness first hand the continuity of modern art history and new takes on the same courses within it.  This artist is represented by Rosenbaum Contemporary Boca Raton Gallery, Vince Fine Arts Miami, Massimo De Carlo Milan, Massimo De Carlo London, Me Collectors Room Berlin, and Rosenbaum Contemporary Bal Harbour Gallery.

Niels Shoe Meulman,"In the world of art, there are several possible outcomes that every artist faces. First, the unpopular solution is quitting at some point; reaching the limits and working within them; surpassing the limitations and becoming a true master. Niels Shoe Meulman has done the fourth thing, revolutionizing the existing understanding of writing by combining traditional graffiti with calligraphy, creating a worldwide phenomenon called Calligraffiti. A technique that ultimately combined traditional and contemporary became visually quite unique and extremely popular. Now he works in a style he can proudly call his own and whose popularity pushed him to keep advancing.  Born and raised in Amsterdam, Meulman joined the city’s graffiti scene, which was rooted in a strange mix of subcultures; punk bands, football hooligans and squatters. However, in the early eighties, he was one of those kids who made a transition from that scene when hip-hop came along and went in New York where he met some of the graffiti icons, including Rammellzee, Dondi White, and Keith Haring. That’s when it all started for him. He never went to formal art school, but he did get educated in graphic techniques like lead letterpress and silk screen printing. Speaking of influences, on a popular and conceptual level, Shoe thinks that is amazing what the bigshots like Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Andy Warhol have achieved. Creating an intellectual oeuvre that appeals to the masses isn’t easy. On a painting level, he loves the organic strokes, graphic boldness and visualized freedom of abstract paintings by artists like Cy Twombly, Pierre Soulages, and Christopher Wool. They are gutsy, yet sensitive at the same time. And, of course, there’s the art of writing – ancient Japanese and Chinese ink drawings, Arabic Calligrams and illuminated books from medieval times. Good artists from each of these locations and times have mastered their craft so well that it shows a level of easy, something the Shoe finds very appealing. There’s always some of that in his work, even without any conscious effort.    In the early days of urban painting, he distanced himself from popular colorful graffiti and spent years only using silver and black. Shoe continued this purist approach in his Calligraffiti. But the color can be very seductive, so he slowly started to experiment with metallic and iridescent paints around 2012. Now that his style has become somewhat less (calli)graphic and is multilayered, he’s using color, but always in a way that it is unidentifiable. “A color is only an idea in a viewer’s mind. Colors don’t really exist in a way that shapes do. They are elusive.” In his recent works, the color of a pigment is defined by the viewing angle, the angle of light and creases in the unstretched canvas. As for the process itself – Meulman differentiate his artist work from his work as a designer. Without working with a brief of a proposition, the artist’s realm is solely his own, a state of mind where supposed opposites, such as madness and method, must merge. The painting generally begins with some sort of imagined visual (which is never anything like the result). Then, he lays out the canvas on the floor, sometimes pinning it down. If he’s not in a ‘winning mood’, he’ll not make the first move, sometimes waiting for a few hours or even days. After that, he uses his extended arsenal of brushes, brooms, fake plants, spray devices and plenty of acrylic ammunition to “give that woven rectangle a proper beating”. Basically, it’s a nonstop frenzy with lots of ups and downs, cursing, physical struggle and splattering all over the place. Fun and agony merged into one feeling.   In a nutshell, Meulman went from tagging to painting big pieces and experimenting with all sorts of letter styles. Then, through typography and lettering, he returned to his old love, calligraphy and started mixing this with urban tagging styles. When he discovered Calligraffiti and had his big show in 2007, he couldn’t have imagined it would become a worldwide phenomenon it is now. Recognizing that is an amazing feat he will always keep close to his heart, Shoe admits that its popularity did push him to keep advancing, so he now paint in a style that is completely his own. Some of the important milestones include the video of the Sweeping Beauty piece he did with water and a broom in Singapore. It has captured the imagination of many people. Also, he considers a fun experience the painting he did for Louis Vuitton - a Muhammad Ali tribute in a boxing ring with Mos Def . Meulman is also very happy with his new book, titled Shoe Is My Middle Name. Quite monumental and size and content, it shows a mixture of his paintings, poetry, theories, and many written contributions by people he respects in the world of art. He is represented by GCA Gallery, Vertical Gallery, Vroom & Varossieau, and Unruly Gallery.  ",1339
Sowat,"Sowat is a French artist - a screenwriter, film director and graffiti artist best known for his calligraffiti style and as a member of Da Mental Vaporz crew.  Sowat grew up between Southern France and Los Angeles, California. Majority of his family lives in California where he discovered quite early Chaz Bojorquez’s work and Cholo writing, a calligraphy created in the 1940s and intended to mark out the territories of Latino gangs. The mystery that surrounded it back then made a real impression and helped him develop a taste for calligraphy, inks, brushes, and other artworks that weren’t necessarily made with a spray can. This atrist started spraying when he was 15 or 16 and he matured artistically in the surroundings of Marseille and Los Angeles – he made his first paintings on the railways, highways and wastelands of Marseille. “I didn’t draw before, so these first nights spent painting along the train tracks behind my high school were my true gateway to the world of arts.” Sowat was most influenced by the streets of his Mediterranean hometown, people like Abel, Seek or Cam from the 313 Crew and the book ‘Paris Tonkar’ - through its pages he discovered the work of BBC’s, Mode2, Bando, Number 6 and so on…   After studying political sciences Sowat wrote a book ‘La France d’en bas’ with Gris1, in 2003. The book documented the rise of the graffiti movement in the south of France. After that, Sowat moved to Paris to work in the video game industry as a writer, where he lingered on for a few years, painting as much as he could in his free time together with Bomk, Kan and Blo.  Sowat finally managed to quit his day jobs to focus back on painting in 2009. He is an integral part of the celebrated European crew DMV (Da Mental Vaporz) with whom he has travelled the world. DMV is a French graffiti crew consisting of Bom.K, Blo, Brusk, Dran, Gris1, Iso, Jaw, Kan, Sowat & Lek.  The crew was created in 1999 by Bom.k and Iso in the Paris suburbs and it stood out by making huge murals in sordid lands within the southern suburbs, showcasing different subjects from traditional graffiti.  Their artworks span over tens of meters high and wide, depicting monstrous characters, madness and the imminent end of times. Sowat successfully joined the team in 2008, with his throw-ups and calligraffiti… DMV crew successfully manages to maintain the aesthetical unity of the group while strengthening their own individualities.  In 2009 Sowat met Lek, a Urbex legend – the practice of taking over places that are derelict but with a powerful history. his teaming up with Lek marks the beginning of their Mausolée project that took place in a disused supermarket in the Parisian outskirts, which they invested with forty French Graffiti artists, from the first to the last generation of the graffiti movement. For a year, all artists continuously wandered in this 430,000 sq ft monument to paint murals and organize an illegal artistic residency. Together they created Mausolée, a temple dedicated to the disappearing of underground culture that is slowly being replaced by street art and its global pop aesthetics. Following the success of this Mausolée project, Lek and Sowat put together two major group shows at the Palais de Tokyo in 2013, Dans les entrailles  and Terrains Vagues.  When their two years residency at the Palais de Tokyo ended, Lek and Sowat invited Graffiti’s living legends Mode2 and Futura2000 to work with them inside one of the institution’s most unusual spaces. So, Lek, Sowat, Mode2 and the Futura 2000 teamed up in Paris to work on a series of new pieces inside the Palais de Tokyo. Organised by Hugo Vitriani, the all-star team went deep under the Palais de Tokyo to work on the pieces inside a crypt inaccessible to the public. Using a catchphrase (Underground doesn’t Exist Anymore) works are executed with chalk, pastel and water by Mode2, and are framed by Lek and Sowat’s graphic lacerations and Futura’s 2000 aerosol signature moves. During that time him and Lek secretly shot a film titled Direct Traces, a project about the apparition and destruction in graffiti culture, discreetly inviting twenty artists to draw on a blackboard. They have participated in a roundtable with Jacques Villeglé at the Centre Pompidou, the project les Bains Douches, the Tour Paris 13, and also an exhibition at Agnes B’s at Galerie du Jour in 2013 where he worked on a collective work with Jonone and Lek.  In 2014, the exhibition Contrebande was held at Marrakech’s Galerie David Bloch. Within that show, Sowat, Lek and Arnaud Liard occupied a street of Guéliz to make 10m-long monumental mural, where they integrated Arab patterns to their geometrical style to set into perspective the local architecture. They completed two murals in Marrakech - one in Medina and a second one in the new town with local artists. Graffiti is seen as an urban pollution, so the trio chose to confront themselves to the prestige of Moroccan ornaments, the treasures of the country’s history and its tourists’ clichés. What is special about it and particularly important is that street art doesn’t exist in Morocco; therefore, this was an extraordinary moment for both the artists and people living there.  In 2015, Sowat and Lek made a piece for Le Mur Saint Etienne, France. The idea behind that work was to create a modern and abstract war banner. So, he spent the first night tracing black bits and pieces of deconstructed letters with dripping paint brushes that Lek covered the next day with gold circles and lines. Sowat is an artist for whom graffiti represents only the tip of the iceberg in his love of expression & creativity. He is always looking for new calligraphy styles, on canvas or paper, with a bamboo stick or a spray can...  Sowat surrently lives and works in Paris, France.",1340
Brusk,"Brusk is a French artist best known for his dripping style, who craves new techniques and discusses various media (photo, video, computer), thereby pushing its limits and opening up new creative worlds. In control of numerous tools, he can work both with figures and abstraction, realism or graphic clean. His style developed over the years combines a calligraphic work in 3D, characters and tagging. The balance of his compositions is based on a subtle space management, voids, accumulations, materials, and multilayered plans.  Brusk developed creativity from an early age. Born in 1976 in Lyon, with a pencil in his hand, Brusk spent his time scribbling until his encounter with the graffiti and Hip Hop in 1991. A graduate of the Ecole des Beaux – Arts in St. Etienne, his thorough work on the graffiti becomes a completely atypical case for faculty. In 2013, he produced, in just eight days with his Da Mental Vaporz (DMV) Crew, a monumental 38 meters high mural in Strasbourg. His painting named Death Kiss, estimated between 7 000 and 9 000 euros, was finally sold for 16 000 euros on the sale of Art Contemporain Urbain in 20015.     He manages to mix together different influences arising from the photography, comics, film but also its acuity to grasp the urban aesthetic. His willingness to transpose into worlds other than the original one led him to work on the textile, furniture design, various projects, and multimedia. Adopting new techniques and using various media, he pushes his own limits of creativity and opens the new artistic universe of his own. His style evolves over time and the technical mastery allows him to make a variety of works, as figurative, abstract, realistic or refined graphics. ",1341
Pichi & Avo,"Pichi & Avo is a renowned graffiti duo from Spain that produces a spectacular explosion of fresh colors and impressions. They create breathtaking figurative detail and quality. Their work is very striking and always commands the spectator’s full attention.  Pichi and Avo mix their own studies degree in their work design and fine arts. All has began in 2007, bringing a spectacularly lucid splash of Mediterranean color to the streets of Valencia and wider Spain, Pichi and Avo have infused a stunning level of figurative detail into their work. Hints of surrealism leap out and slap the viewer about while drawing you into a radiant explosion of unrestrained, spray painted talent. Creating a massive stir in their hometown and just about to set the rest of Europe ablaze, leads them to participate in numerous national and international events. From Valencia- Spain, Pichi & Avo are one, fleeing from the self-centeredness of graffiti, united to create a single piece of work, two similar visions of the world are the result of their work, which is constantly evolving. Stroke, signatures, collage… explosions of colors that invade the subconscious, precipitated by the personal rant of their artistic ideology and an aesthetic widely argued in the texts of Walter Benjamin. Pichi & Avo have merged within their work an amazing level of figurative detail with touches of surrealism, they have attacked and beaten the spectator, bringing them in whilst immersing them in a radiant burst of spray talent where all barriers are surpassed. Pichi & Avo recite a conceptually urban poetry, born from the artistic formalism of the street, using any artistic inventiveness that can be applied, transferring fragments of a wall to the canvas in a personal version, viewers can expect a heady concoction of ancient and modern that remixes classics from art's illustrious history and rewrites the rulebook in the process. Pichi & Avo both live and work in Valencia, Spain.",1342
Icy and Sot,"Iranian street art brothers, Icy and Sot, after living for just two years in USA, have developed a rich portfolio of urban stencils that address global social issues. Even though they come from a specific culture and country situation, their work remains more global than just about Iran. Icy and Sot began putting up small stenciled works on the streets of Tabriz and posting the images on the Internet. Documenting their work was important because the art would be erased within two or three days of being created. They became leaders in the Iranian urban art culture since their first works in 2006, in their hometown Tabriz. In 2011, brothers had their first solo exhibition abroad, in Amsterdam. After that and since their arrival in New York in 2012, their reputation has only increased only to create an international notoriety and respect. Icy & Sot even curated a gallery show in 2014 that introduces Iran and the US to one another through the visual vernacular of Street Art. With two shows running concurrently in Tehran and Brooklyn, the stencil-loving spray painters have successfully exposed fans of this genre to the artists in another country with actual examples of art in a gallery setting rather than simply through the Internet. This dynamic duo is really doing a great job on a self-proclaimed “creative crusade to dismantle pre-conceived perceptions of a fleeting Iranian tradition.” The two brothers have held numerous exhibitions around the world and their outdoor works have been seen on the streets of Iran, Turkey, France, Brazil, San Francisco, New York… Their parents support their move to the U.S, even though it means that Icy and Sot can’t ever go back to visit them in Iran. But, for now, their parents follow them on Facebook, which is blocked in Iran, but savvy users can find ways around it. Icy and Sot live in Brooklyn, New York.",1343
Bruce Nauman,"Creating art of any sort can take anywhere from an instant to years and most artists like to do it at their own pace, not having to insert the time variable into the equation. After a while, the process of creating art becomes the art itself, as Bruce Nauman came to realize in his practice. Focusing primarily on the activity of art making rather than on the product itself, Nauman produces a variety of works across several mediums and techniques that fundamentally question the role of the artist. Dealing with and inspired by all the gory details of life and death, he reveals, as his inscription states every artist should, all the mystic truths.  Bruce Nauman was born in 1941 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Throughout his life, he was moving a lot with his family because of his father's work as an engineer for General Electric. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison he studied physics and mathematics between 1960 and 1964, and with William T. Wiley and Robert Arneson at the University of California, he studied art from 1965-1966. In 1964, he decided that he wants to dedicate himself to sculpture, performance and cinema and upon receiving his MFA in 1966, he taught at the San Francisco Art Institute until 1968 and at the University of California at Irvine in 1970. The following decade, Nauman moved a couple of times until finally finding a home in New Mexico. In 1989, he established his home studio in Galisteo, the place where he works and lives to this day accompanied by his wife, the painter Susan Rothenberg.   With his studio set up and ready, Nauman was confronted with the question “What to do?” and soon he’d come up with a simple yet profound realization that “If I was an artist and I was in the studio, then whatever I was doing in the studio must be art. At this point art became more of an activity and less of a product.” Other than his home studio in Galisteo, he’s got another one set up in a former grocery shop in the Mission district of San Francisco as well as in a sublet from his university tutor in Mill Valley. These two locations server Nauman for performance art that he filmed on a fixed camera, making 10-minute duration takes. He made several videos in the period of 1966-1970, in which he used his body to investigate the role of the artist and psychological states and behavioral codes.   A big part of his work is characterized by an interest in language, as Neuman explores the role of the artist in this field as well. This often manifests itself in a playful, mischievous manner, and a good example of this practice is the neon Run From Fear - Fun From Rear, or the photograph Bound To Fail, which shows the literalized title phrase as the artist's arms are tied behind his back. At the heart of his practice are some, one could say, serious concerns. His fascination with nature of communication, language's inherent problems, and the role of an artist as a mean of communication and manipulator of visual symbols manifest itself through his art. As a major influence on his art, Bruce Nauman cites Samuel Beckett, John Cage, Philip Glass, La Monte Young, Meredith Monk, as well as Ludwig Wittgenstein for whom he, in a 1970 interview, says: “Just the way Wittgenstein proceeds in thinking about things, his awareness of how to think about things. I don’t think you can point to any specific piece that’s the result of reading Wittgenstein, but it has to do with some sort of process of how to go about thinking about things.”   The beginning of the 1970s marked a time of investigating the psychology of the mind for Nauman, portraying the realm of dreams as much as phobias through his sculptural work.  During this time, he began constructing claustrophobic and enclosed corridors and rooms that gave out a feeling of entrapment, being closed in and left abandoned. The sculptures were “usable” and viewers could enter these spaces, getting a first-hand feeling of what the artist is trying to convey. A series of works created between 1983 and 1988 was inspired by one of his dreams, and they were brought together under the title of Dream Passage. Another piece from this period is the installation titled Changing Light Corridor with Rooms from 1971; it is made as a long corridor shrouded in darkness, with two rooms on either side that are illuminated by bulbs timed to flash at different rates. This period evolved into sculptures and videos after the mid-1980s when Nauman had developed disturbing psychological and physical themes that involved images of animal and human body parts.   Nauman’s monumental art inspired many other artists through the second half of the 20th century, and it’s no wonder his work has been exhibited widely across the globe. His first shows occurred in the 1960s with exhibitions at Nick Wilder’s gallery in Los Angeles and in New York at Leo Castelli in 1968, with some of his early solo shows taking place at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum in 1972. Demonstrating his talent, the Nicholas Wilder Gallery held his first solo exhibition of fiberglass sculptures in 1966, before he even received his master’s degree. Fame followed, and some of his later exhibitions, like the one at The Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Marcia Tucker at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, traveled across Europe and the United States in 1972; the major retrospective held at the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, and the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden. Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, also traveled to many venues throughout America and Europe in a period from 1993 to 1995. In 1997, the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg mounted another major retrospective, which toured the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Hayward Gallery in London and Nykytaiteen Museo in Helsinki.   Speaking of his brilliant craft are his many awards on several fields of artistic practice. Bruce Nauman holds honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degrees from both the San Francisco Art Institute and the California Institute of the Arts. In 1993, he received the Wolf Prize for his distinguished work as a sculptor as well as his extraordinary contribution to twentieth-century art. It was followed by the Golden Lion of the Venice Biennale in 1999, and Praemium Imperiale for sculpture in 2004. The same year, he was named by Time Magazine as one of their 100 most influential people, elevating his practice even further. Although his works span a wide variety of styles and materials, it hasn’t diminished neither his ability to produce first class art nor their value; on the contrary, his mastery on so many fields makes him one of the monumental contemporary artists.   In the words of Peter Plagens, an artist, writer and art critic, Bruce Nauman isn’t afraid of throwing all the chips in the air, picking them up and starting again. In his explorations of reality, truth, and the artist’s role in all of it, his practice has led him to many different mediums. Mastering all of them, he became one of the key figures of the contemporary artistic era, and The True Artist for Plagens who wrote a book about him. With his works revealing ideas and mysteries and the artist’s relation to them, there’s no telling where his practice might take us next.  ",1344
Thomas Struth,"One of the major figures of German photography, Thomas Struth is an incomparable contemporary photographer whose main body of work concentrates on documenting a wide range of subjects such as urban scenes, rain forests and group, candid portraits. By combining a rigorous style with a neutral, objective perception of reality and an impressively accurate technique[1], Struth authors mesmerizing photographs that expose his deep belief in photography as a tool of scientific origin for psychological exploration.  Thomas Struth is a son of a ceramic potter Gisela Struth and a bank director Heinrich Struth. He was born in Geldern, Germany, and was trained at the Düsseldorf Academy from 1973 until 1980, spending his college days learning about different art techniques. Interestingly, Thomas initially studied painting practices, learning under the guidance of Peter Kleemann and Gerhard Richter. However, as he was becoming increasingly drawn to photography, Struth joined the new photography class run by Bernd and Hilla Becher in the year of 1976. That same year, he was a part of a student exhibition at the Academy where Struth showed a grid composed of forty-nine photographs taken from a centralized perspective on Düsseldorf’s desolate streets[2].   During the late 1970s, Thomas traveled both to England and France, making various images with his camera along the way. During the 1980s, Struth added a new dimension to his work when he started to produce complex portraits. Some of these images were black and white whilst some were made in color, but all of them were attempting to show the underlying social dynamics within an apparently still photograph. In 1989, Struth began work on his best-known series, titled as Museum Photographs, a project devoted to the visitors to some of the world's greatest museums and buildings, including The Art Institute of Chicago, the Musée du Louvre in Paris, the Accademia in Venice and the Pantheon in Rome.    Struth's photographic profile continued to expand during the 1990s. Between 1998 and 2006[3], the photographer began scouring the earth for jungle settings to photograph, searching for the sights in Japan, Australia, China, America and Europe. He continued to expand his collection of family portraits along the way. In 2007, Thomas was an artist in residence at the Atlantic Center for the Arts. During that same year, Struth also married the author Tara Bray Smith in New York City. Due to the incredibly discipline and uncompromising nature, Struth's work has been widely shown in solo and group exhibitions around the globe. His first solo show outside of Germany took place at Fruitmarket Gallery of Edinburgh in 1987 - since then, his work traveled around the world on regular basis[4]. In 2007, he became the first contemporary artist ever to be exhibited at the Museo del Prado, Madrid, among the permanent collection of old masters.   Nowadays, the name of Thomas Struth is usually found along the lines of such authors as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer and Thomas Ruff. This is evidential enough of just how important this photographer is to contemporary German art history - his systematic approach to taking photographs is one of the most inspirational practices photographic art has in its arsenal. Struth's disciplined, meticulous approach to creating pictures results in hypnotizing works that confront the viewers with a unique experience - an act of looking at the social complexities of seeing and being seen.

Julie Mehretu,"Born in Ethiopia, but spending most of her career in The United States where she settled as a kid, the artist Julie Mehretu is famous for her printmaking and painting with a strong note of abstraction. She is responsible for large scale prints, drawings and paintings that are based on heavy layering in order to create images from patterns and architectural photographs - although the end result does not give away what Mehretu used to start creating. Literally hundreds of thin and transparent layers of paint and paper cover the canvas of each painting, blending with each other and collectively creating an amazing effect.  Julie Mehretu was born during the year of 1970, in the town Addis Ababa, a capital city of Ethiopia. When little Julie was about seven years of age, her family decided it was time to move on and so they left for the West, settling in the state of Michigan, United States. Mehretu never forgot her ethnical roots, but her childhood was typically American from that point on. She was an excellent student and that provided her with numerous opportunities to expand her education - she studied at the University Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar for starters, later applying in the Kalamazoo College where she earned a BA in Arts. Ultimately, Julie earned an MFA at the Rhode School of Art and Design during the year of 1997. These vast educational experiences helped Mehretu to build an impressive foundation for her future as an artist. Since she graduated in the year of 1997, Mehretu stayed in New York City and opened up a studio there, successfully starting what will soon become an excellent painter's career. She started working with architectural renderings and aerial views of urban grids, combining hundreds of them until a point the starting material becomes unrecognisable - these fragments are stripped from their real-world specificity and challenging narrow geographic and cultural readings, becoming a part of something unique and new. After she finishes up, the pieces sometimes take up to weeks to dry off. Building a reputation from the grounds up was a challenge and not an easy one at that, especially when you consider the radical method that Julie was trying to establish. After being a part of numerous exhibitions of the group character, Mehretu's first major solo exhibition, titled as Grey Area, took place at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2010.    Many art critics have often linked Mehretu's work with some early 20th century movements, claiming that this artist found much influence in the paintings of numerous avant-garde ideas. Julie has been connected to everything between Futurism and Constructivism, which is all basically true since her art heavily relies upon abstraction and expression - both of which were in the development process during the early years of the 20th century. Putting aside many attempts to figure out what influenced Julie the most, the safest method is to listen Mehretu herself who admitted to learning a lot by viewing the paintings of Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman. All of her works - regardless of format, size or medium - involve symbolism Mehretu draws from street art, city charts and comic books. Colourful explosions and sharp or arching lines are ever present in her art, fueling her her body of work from the inside. The formal qualities of light and space found in her pieces are made all the more complex by Mehretu’s delicate depictions of fire, explosions and perspectives - in both two and three dimensions. Besides the aforementioned studio in The Big Apple, it should be noted that Mehretu also owns both a residence and a studio in the city of Berlin, often working and creating in the heart of German's capital. Mehretu’s drawings, paintings and prints have been included in numerous exhibitions all over the world, with the arguable highlight being the 2002's Drawing Now: Eight Propositions, placed inside the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The Palazzo Grassi in Venice also hosted her work for their Praise Of Doubtexhibition in 2011. Among Mehretu’s awards are the Berlin Prize from the American Academy in Berlin(2007), a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award (2005) and the American Art Award from the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2005). It should be noted that Mehretu also dabbles in the medium of street art - one of the artist’s most widely acknowledged urban works is the 80-foot-wide mural located in Goldman Sachs tower entitled simply as Mural.    Mehretu uses the 21st-century city as a building block, transferring its energy into her gestural sweeps of paint and built-up marks in ink and pencil—often transposed from projections. She contracts seemingly infinite urban narratives, architectural views and street plans into single unified compositions. It's fascinating how much control Mehretu is able to hold on to, especially when you consider the wild nature of the abstraction and the fact Julie uses an incredible number of layers in her work. Exciting and in full control, Julie Mehretu is undoubtedly one of the most impressive abstract artists out there. The artist is represented by White Cube Bermondsey and White Cube Mason's Yard, both galleries in London, United Kingdom.

Martin Whatson,"Martin Whatson is a Norwegian stencil artist, born in 1984. He studied Art and Graphic Design in Oslo, at the Westerdals School of Communication. There he started to develop an interest in the art of graffiti and stencil. Since 2004, he started producing his own works, and has participated in many exhibitions. He also collaborated with many other urban artists. A street art follower since the nineties decade, it wasn’t until he discovered Banksy when he decided to try with the stencil. This is why his work combines these two elements in a unique way and it is characterized by grey monochromatic images done with stencils and decorated with graffiti of vibrant colors. Martin Whatson is inspired by people, posters or other graffiti and has a weakness for urban spaces that are decayed and abandoned. When starting out he found himself drawn to political subjects, inspired by DOLK and Banksy, but over time found his depth in more subtle types of expression. His work is not charged with a political or social criticism but he likes to leave a subtle message on which anyone can reflect and draw his or her own conclusions. Martin Whatson creates unique stencil scenes, with a message signifying peace and love, and a very distinct female edge. Yet his work still appeals in a masculine way, packed with bold statements that say a lot about the world today. He is an emotional artist that seeks to transmit feelings and with a great taste for aesthetics and the beauty of images and color. We can find his work shown to the public in urban murals in cities of his homeland, like Stavanger or Oslo but he has also crossed his country frontiers to other places like Paris and Tokyo. Nowadays his works combine these urban mediums with works developed on canvases or other materials such as metals or wood. Regarding Martin Watsons’ graphic work, we can say that he is a quite prolific artist and his prints are sold out really fast. There aren’t many prints we can find in galleries as the mayor part of his editions are limited to only a few copies, usually hand finished, and because of that, a big part of them is already in hands of private collectors. In the many festivals and exhibitions he has participated in for about a decade now, Martin Whatson had the chance to work with other urban artists such as Roamcouch, Pure Evil or Snik. Striving to be different, Martin finds beauty in what most people find “ugly”, unfashionable or simply out dated, creating something beautiful out of what most people don’t even notice in daily life. This interest has helped develop his style, motives and composition. Since his artistic debut in 2004, he has had several solo shows and participated in many group exhibitions, both nationally, and internationally in cities like Tokyo, Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles.",1347
Alison Jackson,"The contemporary artist who knows how to explore the cult of celebrity, the phenomena that are created by the media, publicity, and famous figures themselves, is definitely Alison Jackson. Her interest is more focused on commenting photography rather than the process of making it, thus she tries to raise questions about people’s obsessions with persons they don’t know, but feel to know intimately. Her art can be seen alongside current fake news, alternative facts and debates, in which she uses lookalikes to reconstruct celebrities in their private unconventional situations and moments. In that way, she creates scenarios which were imagined in people’s heads, but were never available to them, because the media can’t get them. Photographer’s works are highly respected for their funny, sometimes provoking elements and comments on the phenomena of modern culture.   She was born in 1970, in Southsea, Hampshire, but grew up in a converted 11th-century monastery in Gloucestershire, which had a chapel and a network of secret tunnels. Since her childhood, Alison showed interest in horse riding, and photography. Being located in the middle of nowhere she used it as an escape from the reality. She graduated Fine Art Sculpture from the Chelsea College of Art and Design as an adult student, where she became an abstract painter, who later made a small number of critically acclaimed paintings. Her famous graduation piece Crucifix from 1997, was priced at £ 1500, and just a couple years later it was estimated ten times more. Later, Jackson gained MA in Fine Art Photography from the Royal College of Art, London.   The artist has become popular for her realistic photographs that deconstruct and humanize celebrity establishment, to whom members of the royal family belong, but also relates her art to religion which also creates iconic figures. Alison’s techniques allow similarities to become real, and fantasies to seem believable. She makes the audience wonder whether they can believe in what they see on television and the internet. Jackson gives political comments on the happenings as she is convinced that public today is removed from that area and doesn’t have much influence. Her focus is on the power and seductive nature of imagery, but also on voyeurism and the need to accept norms that are served.    As celebrities are used to construct their fake photographs for real, by using diverse methods that emerged in the recent history, such as filters, the author decided to show the private side of their stories perceived in her imagination. In 1999 she shocked the world with black and white photos of Princess Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed with a mixed-race love child. This piece was a part of her graduation series Mental Images. She continued by using lookalikes to represent former Prime Minister Tony Blair and US president George W. Bush in her series Behind the Scenes. In 2016 she had trouble to publish paparazzi-style photos of the American President Donald Trump because many were afraid of the legal consequences. At the end, she self-published them because she is an artist, and she is not scared of anyone. Some of the images are explicit and depict the sex scene between the president and Miss Mexico in the Oval Office.    As the artist works across all media platforms and arts in books, TV, Publishing, news, and press her artworks have really become part of popular culture as the images of celebrities. Jackson is responsible for BBC2 project Doubletake, for which she won BAFTA. She is also an Ambassador for the Spinal Injuries Association in the UK. In 2011 her book Up the Aisle was published, consisting 300 images of her perception on the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. Her work has been exhibited at the ArtBelow and Ben Brown Gallery, London, at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, at the HG Contemporary, New York and in many other places.   ",1348
Adolph Gottlieb,"Adolph Gottlieb was an American painter, born on March 14, 1903 in New York. He was a pioneer of the Abstract Expressionism movement, working closely with other artists seeking new ways of self-expression. He left high school when he was 16 and enrolled in the Art Students League in New York where he studied painting under Robert Henri and John Sloan. In 1921 Gottlieb worked on a steamer for his passage to Europe. He took classes at the Académie de la Chaumière in Paris and later traveled to Munich and Berlin. Returning to New York in 1923, he finished high school and for the next six years studied at art schools in the city. He was awarded a joint prize in the Dudensing National Competition in 1929 and in the following year shared a two-man exhibition with Konrad Cramer at Dudensing Galleries in New York. In the early 1930s he met Mark Rothko and Milton Avery, painters at the Art Students League, who represented the expressionist movement in America at the time. Thus, in the 1930s Gottlieb turned inward to representations of his own character and philosophy rather than explicit social themes, even though during this period he was an easel painter for the Work Projects Administration Federal Art Project. As his interest in primitive art forms emerged, anticipating his ""pictographic"" paintings of the 1940s, Gottlieb won a U.S. Treasury competition for a post office mural in Yerrington, Nevada. In 1937 Gottlieb moved to the desert near Tucson, Arizona, an environment whose flora and relics contributed to a transformation in his subject matter and in his approach to painting. These abstract forms required an abstract environment in which to exist, and Gottlieb supplied this by tipping the table on which the still-life objects were placed. This moved the surface sharply toward the picture plane, flattening and reducing the space. He also compartmentalized objects as if by a personal mental discipline of sorting and regrouping. His palette then was rather limited, employing the soft earth colors of his environment. He returned to New York in 1939. Gottlieb began to paint what he called Pictographs in 1941. Again, it was the change in subject matter that provided some resolution for his problems with form. As he reported in 1955, ""It was necessary for me to repudiate so-called 'good painting' in order to be free to express what was visually true for me."" In the early pictographs, symbols or images remained recognizable and close to figuration, bits of nature or man-made objects, for example. These shapes, juxtaposed or overlapped in the composition, gradually became more abstract. The flattened images were applied to canvas with thick impasto and loose brush strokes and were organized into regular or irregular grid systems. The horizontal tiers and vertical rows seem to lend meaning to the otherwise static images. In a statement to the New York Times in 1943, Gottlieb and Mark Rothko summarized their aesthetic beliefs: ""We want to reassert the picture plane. We are for flat forms, because they destroy illusion and reveal truth."" By the end of the 1940s Gottlieb's images transcended narrative or illustrative connections. The particular identities of the shapes became obscure, but while they denied reference to a specific image, they acquired meaning as pure form. Archer (1951), a work which shows the transition from the pictographs to the imaginary landscapes, keeps residual regulations of the formerly divisive lines, but these are now placed randomly on the canvas. This looser linear arrangement is combined with two motifs, focused in the upper and lower zones, which are then more subtly repeated, in different colors, over the surface of the picture. The imaginary landscapes release the grid structure completely and become increasingly non-representational. They abandon recourse to mythical symbols and show Gottlieb's exploration of pure form and color. Gottlieb's most effective works were his oppositions of both colors and shapes in canvases called Bursts. In these paintings the picture plane is divided into two arbitrary horizontal zones. In one of these zones is placed a bright geometric form or an irregular aggregation of brushstrokes (Glow, 1966). For him, such intangible and illusive images were representations of his deepest inner feelings. His desire for pure expression was fulfilled with color and form arranged with apparent disregard for both subject and object, the simple depiction of a complex thought. In the 1960s Gottlieb's work received increasing acclaim. Among other honors, he was awarded the Grand Premio at the VII Bienal de São Paolo, Brazil. In 1968 a major retrospective exhibition was organized jointly by the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Gottlieb suffered a stroke in 1971, but continued to paint from a wheelchair. The following year he was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters, a tribute to his teaching and to his artistic innovation and production. He died in Easthampton, New York on March 4, 1974.",1349
Georges Mathieu,"A French painter and theorist, Georges Mathieu is best known for large-scale paintings featuring curving, calligraphic lines. He is considered the founder of Lyrical Abstraction and the organizer of the “Abstraction Lyrique” exhibition held in Paris in 1947. Born in 1921 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, Mathieu attended a variety of schools in Boulogne-sur-Mer and later in Lycée Hoche in Versailles. Thereafter, he studied English and law at the University of Lille. In 1942, he began making figurative paintings of England from postcards as a hobby. In 1944, he began his reflection on aesthetics held by the concept that painting does not need to represent to exist. Soon after, he executed his first non-figurative painting, Inception. Mahieu's working process had a performative character, with the speed of his execution being a signature component of his style, which he once described as “an orgasm of uncontrolled expression.” In addition to Lyrical Abstraction, he is also associated with Tachism, a style understood as emotional, intuitive and highly spontaneous, emphasizing the gestural and performative aspects of the act of painting. Mathieu also claimed to be the first to practice “Tubism”—squeezing paint directly from the tube—and the drip technique, though the latter is widely attributed to Jackson Pollock. ",1350
Katharina Grosse,"Katharina Grosse is a German painter, whose wall size paintings and even bigger installations made of seemingly incompatible materials and surfaces, are known around the world. She uses architecture and nature as the basis of her compositions, to whom she adds her imagination. Her unconventional approach is everything but traditional, leaving the impression of something abstract, or even psychedelic. Intertwined layers of expressive colors, canvas and other striking components used by Katharina, represent material records of the making process, and authors interconnection with the piece. Painting is both limitless and timeless, it challenges and triggers curiosity of the spectators.  Katharina Grosse was born in Freiburg in 1961, Germany. It was in her early 20’s when without any clear directions, she discovered painting. She dedicated almost a year practicing brush techniques, before starting her studies at the famous Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where she currently teaches. There she met Johannes Brus and Gotthard Graubner who were very influential on her. From 2000-2010 she worked as a professor at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weissensee. After graduation in 1990, she kept exploring different styles, before finding herself in abstraction. By applying diverse tonality of colors and paint, and changing a variety of tools and combinations of textures, Grosse investigates the psychological impact her pieces can have on the viewers. Her pictures are experimental, and perfect medium for structures and processes that usually don’t go together, or even exclude each other. Hence, they are able to provide all the visual aspects that catch people’s attention. Grosse’s art is full of improvisation, consists a note of sexuality and seems as if she is playing while working.    The desire for more intensive, unlimited, vast and spacious painting led the artist to spray gun. She immediately benefited from it, as it expanded her body’s reach and made it easier for her to move on uneven surfaces. It was in 2004 when Katharina made a shift in her artwork by putting paint all around her. Acrylic colors which the author puts on objects that surround her like doors, hallways, walls, are the best proof of strong accent she gives to time and space. She replaced brushes for brooms, canvas for floors and windows,  closed galleries for open rooms. Katharina doesn’t let her imaginations and projections to be controlled by anything, certainly not the limited scope. The only difference between the work in the studio and outside is time, the latter is done in a much more intensive and productive way. Regardless of the approaches and specifics that were used to produce each piece, they all have one thing in common, and that is the reflection of the artist thoughts and her view on the world. For Grosse, installations make mutually exclusive systems coexist.   Grosse’s impressive and large-scale work has taken galleries and site-specific installations around the world. In 2013 after the devastating Hurricane Sabrina, she used a palette of red, orange, and white color to paint an abandoned building that was a part of the ex-army base. This combination extended from interior walls and windows to roof and sand that surrounds it, blending it with clouds and creating an art installation. The show was located on the Rockaway Point Peninsula in New York. This idea was a result of the previous experience, when the artist did a similar thing with an abandoned house, destroyed during the Hurricane Kathrine in New Orleans in 2005. Her exquisite work provided her solo and group exhibitions in institutions around the globe. Author’s art appeared at the Arken - Museum of Modern Art, Copenhagen in 2009,  at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Cleveland in 2012, at the Sprengel Museum in Hannover, and many more. She was awarded with Oscar Schlemmer Prize in 2014, and Freid-Thieler-Preis, among others. In 2017 people will have an opportunity to see her work at Gagosian Gallery in New York.   ",1351
Joan Mitchell,"Joan Mitchell was a famous American painter and important member of the American abstract expressionism, despite the fact that much of her career took place in France. Just like her fellow artists Lee Krasner, Grace Hartigan and Helen Frankenthaler, Mitchell was one of her era's few female artists who gained a lot of public appreciation. She was a tough and disciplined person, always courageous and ready to sail against the wind in the masculine art world, at the time when no one believed that women could paint. I try to eliminate clichés, extraneous material. My painting is not an allegory or a story. It is more like a poem, said Joan Mitchell about her work. [1]  Joan Mitchell was born in Chicago in the mid-20s. Even though her parents weren’t visual artists, they were into fine arts and poetry. Her father was a physician who enjoyed drawing while her mother was a successful writer. The younger of two daughters, Joan grew up in a family where both art and literature were highly appreciated. She went to high school at Francis W. Parker School, which was a very progressive institution. After she graduated from high school, she enrolled at Smith College. Joan Mitchell also studied fine arts at the summer school organized by the Art Institute of Chicago. These summer lessons were held in Saugatuck, Michigan, where the young artist could enjoy an interesting mix of personal freedom and strict artistic guidance. Mitchell attended another summer school program in Guanajuato, Mexico, in the mid-40s. She proved to be an outstanding young artist and in 1947 she won a Ryerson Traveling Fellowship, which allowed her to visit New York and later on Europe. She lived in Europe for two years, from 1948 to 1950, when she decided to come back to the United States in order to marry Barney Rosset, a future publisher. They were both originally from Chicago, but they moved to New York City in the 1950s.   In 1950, the artist kept working on her education – she started taking courses at the prestigious Columbia University and NYU, in order to complete requirements needed for an MFA degree. Joan Mitchell befriended the circle of abstract expressionists as soon as she settled down in NYC and she started attending various events with them. For instance, she was a frequent visitor of Cedar Bar, a popular spot for aspiring creatives, and she also participated in important group exhibitions featuring abstract expressionists, such as the legendary 9th Street Show in 1951. Already a year later, in 1952, she had her first solo show, followed by another one in 1953, held at Stable Gallery. After the great initial success, Mitchell continued showcasing her works at Whitney Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in 1955. In 1957, Mitchell took part in one of the most important exhibitions in her career – it was called Artists of the New York School: Second Generation and it was held at the Jewish Museum. The term Second Generation was coined to describe creators such as Mitchell herself, Norman Bluhm, and Sam Francis, who were young painters all belonging to the same movement which resembled expressionism. When it comes to Mitchell's style in the mid and late 1950s, it was based on strong and rhythmical brushstrokes and her works were dynamic, bold and even impulsive. In 1959, Joan Mitchell came back to Europe and she opened a studio in France, located first in Rue Fremicourt in Paris before transferring to Vétheuil in 1968. Vétheuil is a small yet famous town in the French countryside, where the legendary impressionist Claude Monet worked in the 1880s. Mitchell has permanently moved to Vétheuil until her death in 1992.   Pop and conceptual art which were taking over abstract expressionism starting from the 60s didn’t prevent the artist from continuing to work in her own, independent style. During this revolutionary era, she kept exhibiting regularly in solo and group shows throughout the United States and France. In the 1980s, when the interest in conceptual art gradually diminished, Mitchell was discovered by a new generation of painters. She participated in the American Art Biennial Exhibition held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1983, with a group of popular young artists including big names such as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Julian Schnabel. She also took part in numerous annual shows at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C. and Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. Joan Mitchell's exploration of form and composition was rather refreshing as she expanded the previous expressionist tradition. Her bold colors and gestures created a uniquely compelling language, where ideas and feelings are represented through versatile patterns and shapes. Because of the tumultuous energy of her approach, Mitchell’s work has been often described by art critiques as truly breathtaking. Of all the museum retrospectives she had at the Whitney Museum, the one from 2002 was most memorable. It included a wide range of her paintings from different periods of her career, which allowed the viewers to fully understand Joan Mitchell’s artistic achievements.   Mitchell’s paintings can be found in various prestigious collections, including The Museum of Modern Art and The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and The Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois. There is also the Joan Mitchell Foundation, which was established in 1993 as a non-profit organization. This foundation is still active and it gives numerous awards, grants, and stipends to talented creatives. It is important to mention that already during her lifetime, Mitchell has achieved a lot of commercial success, more than any other female painter of the same generation. Between 1960 and 1962, she has earned over $30,000, while in 2007, the Art Institute of Chicago sold one of Mitchell’s work from 1957 at Christie's New York for astounding $3.8 million.[2]   Joan Mitchell was one of the rare women among the best-ranked abstract expressionists. She proved to be more successful than the majority of her male mentors and fellow painters, with Lee Krasner being her only female rival.[3] Even though she was well-received by the most influential critics and artists, her great achievements didn’t receive full recognition during her lifetime. For instance, her paintings haven’t been shown in New York City for roughly 20 years, because of her different style which made it even harder for her to excel in the art world led primarily by male creators. Throughout her life, the artist was deeply committed to autonomous abstract works, which allowed her to express her immense love for the craft and technique of contemporary painting. The artist is represented by Hauser & Wirth, Weng Contemporary and Woodward Gallery. Joan Mitchell died on October 30, 1992. Sources: ",1352
Janet Fish,"Revitalizing the traditional genre of still life, Janet Fish creates impressive pieces that reveal the formal and conceptual potentials of the unexpected and often ironic blend of different common objects seen in changing lights. Her intensely colored canvases consist of precisely arranged various items, from glass bowls with fruit, vases with vivid exotic flowers, rugs, and textiles, to flea market finds. Rarely daring to include the human figure, Fish’s genre scenes represent the true delight for the viewer’s eyes with its playful and active subjects, masterly incorporated into the festive surroundings. Attempting to capture the movement of light, energy, and warmth, this American painter produces harmonious and often fairly large in scale compositions. Her command of the arrangement of elements of color can be seen even more clearly in her graphic work.   Influenced by representational artists such as Fairfield Porter and Alex Katz, during her studies Fish was not always encouraged in her realistic approach, considering the fact that prestigious university’s art programs advocated the idea of inferiority of the figurative painting in relation to abstraction or conceptual work. Not finding personal and creative satisfaction in Abstract Expressionism, her wish to teach art at the college level was also hampered by the male faculty who suggested she apply to teach at a girl’s school. It was then she decided to move to New York, which proved to be a good idea – her works were accepted with a great reception and she became a part of the local art scene. Her paintings from that period of late 60’s and early 70’s are mainly studies of transparent objects and represent the beginnings of her exploration of nature and essence of light that will occupy her attention throughout her career[2]. Adopting the common, but unexpected objects such as fruits in the supermarket cellophane packages or glasses filled with liquids, the real meaning of her works were revealed in her process of the tone, gesture, color, light, scale, and composition. During the 70’s she made her compositions more complex and six-month stay in Vermont in 1978 influenced her to pay more attention to still lifes, the human figure and to transform her landscapes into complicated play of color, light and shadows. Pieces like Afternoon Reflections, June and September (1978) announce her later vibrant artworks. Showing the reflection of her indoor and outdoor domestic life, Fish’s visual language could be perceived as the one of Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot. Speaking of historical references, still life genre has always been in a connection to various metaphysical concerns and symbolical meanings, but in the case of this artist maybe there’s no need to search for hidden stories behind, but indulge to pure visual satisfaction and feast for the eyes. She began from the simple explorations of clear glassware and its transparency and reflection and over the time her depictions were developed into complex and powerful representations characterized by pictorial movement around the canvas and more and more intense, harmoniously and precisely arranged colors. Like in the jigsaw puzzle, every tiny spot of the paint has its determined place. The masterful process of formal elements separates this artist from the other contemporary still life painters, placing Fish closer to the Impressionist’s use of broken color with the aim of building forms. Although sometimes considered as photorealistic and associated with the New realism, her work is only a reproduction of the world she sees through the elements of painting, not photography. Her subjects are color, light, movement, and space and the content is a life itself and its unusual juxtapositions of isolated moments are just a mean that she uses to express her technical skills. Highlighting the spatial depth, Fish often changes the importance of the foreground and background which results with unexpected spatial effects like in the painting Dog Days (1993) where the figure of the dog seems smaller than the watermelon pieces on the table in the foreground. The use of transparent materials offers her the possibility to emphasize the depth and volumes without traditional ways, such as chiaroscuro[3].   Affected by feminist ideas that were widely represented during the late 1960’s, when the only few women taught in college art departments and rarely exhibit in museums and galleries, Janet Fish pierced through the male’s world where people even believed in different aesthetic approach depending on the sex. The masterful processing of the formal elements in her work, whether it is painting or lithograph print, provides and affirmation of life and reveals the truth about enjoyment and appreciation of the “small” things that makes our world. Often praised by critics as the painter whose still lifes revived realism in the 1970’s, Fish has always followed her instincts that separated her from the popular Abstract Expressionist’s stream that evidently showed as a good decision. Besides her successful artistic career and opulent oeuvre, she has been simultaneously dedicated to her teaching call, working as an art instructor at the School of Visual Arts and Parsons the New School for Design in New York, the Syracuse University and at the University of Chicago.

Igor Mitoraj,"Igor Mitoraj was a famous Polish sculptor who drew inspiration from the concept of broken beauty. His pieces, similar to the works of the old Roman and Greek culture, are fragmented, with a certain postmodern feel. They make us think about the damage inflicted on the antique statues by the passing of time. His works are prevalently large-scale and made in marble, terracotta or bronze. Mitoraj’s sculptures have the greatest impact when combined with a certain setting - the artist was particularly fond of the Meditteranean landscapes.  Igor Mitoraj was born in the mid-40s in Oederan, Germany. In 1963, he moved from Germany to Poland and enrolled at the Krakow Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied painting and was tutored by Tadeusz Kantor, the famous Polish painter. Mitoraj had his first solo exhibition in Krakow in 1967, just a year before he moved to Paris to continue his education in fine arts. I started with painting but I felt a constant need for the third dimension, the artist claimed in one of his interviews. He was an adventurous soul and he traveled to exotic places whenever he had a chance to do so. During the early 70, when he visited Mexico, he became impressed by Latin American art, particularly their huge, epic statues. They were beautiful and foreboding at the same time and after the artist had returned to Paris in 1974, he started creating sculptural pieces which he exhibited at Gallery La Hune. The exhibition was a great success and it encouraged Mitoraj to seriously pursue the medium of sculpture.   Mitoraj was initially working with terracotta and bronze but after his trip to Italy in 1979, he started uusing marble as his primary medium. In 1983, seduced by the charms of Italy and especially Rome, he set up his studio in Pietrasanta. Mitoraj's sculptural style is based on the classical tradition and focused on the well-modelled torso. However, his pieces are not entirely inspired by the classical Roman and Greek tradition – he introduced an interesting post-modern twist into his pieces. They have truncated limbs, which emphasize the damage sustained by the majority of antique pieces. Mitoraj was extremely gifted when it comes to finding a right anatomical part in order to make a decisive visual statement. I feel that a piece of arm or a leg speak far more strongly than a whole body, the artist said. However, the reason why his works are fragmented or seem damaged is not only to mimic the ravages of time – the artist also underlines that the modern times we’re living in inflict a strong damage on human soul, because of the isolation and the lack of basic human contact. Some of his sculptures are blindfolded, which is a great metaphor for our isolation and loneliness.   Mitoraj was an extremely busy and prolific artist – in addition to his exhibitions, he worked on many commissions, especially in Italy and Poland. He was invited to the 42nd Venice Art Biennale in 1986, and during the 1980s and 1990s he had many solo and group shows throughout Europe and America. The solemnity of his pieces fits well within various religious environments and he was commissioned to create bronze doors at the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rome, in 2006, and also at the Maria Boska Laskawa Church in Warsaw, in 2009. Mitoraj’s works are now the part of the prestigious gallery, museum and private collections, such as Coca-Cola Foundation in Atlanta , Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield. The artist has won the Golden Medal for Merit to Culture in 2005 and the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 2012. He died in Paris, France, in October 2014.   Mitoraj was deeply dedicated to his work and he continued to exhibit until the very end of his life. The concept of broken beauty was his lifetime muse, the very center of his entire artistic world. My work is an example of this dichotomy: mesmerizing perfection attached to corrupted imperfection, Mitoraj has cleverly described the bottom line of his creative processes. His work contains a unique nostalgic appeal that managed to bring together the rigorous antique tradition and the dark decay of postmodernism. Igor Mitoraj lived and worked between Poland, Italy and France. ",1354
Wolfgang Tillmans,"Every once in a while comes a true visionary. An individual capable of changing the old ways and establishing the new ones. Wolfgang Tillmans is one of the world’s most influential contemporary photographers. His work addresses his own life, the world around him, his political and social concerns, but also the entire history of the medium he’d chosen to express himself through. He earned his popularity and recognition with images portraits of the youth culture, and since the late ‘90s, his attention towards the abstraction has grown significantly. These images, produced directly in a darkroom and often without a camera, have marked the second part of his immensely successful career. Always centered on one the hardest questions of them all – the question of identity, Tillmans is more than interested to discover Who he is?, but also Who we are?  Born in Remscheid in the German area of Bergisches Land[1], Tillmans had a relatively early introduction to serious art. Growing up, all the art that seemed to have touched him was lens-generated. Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Robert Rauschenberg, and Andy Warhol were the first masters he saw in the Museum Ludwig in Cologne and in Düsseldorf when he was 14 years old. He was also inspired by Dada and Kurt Schwitters, a big passion of his at the time. The pieces that particularly touched him were made out of cut-up newspapers.[2] As an exchange student, he first visited the UK in 1983 and that’s when he discovered the British youth culture and the local fashion and music magazines of the time. He lived in Hamburg from 1987-1990. There he started producing work – his first images were torn from newspaper and reproduced on a digital photocopier, enlarging them up to 400%. As a gay teenager growing up in the ‘80s, he identified with the music of that time in a profound way. Becoming a part of the club scene, he used a cheap camera that he’d bought to take club pictures which he would send to i-D, where they were published.  In 1990, Tillmans returned to Britain and began a two-year course at Bournemouth College of Art and Design before moving to London after studies. His talent was evident, his interest in storytelling beyond compare. His friend often served as his models. In 1992, Tillmans took a group of images that are arguably his best-known works - Lutz and Alex sitting in the trees, Lutz and Alex holding cock, Lutz and Alex holding each other. The two models, Lutz and Alex, were photographer’s oldest friends who, like their names, were androgynous and sometimes difficult to tell apart. The artist showed these images to Maureen Paley, a London gallery owner, who decided to show them at Unfair, a fair for emerging young creative individuals. After the fair in Cologne in 1992, things were happening rather quickly for Tillmans. He received an almost worldwide gallery representation and made his first book, published in 1993. In 2000, he became a first winner of the Turner Prize working predominantly in photography. The first damaged and abstract pictures were exhibited in 1998 and other works from that time reflect the reaction of the photographic paper to light, as well as mechanical and chemical processes. From 2000 onwards, Tillmans has become increasingly interested in the chemical foundations of photographic material, as well as its haptic and spatial possibilities.   In 1995, the artist was invited to participate in an exhibition at Serpentine Gallery in London. The show, curated by Hans-Ulrich Obrist, promoted as a new way to make art accessible by removing the barriers between exhibition and mass consumption, it was criticized for turning art into a ""jumble sale"". Fifteen years later, Obrist, now co-director of exhibitions, has invited Tillmans to install a new solo show, taking over the entire gallery. This exhibition, conceived especially for the Serpentine Gallery, emphasizes the artist’s ongoing fascination with color, his conceptual engagement with the technical processes of photography, and as always, his acute sensitivity to the contemporary world around him. Tillmans’ abstractions, that have pushed the boundaries and definitions of the photographic form, are placed alongside his once again sharp focus on the figurative. Prior to the show, the photographer renewed the figurative focus by some of his color-saturated works and experiments with the process. As always, the exhibiting photographic practice has been challenged through the never-ending play with various methods, where Tillmans often pins or taps his work to gallery walls, creating constellations of pictures. By doing this, he’s trying to approximate the way that he sees the world, not in a linear order but as a multitude of parallel experiences.[3]   In 2010, the artist continued his series of successful exhibitions by showing his work at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.[4]  His work was installed along with some of the museum’s greatest treasures, creating an unlikely bond (only on a first sight) and making the show quite impressive and unique. Even though Tillmans’ subject matter for this show parallels traditional genres (emphasizing portraits, landscapes, interiors, still life, but also gestural abstraction and the monochrome), he made the viewers aware of the physical quality of the photographs. The chemical foundations of the photographic medium have been at the top of his interests since 2000, and these abstract works, created without a camera, are once again exhibited next to the figurative photographs. Pieces chosen for this show and the way they were hanged are all a precisely considered exercise, meant to connect the masterpieces already exhibited in the museum with the photographer’s own work. Faltenwurf (Morgen) II 2009 represents a bridge between the figurative and pure abstraction. Par monochrome, part still life, almost a portrait, the photograph focuses on discarded clothes over the back and seat of a chair (continuing his clothes surface, colors and signs of wear ‘fetishes’). At Walker, Tillmans has chosen to hang the work so as to emphasize its relationship to the depiction of sumptuous drapery in the adjacent paintings by Reynolds and his contemporaries, showing sensuality in what might appear rather formal 18th-century portraits. Beerenstilleben 2007 (a still-life), located so characteristically on a windowsill, features the vernacular debris of 21st-century life: plastic food containers alongside a solitary, leftover almond and the more symbolic burned down candle that might have appeared in the Dutch still lifes of the 17th century as a reminder of mortality. Tillmans’ awareness for the fragility of human life is high, as is his desire to celebrate it. All the works have been carefully selected, and compliment the already existing artworks on display.    In his latest solo exhibition, Tillmans thematizes his own place of production.[5] Taking a form of an inventory, the exhibition is not a peek behind the scenes, but rather an attempt to create a cartographical representation of what this space and its constituents mean to the photographer. The word itself suggests a spectrum of destinations that come to mind when thinking about a studio – there’s a darkroom, a place for manual production, a testing ground in which different practices are carried out (they are close to each other, and he can observe the effects closely and make comparisons), a viewing space, an archive. Without any elaborately staged backdrop or lighting equipment ever to be seen, the studio (filled with bookshelves, CDs and records, artworks, furniture, archive boxes) appears frequently as background in Tillmans’ portraits, and he has been a keen observer of the place's role in his work. As an artist, he spends the vast majority of the time at his studio, and the place inevitably got to the point where it bears the signature of the artist’s inclinations, his daily routine, and the people who surround him. Speaking of his studios, Tillmans has also hosted a number of events which led to the opening of an exhibition space called Between Bridges in 2006. Run by the artist himself, it was first located at the entrance and stairwell of his London studio on Cambridge Heath Road. Now it has been relocated to Keithstrasse in Berlin.   Photography is very unique. Due to its process, many ask questions like, “What does the photographer bring to the picture? What personal history, what politics, biases, or obsessions?” The artist admits it’s a challenge he’s always taken. He wants the pictures to be working in both directions. He accepts that they speak about him, and yet at the same time, he wants and expects them to function in terms of the viewer and their experience.[6] If the photography is the chosen medium, then some embarrassments are unavoidable. Tillmans states that his “ultimate, ultimate truth is that ultimately I don’t know. People pretend that they do. My fundamental understanding is that I might always be wrong. I may be assured or confident, but I could always be wrong.”[7] He simply doesn’t fear failing, and it’s without a doubt one his biggest strengths. However, it is important to emphasize that his success should not be mistaken for certainty – about anything. There is always an inherent sense of doubt and uncertainty about the identity present in the people the photographer feels touched by or who interest him. The question of identity is truly a powerful one, and Tillmans has spent his entire career trying to find an answer. He is represented by David Zwirner.  Sources:  ",1355
Lee Ufan,"Korean painter, sculptor, and philosopher Lee Ufan became famous in the late 1960s as one of the main representatives of the Japanese avant-garde movement Mono-ha. This important movement, which gained a lot of international recognition, rejected Western concepts of representation and focused on the relationships between materials and perception. The main goal of Mono-ha was to embrace the peaceful coexistence of numerous beings, concepts, and experiences, which is evident in Lee Ufan’s paintings and sculptures. As a writer, Ufan has expressed the artistic concepts in Japan during the late 60s and he posed some truly fundamental questions, such as - what does it mean to produce a work of art at the end of the twentieth century? [1]  Lee Ufan was born in 1936, in South Kyongsang province in Korea. He was interested in fine arts since his early childhood and he decided to enroll at the College of Fine Arts at Seoul National University. However, painting wasn’t his only passion – young Ufan was equally fascinated by philosophy, which made him move to Yokohama, Japan in 1956, where he studied philosophy at Nihon University. Since Ufan continued his education in Japan, he started painting in a traditional Japanese style while studying philosophy. When it comes to the contemporary Japanese Gutai school which was popular at the time, Ufan wasn’t interested in this form of expressive abstraction. In the late 1960s, the artist became an important member of the avant-garde Mono-ha movement which abandoned the typical Western practices of media manipulation in order to explore the depth of the relationship between various things and their surroundings. Moho-ha members often used raw physical materials in their work and their minimalism was an expression of de-westernization and de-modernisation, typical for the postwar Japanese society.   In the early 70s, for the occasion of Paris Youth Biennale, Mono-ha was introduced to Europe and this led to international recognition of Ufan’s artworks. Around the same time, he has opened his own studio in Paris. After Mono-ha became more popular in Europe, it became evident that it has a lot in common with Arte Povera, which also concentrates on the use of natural and found materials. When it comes to the nature of Lee Ufan’s work, it revolves around austere simplicity, minimalism and philosophical points of view. His abstract brushstrokes offer a unique perspective on the very nature of painting process and the same goes for his sculptures which investigate the very essence of steel and large stone pieces. One of the artist’s most famous series is called Relatum and it portrays the interaction between space and objects while simultaneously engaging the viewers in contemplation about the meaning of art. In 1991, he began his another iconic series called Correspondance, which consist of simple grey or blue brushstrokes applied onto a pristine white surface.   Lee Ufan had a long and prosperous career when it comes to academic jobs as well - he worked as a professor at Tama Art University in Tokyo for more than 30 years. In the meantime, his artworks became a part of the prestigious permanent collection at the Hiroshima City Museum and he participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions, including important shows at New York Pace Wildenstein and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.[2] Lee Ufan’s first solo exhibition was held in Japan in 1967 and after this successful debut, he was invited to participate in Documenta VI show in Kassel, Germany and in the Bienal de São Paulo. In 1997, Ufan had a major solo exhibit at the Jeu de Paume Paris, while in 2001 the Kunstmuseum Bonn held an important retrospective of his works. His most notable success happened during 2007 Venice Biennale, when his Resonance exhibition became widely appraised by both critiques and audience. Nowadays, Ufan's paintings sell for six-figure sums at auctions. For example, his work from 1984 featuring a series of blue lines was sold for $410,000 at Sotheby's in New York.    Ufan’s minimalist installations and sculptures which emphasize the relationship between the artworks, the viewer, and the space seem timeless in their simplicity and universal appeal. The same goes for his paintings, which resemble Asian calligraphy because of the interplay of bold line strokes and plain backgrounds. Ufan was honoured for having contributed to the development of contemporary art in Japan, which speaks about the extraordinary importance and quality of his pieces.[3] The artist is represented by Pace Gallery Beijing, Pace Gallery Hong Kong, Pace Gallery London, Pace Gallery Menlo Park and Scai the Bathhouse Tokyo.

Komar and Melamid,"Komar and Melamid is an tandem team of Russian conceptualist artists Vitaly Komar, born in 1943 and Alexander Melamid, born in 1945. They attended and graduated from the Stroganov School of Art and Design in 1967. Both artists were born in Moscow, but emigrated to Israel in 1977 and subsequently to New York in 1978. In an artists’ statement they said that “even if only one of us creates some of the projects and works, we usually sign them together. We are not just an artist, we are a movement.” Their first joint show, Retrospectivism, appeared in the Blue Bird Cafe, Moscow, in 1967. During the late 60’s and early 70’s, Komar and Melamid found the movement that they called Sots Art, a unique version of Soviet Pop and Conceptual Art, which combines the principles of Dadaism and Socialist Realism. During these years, they also worked on Post-Art, pioneering multi-stylistical images prescient of post-modernism, which would become popular in the 80’s. They collaborated on various conceptual projects, ranging from painting and performance to installation, public sculpture, photography, music, and poetry. They also collaborated with other artists, for example, Douglas Davis, Fluxus member Charlotte Moorman, Andy Warhol, among others. In 1973, they were expelled from the Youth section of the Soviet Artist Union. In 1974, duo was arrested during a performance in a Moscow apartment show and later their works, along with the works of other nonconformist artists, were destroyed by Soviet authorities at the open-door “Bulldozer Show.” In 1978, they moved to New York. Their first show in the West was at the Feldman Gallery, NY, in 1976, and first individual museum show was at the Hartford Athenaeum, Harford, USA, in 1978. In the 80’s, they continued developing their Sots Art in works such as Nostalgic Socialist Realism Series, May 1st Installation at the Palladium Disco, and also Post-Art in works such as Diary Series, Anarchistic Synthesis Series, Bayonne, N.J. Series. They were the first Russian artists to receive funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, and also the first Russian artists to be invited to the Documenta 8, in Kassel, Germany, in 1987. They devoted their projects in the 90’s to iconoclasm, democracy and elitism by statistics and ecology. Komar and Melamid’s most recent projects are devoted to art as a religion and to the synthesis of irony and spirituality. They can be found in Oxford’s Dictionary of 20th Century Art, The Penguin Concise Dictionary of Art History, Art Since the 40’s, Bildende Kunst im 20 Jahrhundert, and Phaidon’s The 20th–Century Art Book. Their works are included in the collections of Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and  Museum of Modern Art in New York, Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Albertina, Vienna, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, and San Francisco Museum of Art. In 2004 the creative union of Komar and Melamid disbanded.",1357
Peter Halley,"American artist Peter Halley is best known for his Day-Glo paintings featuring geometric compositions, which he has named ""cells"" and ""prisons"". In his work belonging to the Neo-Conceptualist movement, the artist explores the relationship between color fields and rectangular forms. Halley is also a successful writer and an author of several critical theory essays, including Robert Smithson, Beat, New Wave, and Minimalism. Today the artist's work, which has been sold in auction for up to six-figure prices, can be found in a number of private and public collections, including the Tate Museum in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago.   Halley, born in 1953 in New York, studied for two years at Yale University and left for the University of New Orleans after being denied entry to arts major. In 1978 he graduated from New Orleans's university with an MFA and decided to travel for a while across Mexico, Europe, and North Africa. After returning to New York, Halley fell in love with its three-dimensional urban grid, which became the primary source of inspiration for his geometric abstractions. The same way streets connect different parts of the city, thus in Halley's paintings, his 'prisons' and 'cells' are connected by straight lines he calls 'conduits'. Together with Philip Taaffe and Ashley Bickerton, Halley, with his work, defined the Neo-Geo Movement whose themes critique the utopian vision of avant-garde idealists. Peter Halley said:   Halley is inspired by the works of masters, such as Donald Judd, Josef Albers, and Piet Mondrian. In his work, a theme of alienation is prevalent, touching on complex subjects such as living in the city and relationships with technology. The paintings are a metaphor for contemporary society with all its good and bad sides. In later years his work became more complex. The artist works with industrial Roll-a-Tex, which he applies with a roller. His paintings have no visible paint brush strokes, no matter how big or small the prisons and cells might be. In the 1990s, the artist began creating site-specific installations for public places, galleries, and museums. Their interaction with surrounding architecture was made possible through the mix of fiberglass relief sculptures, flowcharts, and paintings.   Peter Halley's first solo exhibition was at the International with Monument gallery in 1985. Since then, he has had numerous exhibitions, including Peter Halley: The Early Paintings at Lopez de La Serna Contemporary Arts Center in Madrid (2022), PETER HALLEY: NEW PAINTINGS at Galeria Millan in São Paulo, Brazil (2021), and Peter Halley: Networks at James Barron Art in Kent, CT (2020). The artist's latest installations are INTERACTION at Fondazione Made in Cloister, Naples (2022), and CELL GRIDS at Dallas Contemporary in Dallas, TX (2021). Peter Halley lives and works in New York.

Jack Pierson,"An American photographer, sculptor, and draftsman, Jack Pierson is exceptionally prolific and comfortable working with a variety of media. His subjects are drawn mostly from his daily life as a contemporary artist, capturing fragments of urban landscapes, still lives of ordinary objects, homoerotic nudes, and evocative words worked into collages or transformed into neons. Born in 1960 in Plymouth, MA, Pierson received a BFA from the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, MA, in 1984. He is associated with the Boston School, referring to a group of photographers who worked in Boston in the early 1980s, centering on photographing their mutual friends in intimate or casual settings. His work is included in a range of public collections, including the Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 2004, his Self-Portrait series was part of the Whitney Biennial. While his photographic works have often been compared to images from American road movies, the artist seeks to explore the flip side of the concept of the American Dream, searching to express what he calls ""the tragedy inherent in the pursuit of glamour."" His works are often imbued with a sense of longing, loss, melancholy, and disillusionment. ",1359
Romero Britto,"Praised for the vibrancy and enthusiasm of his paintings, Miami-based Romero Britto works in a unique visual vocabulary based on the assumption that art and artists have a duty of being agents of positive change. Over the course of his career, Britto developed a distinct, pop-cubist style characterized by bold colors, playful themes and abstractions that imply on the legacy of artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Romero's fantastic art is a testimony of Miami's vitality and South American cultures, presenting the viewers with an amazing world revolving around humor, popular aesthetics and a complete lack of any restraints.  Since he was growing up in a very poor situation, Romero Britto and his seven brothers were forced to make due with what they had. Observed from today's standpoint, Britto feels that art is what kept him away from all the dark circumstances of his childhood, re-focusing his attention on the bright colors and positive aspects of life. When he was at the early age of fourteen, Britto presented his creations to the public for the very first time at an exhibition arranged by the Organization of American States. Despite winning awards for his displayed works and being encouraged by this early success, Britto felt that a smarter move for him at that time was seeking a practical, academic path as this would be a more realistic course. Soon after, he received a scholarship to study law at the Catholic University of Pernambuco. However, after he entered his third semester, Britto had a change of heart - he realized that nothing he learned so far made him as happy as creating his early pieces of art did. Keeping that in mind, Romero packed his bags and set sails for Europe in order to study and paint.  After arriving at the Old Continent in 1989, Britto’s art was distinguished almost immediately for its positive and energetic view on life[1], obviously channeled from his early childhood. Since then, Romero's unmistakably modern colorful work is easily recognized without much effort. Interestingly, Britto started to combine artistic techniques of Pop Art and the complex qualities of Cubism, making his work extremely unique and stunning. In the early stage of his career, Romero explored several artistic mediums including watercolor, pencil and ink, serigraphy, lithography, acrylic and even finger paint - all that mattered to the young painter was that his visuals follow his Pop-Cubism visual guideline.  After he managed to establish himself as a world-class talent, Britto started sporadically working for institutions and organizations such as  St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, the American Red Cross, and Best Buddies International. Firms were literally lining up in order to hire Romero. Additionally, Britto attended major art fairs such as FIAC Paris and Art Salon Hong Kong, as well as numerous world tours. His colorful works were extremely popular from the moment they appeared at the scene, finding their way into some of the most prestigious collections in the world. Wishing to become a bigger part of the United States scene, Britto moved to Miami, Florida, the city which serves as his home to this day. There, the artist continued to evolve creatively and his Neo-Pop style became a true sensation. Exhibitions of his work were everywhere between New York and Tokyo. His paintings were also quite popular with celebrities or renowned figures from our societies, some of which he has based portraits on, like the case was with Roger Federer, Dustin Hoffman, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Jordan, Gloria Estefan, Andre Agassi, Eileen Guggenheim, David Rockefeller and Senator Ted Kennedy. Simultaneously alluding to influences of early and modern masters, Britto’s constantly pulsating colors, pop themes and commanding compositions have led him to become one of the premier Brazilian contemporary artists of his generation.  It should also be noted that Britto’s constant charitable contributions and activities have helped with establishing his reputation. Whether it be helping to protect and preserve the Brazilian rainforest, assisting the mentally ill or funding research for AIDS, Romero dedicated much of his time to such endeavors. That trait of his personality was eventually crowned in a form of the Britto Foundation, an organization founded in the year of 2007. The idea behind this Miami-based company was and still is to promote education and humanitarian initiatives for children. Furthermore, the Britto Foundation aims to nurture young people’s art and cultural aspirations, engage children in literacy programs and respond to the needs of those within the most vulnerable populations.    With his never-ending positive energy, Britto continues to fulfill his dreams to this day. It is rather safe to say that Romero is rightfully considered to be the youngest and most successful Brazilian Neo-Pop artist of his generation[2]. Through his unique visuals, Romero Britto creates a completely new expression that reflects his optimistic faith in the world around him. This always was and always will be his main goal as an artist. The painter explained it best himself when he stated the following: As an artist, I feel lucky to have been given the gift of creativity so that I may share my vision of a better world. I will never forget what it was like to be poor and that is why it is so important to me that my work be accessible to all people. For me, art can reflect the celebration of the simple and good things in life. This is the most important to me. With such goals, we hope that Romero will stay committed to developing and supporting the powerful role art often plays in many of the world's issues. This artist is represented by Gerard Seiwert Gallery.  References:   ",1360
Louise Nevelson,"One of the most prominent American female sculptors of the 20th century, Louise Nevelson emerged in the art world during the dominance of Abstract Expressionism. Incorporating the wooden objects found at the urban debris piles into her most iconic works, she created the monumental installations that resembled the most Marcel Duchamp’s readymades. The main characteristic of her work is that her subject matter includes her personal feelings about an unrooted childhood when she had to leave The Soviet Union and move to America, the clashing cultures and nature’s magnificence. Carefully selected and arranged rejected objects get the new meaning and form a narrative context. During her career, Nevelson developed the affinity toward new materials and her later sculptures, mostly intended for outdoor environments had a more geometric form and were made of industrial materials as Cor-Ten steel.   Born as Leah Berliawsky on September 23, 1899, in Kiev, Ukraine, Nevelson spent her childhood up in Rockland, Maine, after arriving in the United States at a young age because of the Jewish origins of her family. Living with the parents with the progressive views (her father was a lawyer who fought for women’s rights and mother was also a freethinker), she always knew that she wants to be an artist. In 1920, Nevelson changed her name and moved with her husband to New York city. Eleven years later she separated from her husband and in 1932 traveled to Europe to study, but returned to America as the political situation in Germany worsened. Enrolling the sculpture at the Art Students League, an art school where Jackson Pollock and other Abstract Expressionists studied, during the time, her reputation started to grow.    Employed by the Works Progress Administration, Nevelson assisted Diego Rivera on his mural Portrait of America. In the 40’s she began to experiment with various media, using the wood and junk she found on the streets of New York and creating the assemblages of it. Changing the style too, her palette became monochrome, with the domination of the black paint. In the late 50’s her works were featured at the Museum of Modern art, and later on, she became more and more successful when other big museums and collectors recognized her talent. Throughout 70’s and 80’s Nevelson created several large installations among which is the most famous imprint on New York – The Louise Nevelson Plaza in lower Manhattan.   Nevelson was an extravagant person, standing out with her glamorous gowns, heavy face makeup and unconventional hairstyles. But essentially, she lived simply and worked into her 80’s, never hesitating from a challenge. She distinguished as a successful female figure in a stereotypical male sculptor’s profession and her work inspired numerous young artists, primarily those involved in installation art and Feminist movements. Louise Nevelson passed away of natural causes, on April 17, 1988, in New York. Just before she died, she had finished a 35-foot sculpture installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.  ",1361
Matteo Negri,"Matteo Negri is an Italian visual artist, recognized for creating various works of art. He concentrates his artistic research on different materials as marble, ceramic and resin, mixing them with a pop range of hues as an expressive instrument. Matteo Negri was born in 1982 in Milan, where he graduated at the Brera Academy with a degree in sculpture. After graduating at the Academy of Fine Arts in 2003, the artist created numerous installations for exhibitions at art galleries, public spaces and art fairs in Italy and abroad, including Paris and Berlin. Negri first dedicated himself to a project called Mines, based on a subversion of the idea of objects, splitting form and meaning. Using real, decommissioned bombs, depth-charges and mines, he explores how bright colors and unexpected settings can turn a destructive weapon into something resembling a large gemstone. The giant reproduction of objects moves the attention of the spectator from the real use to the aesthetic seduction coming out of the single pieces. This clear split between form and meaning is also something one sees elsewhere in popular culture, where clever marketing can turn any given products into curious objects of desire. The artist gained international recognition in 2008, when he started doing Lego art, his most successful project. The bricks are reconstructed on a big scale using it as an archetype symbol of creativity. The Lego becomes an art piece for the conversion of acquired values. Through modifications and manipulations the brick is not a shape anymore, but becomes a metaphor of subjectivity and children’s inherent desire to build and create their own personalities. Process of making his artworks is sometimes unusual and unconventional, such as when children took part in a game of ‘building constructions’, to create a giant cardboard Lego structure, which is then painted and looks like a Mondrian artwork. From 2003 he has worked in Italy and abroad with different galleries. He also realized numerous works for public areas, private foundations, art galleries and art fairs in Paris, London and Berlin. Matteo Negri has had several gallery and museum exhibitions, and his works are often sold at various auctions. Matteo Negri currently lives and works in Milan.   ",1362
Lynda Benglis,"Lynda Benglis is an American sculptor and visual artist, considered as a pioneer of a form of abstraction in which each work is the result of materials in action, creating sculptures that eschew minimalist reserve in favor of bold colors, sensual lines, and lyrical references to the human body. Lynda Benglis was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana in 1941. She earned a BFA in 1964 from Newcomb College in New Orleans, which was then the women's college of Tulane University. In 1964, Benglis moved to New York, where she studied painting at the Brooklyn Museum Art School. Counting Andy Warhol, Sol LeWitt and Barnett Newman among her friends and peers, Benglis established her career within a male-dominated art world and became famous not only for her radical re-envisioning of sculpture and painting through her early works using wax and poured latex, but also for her works dealing with feminist politics and self-image. Like other female artists, she was attracted by the newness of a medium that was uncorrupted by male artists. The structure of the new medium itself played an important role in addressing questions about female identity in relation to art, pop culture, and dominant feminism movements at the time. Lynda Benglis's work has always been the result of a fluid and organic working process, in which difficult-to-control materials help determine the final outcome. Her early works include wax paintings and a series of Fallen Paintings, which she created by pouring colored latex onto the floor. Benglis’s range of sculptural materials expanded to include polyurethane foam, cast aluminum, bronze, and plaster. In the 1970s, she produced a series of Torsos, cast aluminum shells that jut out from the wall, and Knots, brightly colored ribbons that resemble human figures in motion. She has also produced work in video and photography, including a controversial advertisement in the 1974 issue of Artforum, which showed the artist posing nude in a provocative manner. Benglis seeks to challenge a male-dominated discourse in art by creating work that is sensual, body-oriented, and decorative. Known for her exploration of metaphorical and biomorphic shapes, she is deeply concerned with the physicality of form and how it affects the viewer, using a wide range of materials to render dynamic impressions of mass and surface - soft becomes hard, hard becomes soft and gestures are frozen. In more recent works, she explores diverse cultural heritages like Indian architecture, Greek statuary, and Chinese ceramics, translating ancient techniques and symbols for use in contemporary contexts. Her work has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, France, among many other prestigious venues. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and two National Endowment for the Arts grants, among other commendations. Lynda Benglis currently resides in New York, Santa Fe, and Ahmedabad, India.",1363
Joseph Cornell,"Joseph Cornell was an American artist who pioneered the art of boxed assemblage. Along with the collage assemblage, he made the experimental avant-garde film, influenced by surrealism and pop art. Cornell led a peculiar life, spending most of his time inside his home where he grew up. Being very introverted and self-conscious, he did not like to go out much or to meet other people, yet somehow he managed to account Andy Warhol, Rothko, and many other famous artists from the mid 20 century. Staying cornered in a house, he managed to find the portal to infinity inside his boxes.  Joseph Cornell was born in Nyack, New York, in 1903. He had two sisters and a brother. His family was a typical middle-class family, his father was a textile salesman, and his mother was a preschool teacher. After his father suddenly passed away in 1917, his poverty-stricken family had to move to the district of Queens. Cornell attended the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, but soon returned home. Since then, he never ever left New York. He was very close with his brother, Robert, who had cerebral palsy. He and Joseph spent almost every moment of their lives together. Cornell felt comfortable in his house, but he had to go outside to work, so that was the reason to despise his merchant job even more. While he was employed, he found a new joy and excitement in visiting the city museums, flea markets where he purchased interesting memorabilia and random objects that fascinated him. Along with the museums, galleries, and open markets, Cornell visited bookshops and Opera. He started making a big collection of his found objects, from paper cutouts to old tickets, sea shells, pinecones, plastic, and glass. His fascination with the opera, especially ballerinas, later had quite an influence on his artwork. He admired female power and befriended many ballerinas and actresses. Also, many of his business partners later in life were female. Unfortunately, his shyness kept him away from romance.   Cornell never learned how to draw and paint, and when he discovered what surrealism is, during the 1930's he decided that he can also pursue art. To be able to express himself, an artist can create and chose his own medium, that was the philosophy of surrealism and Cornell's guiding idea. He improvised his studio, at first a kitchen table at his home in Utopia Parkway, and worked with glue, scissors, and paper, mostly at night. His first artworks were collages, that were done in a form of paper archives, similar to the what we today call portfolio. There was one with ballerinas, one with butterflies, cyclists, food, bugs and other animals. He called his paper files, part art, part categorization. Soon after mastering the collage, he turned to experimental avant-garde film and his first shadow boxes. He was completely self-taught and knew nothing about the art world, yet his films were very popular. His films were even reviewed in artistic, Surrealist and Dada, magazines at the time. His first shadow box Soap Bubble Set was exhibited at the MOMA in 1936, as part of the Surrealist and Dada exhibition. Even though he was very shy and completely introverted, he liked that his work was praised and well accepted by art critiques and fellow artist. He continued to communicate with all of them, for the business reasons, even though he found it hard to stay so open.   After the first success, he decided to resign from his sales job and to open a real studio this time in his basement. There he started making many shadow boxes, and he started constructing the frames himself. He became very skillful with power tools, wood cutting procedures, and he used lots of paint, lacquer, and colors. His assemblages, the shadow boxes, carried a strange Victorian energy. They completely captivated the viewer, bearing a feeling of nostalgia. They recall childhood memories, bringing the mixture of sadness and joy. Cornell was a real magician in finding the exact right object to go with the story of the box. All that hoarding, and sorting out the found objects, turned out to be very useful while he made his boxes for 15 years. First, he made each box over a slow period of time, later he made them in series, telling a unique story in chronological order, and making sure that the composition of each one matches the other. He stayed true to his childhood theme, using many objects and images from the fun parks or children books. His series Medici Slot Machine was done with hidden awards, colored balls, and childlike play games. In Hotels and Observatories he emphasized the feeling of transcendence one encounters on a way to an observatory. His imagination was infinite. There was nothing he could not think of, and everything seemed possible and made sense. Passengers could travel outside of the world, visit the celestial landscapes, parrots could be targets for play shooting, and whole new worlds could fit into the box.

Carolyn Marks Blackwood,"Carolyn Marks Blackwood is a New York-based fine art photographer who has a knack for capturing the natural world and the beauty that lies therein. She is also a screenwriter, producer and principal partner at Magnolia Mae Films. Born in Anchorage, Alaska, Blackwood graduated from Livingston College, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.   Carolyn Marks Blackwood has been writing, making music and taking photos since she was a kid. Her father was interested in photography so Blackwood spent many happy hours in the dark room with him teaching about photography. She received her first camera when she was only seven years old. Most of Blackwood’s photographs are taken from her house in Rhinecliff, New York, which sits atop a 100-foot cliff overlooking the Hudson River. Some of her works are riverscapes, reminiscent of the Hudson River School, others, of clouds and water, are more abstract. During more than 30 years, she has produced numerous bodies of work that capture the natural environment and its abstractions.   Taking photographs for years, Blackwood never took herself seriously, while in 2006 the Morton Library in Rhinebeck asked her to put 10 pieces in a group show. It was there that Blackwood’s images of the Hudson River caught the attention of the esteemed critic and curator Barbara Rose, who asked if she could include some of Blackwood’s work in a show on modern luminism, The Magic Hour, that she was curating at a New York gallery. It was the moment when Blackwood realized that she was a photographer.   Carolyn Marks Blackwood’s photographs reframe segments of air, ice and water into vivid color fields, geometric abstractions and flattened motifs. By removing perspective and context, her unmodified images seize ephemeral moments within everyday occurrences and heighten them into foreign, unfamiliar pictures. Blackwood’s remarkable photographs of hundreds of starlings or red-winged blackbirds in flight freeze moments in nature of which people normally catch only a glimpse. In her photographs, the birds create patterns against the sky that are at once exquisite and menacing. Similar patterning marks her luridly colorful images of fish in overcrowded tanks at the Dutchess County Fair, and her overhead close-ups of the ice on the Hudson as it breaks up around the Rhinecliff dock. The beauty of her works is all about knowing where and how to look.   Carolyn Marks Blackwood had a career as a singer-songwriter and backup singer in the 1970s before developing TV programs in Paris starting in the late 1980s when television there became privatized. Artist lived with a noted Documentary director, Christian Blackwood for five years and married him two months before his death in July 1992. She founded Magnolia Mae Films with Gaby Tana in 1997. The first film produced by Magnolia Mae was The Duchess, which is set in England in the late 18th century and is about Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, who was forced to tolerate living with her husband’s mistress in the same house. Other films include The Invisible Woman, Philomena, and Coriolanus, directed by and starring Ralph Fiennes. Blackwood’s photographs are on the cover of many books and publications including New Yorker poet Deborah Digges’ posthumously-published book, The Wind Blows through the Doors of My Heart, as well as Swimming From Under My Father by Michael O'Keefe. A photograph by Blackwood appeared on the cover of the March 2009 issue of magazine Chronogram.  ",1365
Adam Pendleton,"Using a wide range of media from painting to photography, performance to video art, a Virginia-born conceptual artist Adam Pendleton draws his themes and iconography from the experience of the Conceptualism, Dadaism, Minimalism and experimental literature. He is referring to cultural movements from the 1960’s to today which includes mostly the ones from African-American political and social history such as Civil Rights Movement, Black Power and Black Arts Movement. He is best known for his paintings exploring politics and language through historical and modernist imagery.  As a young boy, Adam Pendleton used to spend hours in the basement of his family’s house in Richmond, Virginia, painting and studying art by artists such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. While attending the private Collegiate School in Richmond, Pendleton traveled alone and with his father to galleries and museums in New York. In 2000, he studied in an international art program in northern Italy. Two years later, when Pendelton was at the age of 18, he moved from Virginia to New York with the intention of becoming an artist. There, Adam would send slides of his works to New York galleries and follow up with phone calls. One dealer, who was also an assistant to artist Sol LeWitt, put Adam Pendleton in a group show. When LeWitt came to the gallery, he spotted Pendleton’s painting. Impressed by the work of young Pendleton, LeWitt bought the piece by trading one of his own pieces for it, becoming Pendleton’s first collector. In 2005, Adam Pendleton had his first solo show titled Deeper down There, at the Yvon Lambert Gallery. The show featured two-color canvases with silk-screened lines from modern African-American literature and music, as well as paintings resembling enlarged record album covers.   Adam Pendleton’s work often involves the investigation of language, in both the figurative and literal senses and the recontextualization of history through appropriated imagery. Much of Pendleton’s art is underpinned by an idea artist calls Black Dada, which fuses race with the early 20th-century avant-garde. The title of Adam Pendleton's series of paintings, Black Dada, 2008-2009, is borrowed from a 1964 work by the Beat poet and activist Amiri Baraka, Black Dada Nihilismus. Baraka's poem Black Dada Nihilismus became a point of departure for paintings that presented fragments of the text through conventions of Conceptual and Minimal art of the 1960s. The Black Dada paintings contain a partial view of Sol LeWitt’s cube sculptures, accompanied by one or more letters derived from the phrase ""Black Dada"".   Adam Pendleton’s large-scale performance, Revival, 2007, established his artistic style as modern and abstract. In the Revival, Pendleton presided over a 30-person choir and presented testimonials from poets such as Liam Gillick and Jena Osman. The piece was part of Performa Biennial 07 and was performed at Stephan Weiss studio. In Adam Pendleton’s performance works, but also through his printing projects and his installations such as System of Display, the artist reflects on social movements and questions of historical representation through procedural methods. System of Display is a series of works involving mirrors, letters and silkscreened images appropriated from art publications, among other sources. The images include photographs of the Fridericianum during the 1955 Documenta and of a couple dancing in the street during a celebration of independence in Congo, as well as stills of Anna Karina from Jean-Luc Godard’s film Made in U.S.A.  Adam Pendleton’s three-channel video installation entitled BAND, 2009, tracks the process of the indie rock, post-punk band Deerhoof working on and recording a new song, I Did Crimes for You. This approximately 12-minute video is loosely based on Godard’s film Sympathy for the Devil, which features The Rolling Stones recording their song of the same name. In BAND, footage of Deerhoof rehearsing is edited to include fragments from a 1971 documentary Teddy, about a young member of the Black Panther Party in Los Angeles. The resulting video follows the formal logic of Godard's film, but the scenario it presents is strikingly more ambiguous. The song’s lyrics consist of confrontational rhetoric characteristic of the late 1960s while the voiceover from the documentary speaks of the prospects of change and the efficacy of such violence.  In one of Adam Pendleton’s latest series titled Black Lives Matter, the artist is exploring the relations between race, politics and language, while keeping in mind the burden of the history on the present comprehensions of such relations. Pendleton is sending a clear message that, even in the United States, the idea of equal rights has only been recognized, but not yet accepted. He is referring to more recent events such as the political riots that burst out after the death of an eighteen-year-old African-American citizen in Ferguson, Missouri. Pendleton’s paintings from the series have a unique surface that lies between handmade and machine-made. The machine sprays the phrase on an abstract ground, creating a tension between overt and abstract modes of representation. Adam has also created a wall work that is an enlargement of a collage featuring the phrase Black Lives Matter.   Born in 1984, Pendleton is already a widely recognized artist. His installation Abolition of Alienated Labor, was featured in MoMA PS1’s Greater New York exhibition in 2010. Two years later, he signed with Pace Gallery at age 28, the youngest artist to do so since the 1970s. In 2015, at 31, he was the youngest artist to represent the Belgian Pavilion at 56th Venice Biennale. His work is included in the permanent collections of some of the most notable museums around the world including the Museum of Modern Art, NY, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. The artist's largest solo museum presentation Adam Pendleton: Becoming Imperceptible has been opened at the Contemporary Arts center in New Orleans in April 2016 and it will be on display through June 16, 2016.   Known for his engagement with language and re-contextualization of history through multi-disciplinary practices, Pendleton not only captures a moment in history but also uses his work to invite global conversations around social and racial controversies in the US. By creating work that often blends facts, ambiguous dates, found text, and appropriated images, he challenges and critiques the prevailing systems of racial prejudice. His art ultimately depicts the artist’s view of the world. The artist is represented by Pace Gallery, London; Pace Gallery, Beijing; Pace Gallery, Hong Kong; and Pace Gallery, Menlo Park.  ",1366
Kunstrasen,"Kunstrasen is a German stencil artist who derives his name from the German term for astroturf, or a surface of synthetic fibers made to look like natural grass (fake grass). In addition to a sly bit of wordplay (kunst = art), his chosen moniker is relevant to many pressing questions in the art world today, particularly those relating to issues of authenticity, mimicry, and mass production. The life of this German urban artist is kind of mystery, on purpose or not. One of the rare things we know about his identity is his real name – according to forums, it could be Phil. But, the lack of official info shouldn’t be an obstacle to getting into the Kunstrasen’s world of “an honest one layer stencil!”, as he likes to call it: Since there seems to be a trend towards the more layers the better I thought I'll do a one layer stencil to underline that I was never that good in being trendy...  Kunstrasen's artwork makes comments which question everyone’s relationship to art, especially within urban and pop art genres. His stencil work is clean and well executed and the artist has an instinctive ability to create strong visual puns and eye-catching images. When first confronted with the works of Kunstrasen, they may seem superficially indistinguishable from the works of any of the horde of Banksy wannabes – but to pass judgment in this way would be hasty. In a landscape dominated by Banksy clones attempting to cash in on the sudden popularity of a medium which can be rapidly and cheaply produced, what is the value of a form when it becomes divorced from the danger and transgression inherent in the origins of street art.  In 2013 he appeared in London Art Show 1, together with ABC, James Welton, Pure Evil, Bisser and many others. The goal of this show was, according to the organizers: “to boast lots of art with prices starting low and free giveaways”.  The idea was that the art is sold directly off the walls and then replaced with more the next day, so that public would wish to come back and pay another visit, to see some new pieces. Also, live painting by SR47 aka Skiprat and Kunstrasen attracted a whole bunch of visitors. The homogeneity of the market and the proliferation of mass produced, gallery-ready street art was the subject in Kunstrasen’s crosshairs as he prepared a collection of works to be exhibited at solo show for the first time.    In 2014, Kunstrasen held his first solo exhibition, Rough Times for Dreamers, at the artROOM Konstanz. Amidst the rapidly converging realms of stencil graffiti and contemporary visual art, Kunstrasen’s gritty and challenging show made some waves by challenging gallery audience’s eager consumption of mass-produced urban images. Rough Times for Dreamers was considered to be Kunstrasen’s chance to finally see his audiences in a different environment discussing his artworks. When street art is being pulled out of the streets and taken into the galleries, Kunstrasen offers a new reading of the problem. In a landscape dominated by Banksy clones attempting to cash in on the sudden popularity of a medium which can be rapidly and cheaply produced, what is the value of a form when it becomes divorced from the danger and transgression inherent in the For this show, Kunstrasen picked up on some older ideas/images as well as totally new ones. For example, on a piece titled This was Art, the thread was real... For the author, it was more interesting to do so and after some experimenting he realized it was better looking than painted on. But, on the show was mainly new body of work, based on the irony and re-interpretation of art. There were multiple specials around the show based on the brand new original works which are for view but sale, as well. Kunstrasen stayed in Konstanz for the entire week of the show, creating murals, finishing original work and heading the gallery installation.   In 2015, EBay Art auction was raising money for Nepal earthquake Disaster, by selling works of the artist willing to help. Kunstrasen donated his work Spot remover and 100% of the auction results went to DEC Nepal Earthquake Appeal.  All images copyright the artist",1367
Boicut,"Boicut is an Austrian artist whose illustrative work combines impulsive lines and shapes. In his work, he uses this pastel color palette as a reference of seeing the good things in life. Based on a concept, Boicut's main goal is to reach the perfect balance between the different shapes.  Boicut likes diversion. Besides working with markers and brushes he loves to create digital artwork on his computer. He is always wondering how his style works with different mediums. From the early beginning he started to paint on three dimensional objects as well.  One reason that drives the artist is to look for found objects and give them a new face by painting on them and therefore a new usage by turning it into an art object. Boicut focuses on everyday objects such as, for example, a washing machine, a water heater or a skate truck – things people buy but usually never really look at it to see the real beauty in it.  “The Shape of Things” is a title of Boicut's latest solo show that took place at Improper Walls gallery in 2015. With new body of work, Boicut examines visions of the young and young-minded.   Boicut has exhibited across the world and his work was shown in Berlin, London, Luxembourg, Miami, Munich and his home base Vienna. In addition, he has worked with brands such as Nitro Snowboards, Absolut, Jameson, Remington, Vans, Paul Frank, Levis, KangaRoos, Hennessy, Samsung, Converse. Since 2014 the artist is represented by Galerie Ernst Hilger / Hilger NEXT. Boicut lives and works in Vienna.",1368
Richard Artschwager,"An American painter, illustrator and sculptor, Richard Ernst Artschwager is associated with was Pop Art, Conceptual art and Minimalism, although he was known for stylistic independence. Born in 1923 in Washington D.C. to European immigrant parents, Artschwager received his love of art from his mother, who was an amateur artist and designer who studied at the Corcoran School of Art. In 1941, Artschwager entered Cornell University, where he studied chemistry and mathematics, returning to graduate in 1948 after being drafted to the World War II. Moving to New York with his wife, he began working as a baby photographer. In 1949, he studied with the painter Amédée Ozenfant in Paris for a year, abandoning art to work at various jobs to support his family, including designing and selling furniture. He returned again to art a few years later. His first solo exhibition was in 1965 at the age of forty-two at Leo Castelli Gallery. Throughout his practice, Artschwager sought to confound art-historical categories and challenge the relationship between perception and illusion. His early career as a furniture designer is evident in his later sculpture, which often mimicked the forms of furniture. He often drew his work from utilitarian objects and incorporated commercial and industrial materials. ",1369

Wassily Kandinsky,"A true legend of abstraction and art history, Wassily Kandinsky was an influential Russian painter and theorist whose concepts changed the very fundamental essence of art and the way it's perceived. Known for his lyrical style and innovative assumptions on nonfigurative art and its connections to music and soul, Kandinsky was the creator of the first modern abstract paintings. As you will soon come to see, the road was not an easy one and there were many problems to overcome along the way, but Kandinsky emerged as a respected leader of the abstract art movement in the early 20th century and a person without whom art history would not be quite the same.  Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky was born in Moscow, on the 16th of December, 1866 - just to be noted, this calculation is based on the Gregorian calendar, so do not be surprised if you somewhere stumble upon the information he was born on the December 4th. Wassily's parents were musicians Lidia Ticheeva and Vasily Silvestrovich Kandinsky, although his father mostly provided for the family by selling various exotic kinds of tea. During the earliest years, the situation in the household was a peaceful and idyllic one, but when the artist turned the age of five, that all changed as Lidia and Vasily decided to divorce each other. To somehow shelter their child from the messy chaos they've created, parents send young Wassily to Odessa to live with his aunt. Luckily, Kandinsky found living in Odessa quite beautiful - he learned how to play the piano and cello alongside his aunt, plus he studied drawing with a private teacher. It's interesting that even during these early years Wassily Kandinsky was already showing signs of his characteristic intimate relationship with art, the same approach that will make his worldwide famous later - his childhood's drawings reveal rather specific color combinations, infused by his perception that ""each color lives by its mysterious life"". Growing up in such an atmosphere installed into young Kandinsky dreams and hopes that one day he could become an artist, but his parents, although miles and miles away, had other ideas for their son's future. It broke his heart, but Wassily followed his family’s wishes and started studying law.  Wassily Kandinsky became a student of the Moscow's University in 1886. Although he never enjoyed what he was learning, that never stopped him from being one of the most promising students of the generation. Kandinsky graduated with flying colors and was given a fieldwork scholarship that had him sent to Vologda province. There the artist studied traditional criminal jurisprudence and modern confrontations between law and religion. By the time he arrived in Vologda, Kandinsky pretty much tucked away all his aspirations and dreams of becoming an artist, instead focusing on advancement in the law world. However, something happened in the province he was sent to - all the folk art and general spirituality of the Vologda people lighted a long-forgotten spark and he suddenly saw all of his artistic tendencies come back stronger than ever. It should be noted that although he was thinking about art constantly, Kandinsky never neglected the responsibilities of a law practitioner and was excellent at his profession although his heart was pulling him in other directions. Kandinsky married his cousin Anna Chimyakina in 1892 and took up a position on the Moscow Faculty of Law, all the while creating drawings and prints in his spare time.   Two events suddenly affected Kandinsky and subsequently led him to a change in career. The first was the exhibition of French Impressionists in Moscow the artist saw during the year of 1895 and the other was hearing Wagner's Lohengrin at the Bolshoi Theatre. The Wagner's composition proved to be the final spiritual bang that definitely set of Kandinsky's artistic career, but the influence provided by the Impressionist was without a doubt the most critical moment of the artist's life. After witnessing firsthand the genius work of Claude Monet's Haystacks, Kandinsky fell in love with the beauty of the nonrepresentational art. The artist chose to abandon his law career and move to Munich in order to fully commit himself to a full-time study of art. He was accepted into a prestigious private painting school and later prolonged his education at the Munich Academy of Arts - however, he continued to be mostly self-taught, stubbornly holding on to his childhood ideas of independent colors. Such inner confrontations did not stop him from being one of the top students here as well, just as he was the best law pupil although he never liked what he was learning.    Much of Kandinsky Wassily's art was based on theories, concepts and ideas, not practice. Before he came to Munich, he did not paint much and was mostly developing theories of how art should behave. The tables turned when he arrived in Germany, as the artist started painting much more than writing and thinking about art. Kandinsky began with conventional themes and art forms, exploring different techniques and styles. The teachers did not approve, but he continued to form theories derived from devoted spiritual study and informed by an intense relationship between music and color. These concepts will prove to be the foundation upon which Kandinsky built his career and establishing his ultimate status as the father of abstract art. In the world of Kandinsky, the color was not used to depict what was observed around us, it was not a simple tool for imitating and re-telling things everybody already knows. It was far from it. The artist saw color as much more than that, for him it was an expression of emotion rather than a faithful description of nature or subject matter. Soon after graduating - yet again with flying colors and honors - Kandinsky set out in the world and started forming friendships with similar-minded individuals who shared his concepts and who wanted to bring radical changes to the art scene. He frequently exhibited, taught art classes and published his ideas on theories of art, quickly becoming a huge name that shook the very basis of academic teachings and traditional techniques. Kandinsky divorced his wife in 1911 and moved in with the new girlfriend Gabriele Münter - the couple traveled extensively, settling in Bavaria before the outbreak of World War I.    By the time he became a walking legend of modern art, Kandinsky had already formed the New Artists Association in Munich. But another group will prove to be far more important than The Association - during the year of 1911, The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) group came to be. The organization was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Paul Klee, Alexej von Jawlensky and Marianne von Werefkin, but also featured native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele Münter. Der Blaue Reiter was an art movement that lasted up until the outbreak of the war in 1914 and was fundamental to Expressionism, simultaneously proving to be the key for abstraction painting. World War I took Kandinsky back to Russia, where his artistic eye was influenced by the constructivist movement, which subsequently saw him turning to hard lines, dots and geometry instead of expressive colors. Making full circles around Europe and returning to Russia was a traumatic experience for Kandinsky, but the real traumas happened when he and his new wife Nina Andreevskaya lost their only son when he was just over three years of age. After that, the artist was never quite the same as before, which is pretty understandable due to the circumstances of war and losing a son. Kandinsky stayed in Russia after the Revolution and applied his restless and comprehensive energies to the administration of educational and government-run art programs, helping to create Moscow’s Institute of Artistic Culture and Museum of Pictorial Culture.   Kandinsky returned to Germany a few times after the Revolution of his country was brought to an end. Most notably, he taught at the Bauhaus school in Berlin where he was revered as a true legend of modern art. During these mature years, traumatized Kandinsky wrote poems and plays much more than he was painting, but by his own claim, we now know that teaching at the Bauhaus school provided him with the most joy at the time he was not able to find much of it. Unfortunately, during the year of 1933, when the Nazis seized power and complete control over Germany, storm troopers notoriously shut down the Bauhaus school. Subsequently, Wassily Kandinsky was forced to flee and leave Berlin in order to survive. He and Nina had moved to the suburb of Paris in the late 1930s, when Marcel Duchamp had found a little apartment for them to try and outlast the war. In July 1937, he and other artists were featured in the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich. It was widely attended and raised one of the last bright german moments prior to the war, but 57 of his abstract works were confiscated by the Nazis and many were lost in the process. It is said that the Second World War was too much for the artist to bear emotionally and he never lived to see the end of the horror that was WWII. Kandinsky died of cerebrovascular disease in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, on December 13, 1944.    Kandinsky believed that each time period in art puts its own permanent stamp on the expression of the current generations that create at the time - his vivid interpretations of color through musical and spiritual sensibilities certainly altered the artistic landscape at the start of the 20th century. It is hard to think of a few more names in art history that have indebted us in a way Wassily Kandinsky managed to do. When talking about a grand man as is the case here, it's always hard to end the text in a way that will show enough respect for the subject at hand. For Kandinsky, perhaps the most appropriate way to bring the conclusion is to allow the man himself to have the final word: ""The artist must train not only his eye but also his soul"". ",1372
John Gerrard,"John Gerrard is an Irish artist, working in Dublin and Vienna, best known for his sculptures which typically take the form of digital simulations displayed using real-time computer graphics. Some of his more notable works include Lufkin (2009), Cuban School (2010) and Exercise (2012). Using the very software that enables the operations of entertainment, industry and warfare, the artist creates portraits of our world through the prism of its own technological medium. Overlaying terrain, figure, image and gesture captured from real bodies and sites using satellite data, intensive photographic documentation, 3D scanning and motion capture, Gerrard creates sculptures that exist in virtual space and unfold in real-time over the course of an entire year. By analyzing structures of energy in particular and reflecting on the rapid expansion of human endeavors during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, Gerrard creates work that haunts, mesmerizes and leaves the viewer thinking about the world we live in. An important body of radical and experimental work, these pieces are not photographs or videos, they are the new medium of realtime 3D objects, a kind of ""sculptural photography"" or ""new cinema"". His works are now in the permanent collections of the Tate, the museums of modern art in both San Francisco and New York, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). ",1373
Giorgio de Chirico,"Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico was a surrealist painter and a founder of the Metaphysical art movement, a term coined by writer Guillaume Apollinaire. Through his Neoclassical artworks, the artist questioned reality through metaphysical themes. He greatly influenced the surrealist movement, with a number of artists praising him for his unique style that helped shape their own, including Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, René Magritte, Carlo Carrà, and Carel Willink. Giorgio de Chirico (1888) was born in Volos, Greece, and he studied painting at Athens Polytechnic, where he was mentored by Georgios Jakobides and Georgios Roilos. Later, the artist entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where he got introduced to the writing of Arthur Schopenhauer, Otto Weininger, and Friedrich Nietzsche that greatly influenced his artistic expression. Chirico held his first solo exhibition at the Salon des Independants in 1913. Soon after, he signed a contract with the art dealer Paul Guillame. De Chirico’s early style was inspired by the metaphysical quality of Mediterranean cities, such as Turin and Florence. Highly influenced by Nietzsche’s writing, he often produced haunting works that evoke feelings of loneliness. The love of motionless city plazas can be best felt in his works The Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon and The Enigma of the Oracle while in Florence. Chirico said: The artist best captured what critics described as the feeling of ""power and freedom” through his use of powerful motives of towers, mannequins, and elongated shadows. Through images of loneliness and emptiness, the sense of freedom was felt strongly in all his paintings. However, later in life, he turned to more traditional ways abandoning the Metaphysical. He spoke strongly against modern art, which was in fashion at the time, instead of adopting the style of the old painters such as Signorelli and Raphael. He announced the switch in styles through an article titled The Return of Craftsmanship, published in 1919. Once more he changed his artistic expression in 1939, inspired by the works of Peter Paul Rubens. Unfortunately, to the artist's great distress, all the artworks from this later period did not receive the same praise as his earlier ones. Giorgio de Chirico inspired artists across all disciplines, including filmmakers Michelangelo Antonioni and Valerio Zurlini, poet Sylvia Plath and artist Philip Guston, Giorgio Morandi, and Paul Delvaux. Yves Tanguy wrote that he was inspired to become a painter after seeing one of de Chirico’s artworks. De Chirico was elected to the French Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1974. He continued producing stunning works of art well into his 90th year. Giorgio de Chirico died in 1978 in Rome. ",1374
Patrick Hughes,"Patrick Hughes is a British contemporary artist born in 1939, best known for his original concept of Reverspective paintings and wall reliefs.  Hughes is an inventor of a “reverspective” optical illusion that challenges the nature of perception and perspective by creating an illusion on a 3-dimensional surface where the parts of the picture which seem farthest away are actually physically the nearest. The artist begins by constructing pyramid- or wedge-shaped blocks out of wood, which he combines into ridged panoramas. He then paints scenes into the blocks, depicting different interior spaces.",1375

Angel Otero,"By combining elements from personal history, the legacy of abstraction, and Spanish Baroque's painterly traditions, Puerto Rican artist Angel Otero creates bewildering painterly works that are the result of his expressive process-based approach. The draped oil skins reflect Otero’s treatment of material that is simultaneously harsh and gentle, at the same time reminiscent of the rebelliousness of street art and Art brut, but also Rauschenberg’s combines. While his early works were inspired by personal memorabilia and the gestures of prolific masters such as Nicolas Poussin, Pablo Picasso, and Willem de Kooning, his more recent works are more focused on artistic material and its physicality. Otero earned his MFA in 2009 and his BFA in 2007 from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, he received the Leonore Annenberg Fellowship in the Visual Arts and is employed at the New York City Department of Education.

He was a prominent member of the Berlin Dada and New Objectivity group during the Weimar Republic before immigrating to the United States in 1933. After leaving Germany prior to Hitler's assumption of power, Grosz turned to romanticized nudes, New York cityscapes, and watercolor landscapes in a departure from his earlier social engagement.",1380
Crystal Wagner,"The expansion of forms through space is what triggers Crystal Wagner the most and marks her artistic practice being perceived in as an installation art. The constant struggle of two and three-dimensional forms in this particular case is an advantage; a ground zero from which the whole concept develops. By using different techniques such as printmaking, Wagner constructs massive site specifics which seem to be reflecting the artist's interest in the living world we are often not capable of perceiving. As a matter of fact, the spaces are being transformed into mysterious living entities which are devouring different elements of architecture and street infrastructure.   Crystal Wagner  was born in 1982 in Baltimore, Maryland. She attended Keystone College, a private liberal arts school in Pennsylvania where she earned her Associate Degree in Fine Art. Afterward, Wagner received her BFA from the Atlanta College of Art in 2004 and an MFA from the University of Tennessee in 2008. Interestingly, her thesis exhibition led to the purchasing of one of her large sculptural forms by the Knoxville Museum of Art. Crystal Wagner taught as an art professor at Georgia College of Liberal Arts for five years, but then she decided to focus exclusively on her artistic career and quit her job since her artistic work was becoming increasingly popular.   Wagner’s interest in art began from early impressions on the natural world. As a child she started drawing imaginative birds, while years later during her studies, she spent four months in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, experiencing the diverse terrain of the elevated landscape, studying and drawing from nature in the backcountry. Therefore, her amorphous installations  are filled with a vibrant array of colorfully unique shapes, details, and textures. They are all manually processed, designed and prepared specifically for a particular place which is practically being taken over by the work. Besides the installations, the artist has been producing peculiar shadow boxes respectively paper sculptures.     Her most recent commissions include a large-scale installation for the internationally recognized band The Flaming Lips. a large shadow box for GNU a snowboard company out of Portland, a large-scale installation piece for NIKE, presented in the Shrine Auditorium for The KOBE X Blackout Experience, and most recently two installations for Viacom, one of which is called Wild Efflux and located at their headquarters in Times Square. It is the 117-foot-long piece, accompanied by what the artist calls terrariums – small, framed paper sculptures that resemble portable worlds.    In 2016 the Polish UNIQA Art Łódź organization commissioned the installation from Wagner. The concept she delivered was embodied as a wild exterior growth that wraps around the art nouveau façade of a 100 years old building in Lodz. The apparent fascination with the site led the artist on creating the dialog between architecture and organic forms and structures found in nature. Namely, this is an extension of her exploration aimed to question juxtaposition and context of our relationship with cultivated spaces/structures and the natural world. The work is made of thin metal, wire and UV and waterproof Ripstop material, which is used on professional kites.    In the last few years, the artist had several solos and participated in various group exhibitions. Wagner’s rising career was additionally flavored with received grants among which the important ones are the Pollock-Krasner Grant from 2015, as well as Awesome Foundation Art Grant in the category Awesome Without Borders. The artist was honored with the Sculpture and Installation Award of the SEE.ME, Art Takes Paris, international art competition. Without the doubt, the outstanding approach to installation well-thought concepts and minutely executions are characteristics which make the art practice of Crystal Wagner quiet authentic and on the height of the task.

Crail Moansburg,"Crail Moansburg is a Dutch artist known for his colorful and expressive screenprints made in his studio in the Karl Marx Factory in The Hague. Born to a German mother and American father, the artist attended the Royal Art Academy in Arnhem, a city located in the eastern part of the Netherlands, when he was eighteen years old. His works were stunning, but that was not enough for the young artist, so he interrupted his career as an art student to become a manager in a club in the Spijkerkwartier district, the part of Arnhem that has been well known for its red lights in the past decades.   Inspired by a new job, Moansburg also took up his paintbrush again. Behind the scenes, the artist captured scenes of performances and performers in the nightclub. He used the posters announcing shows in the backgrounds of his work. After the club was dismantled by the local authorities, Moansburg had no choice but to focus himself on his original talent again. Originating from the thought that art should be, above all, layered, his visions on the aesthetics have been developed and made explicit. His paintings depict randomness of the fetishes the people has developed influenced by the culture of capitalism. Also, his art shows a high admiration for the past times.  Crail Moansburg has participated in several shows. In July 2015, his work was included in group show Dog Days in London’s Hang-Up gallery.  Anything but Kissing on the Lips was Moansburg’s show organized with his Mrs. Moansburg in a former brothel in the red light district in Amsterdam in October, 2014.    ",1384

Hajime Sorayama,"Predicting the future, Hajime Sorayama announces the world of seductive robotic women through his imaginative and highly accomplished paintings in the hyper-realistic style. Creating art that has always been ahead of their time, during the 1970’s his characters came from the 21st century, bringing the aura of the robotic, mythic and fantastical world of imagination. His range of achievements is equally spectacular, with unprecedented acclaim from the most prominent museum institutions, collectors, and clients. Using a specialized brush designed by the artist himself, pencil and acrylic paint, this Japanese artist is widely respected for his perfect technique, proving himself as a master of his domain.  Sorayama was born in 1947 in Imabari, Ehime prefecture in Japan where he had finished Imabari Kita High School. Early interested in drawing, he started to create images inspired by Playboy pin-ups. After he read a book by Makoto Oda I’ll go and see everything (Nandemo Mite yaro) in which the writer describes his travels through Europe and Asia, Sorayama decided to study English literature and Greek language at Shikoku Gakuin University. Founding the school paper named Pink Journal, its content was criticized by both teachers and other students, so he moved to the Chubi Central Art School in Tokyo to study art. After his graduation at the age of only 21, he started to work for an advertising agency and, gaining enough experience, he decided to try as a freelance illustrator in 1972. His first robot appeared in 1978 when his friend, designer Hara Koichi asked him to draw something based on C-3PO from Star Wars. Managing to coordinate his work in fine art, illustration, and industrial design, Sorayama separated this three kinds of expression, considering illustration as something not connected with emotion, but with experience that comes from logical thinking. ""Art is a kind of tenacity, an insistence upon asserting your own originality. By contrast, superrealism deals with the technical issue of how close one can get to one's object.[1]""   In 1983, he published his first book Sexy Robot which enabled his organic robotic forms to become famous and recognizable worldwide. Starting with the ideas from pin-up art, he represented his so-called gynoids, half-metal, half-human creatures. The first book was followed by the second one, Pin-up, in the same manner. His oeuvre now includes numerous books published throughout his career. Creating highly realistic depictions in latex and leather, their popularity grew, so he started to make illustrations for the pages of Penthouse magazine and Playboy TV, television special dedicated to his art. Besides paper pieces, in 1985 he released the Illustration Video, which announced his later engagement for the films Brain Dead (1992), Timecop (1994), and Space Trucker (1995). Sorayama designed also the trading cards, limited edition prints, covers for Aerosmith’s 2001 album and produced an initial idea for what would later become Sony’s dog-like robotic pet, the AIBO which went to market in 1999. Respected as a founder of airbrush technique, Sorayama’s hyper-realistic artful depictions of sensual metallic qualities of robots are firmly established his reputation. Sorayama said:   Sorayama was a recipient of the Grand Prize of Best Design award for his first-generation AIBO design in 2000 and his little robotic dog was included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Smithsonian Institution. His very remarkable cooperation with Hollywood filmmakers on various science and fiction projects resulted in an engagement by Star Wars creator George Lucas to design a spread of Twi’ek and droid fantasy Star Wars pin-ups for a tribute book named Star Wars Art Concept. His first solo exhibition in front of the American audience has been held at the Tamara Bane Gallery, California in 1994. Existing in the global scene which still explores its possibilities, challenging the relation between art and design, Hajime Sorayama is definitely the artist who could provide answers.    ",1386

Carlos Cruz-Diez,"French-Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez (1923-2019) was the most renowned color theorist of the 20th century. His paintings and kinetic installations put color into motion evoking full bodily sensations in the viewers. The artist was one of the most prominent figures of the Optical and Kinetic Art movement that saw color as the separate reality in time and space, yet constantly present. Today, Cruz-Diez’s works are part of several permanent collections, including Centre Pompidou in Paris, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and Tate Modern in London.   Carlos Cruz-Diez was born in Caracas, Venezuela and studied Visual Applied Arts at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. At the same time, he worked for several major magazines in Venezuela, such as El Farol and La Esfera, as a designer and illustrator. However, his major artistic breakthrough happened after the move to Spain. There he created abstract compositions Objetos Rítmicos Móviles and Parénquimas. After a brief visit to Paris, he returned to Venezuela and opened Estudio de Artes Visuales, where he explored the optical and kinetic forms in art. Over time the investigation evolved into a movement thanks to  Alejandro Otero and Jesús Rafael Soto. In the 1960s, he permanently relocated to Paris with his family. Cruz-Diez created the illusion of movement by utilizing lines of contrasting colors, the so-called Moiré effect that can best be seen in his series titled Physiochrome. For a time he worked as a teacher at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The French government awarded him the medal of Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2002.   During the mid-fifties, Cruz-Diez finished eight investigations about the conduct of color in paintings, such as Chromatic Induction, Color in Space, Chromosaturation, and Additive Color. The artist created exquisite works where the viewer was an active participant. Thus, he succeeded in shifting the established perception that color is a fixed property of matter. During the 60s, he debated his ideas with prominent artists such as Morellet, Agam, Lygia Clark, Tinguely, and Camargo. About his artwork Cruz-Diez said: They serve as support for an event that evolves in real time and space, and change with the shifting of light and the distance of the observer. They are autonomous situations, devoid from anecdotes, in which the viewer witnesses color being raveled and unraveled, with no past or future, in an everlasting present.   He participated in the renowned group show Perceptive eye at the MoMA in 1965, which was unfortunately not well received by the critics. In the ’70s, the artist began implementing his ideas and work in urban spaces. In 1970 he participated in Venice Biennale representing Venezuela and was the recipient of the Prize for Painting at the São Paulo Biennale. Besides installations, he created numerous architectural models, paintings, silk-screen prints, and videos. In his honor, Caracas opened Carlos Cruz-Diez Print and Design Museum in 1997. In 2014 the Cruz-Diez Foundation created by his family published his memoirs titled Living in Art: Memories of What I Remember.  ",1390
Henri Michaux,"Henri Michaux was a Belgian-born painter best known for his painting, poetry and prose. He experimented with psychedelic drugs, especially LSD and mescaline, which resulted in some of his most intriguing works. His visual art is often comprised of squiggly, organic abstractions, hinting at the artist’s altered state and the broadening of his senses. Born in 1899 in Namur, Belgium, Michaux abandoned his college education to travel extensively through Asia and South America, discovering philosophical and cultural ideas that resonated with him throughout the rest of his career. The philosophy of Buddhism and calligraphy influences many of his poems and inspired many of his drawings. He later took French citizenship. His art was the subject of shows at both the Museum of Modern Art in Paris and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York in 1978. Today, his works are part of several collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Tate Gallery in London, among others. Michaux worked in a Surrealist style with figurative elements that verged on abstraction. His visual art was very much influenced by the paintings of Paul Klee, Max Ernst, and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as by his experiences taking hallucinogenic drugs. He focused on the impossibility of making sense of modern society, while also exploring the vastness of self-reflection and psychoactive experiences. His experimentations with drugs, especially LSD and mescaline, resulted in two of his most intriguing literary works, Miserable Miracle and The Major Ordeals of the Mind and the Countless Minor Ones.",1391
Josef Hoflehner,"Josef Hoflehner is an Austrian artist known for his stunning, mostly black-and-white, landscape photographs taken in some of the most remote and forbidding areas of the world; including Antarctica, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Zanzibar, China, Japan, Malaysia, Yemen, and Iceland, to name a few.  Born in 1955 in Wels, a city in Upper Austria, Hoflehner purchased his first camera when he was twenty years old. For the past four decades he has been traveling the world creating his inimitable photographs. His work revolves around capturing cities or entire countries in such a way as to bring out some unspoken quality of the place not picked up by the naked eye in real-time.  The artist especially loves to photograph wide-open spaces where one can see the horizon unimpaired, such as coastlines or deserts. One of his most famous series of work titled Jet Airliner depicts mostly high-key photographs of low-flying passenger planes over a public beach on the island of St. Maarten in the Caribbean Sea. The beach is located near international airport, so the passengers jet roar as low as four meters above the heads of sunbathers. Created between 2009 and 2011, the series is often described as one of the most original photographic series ever created.  Hoflehner published more than ten books of his work and received several awards including Nature Photographer of the Year 2007.  He has participated in numerous exhibitions and art fairs at galleries throughout the world including Galerie Nikolaus Ruzicska, Salzburg, Austria; Local Galeria, Mexico City, Mexico; Joseph Bellows Gallery, San Diego, California, USA; Young Gallery, Brussels, Belgium; Open Shutter Gallery, Durango, Colorado, USA; Michael Hoppen Gallery, London, UK; Galeria Valid Foto, Barcelona, Spain; Galerie Monika Mohr, Hamburg, Germany; Bonni Benrubi Gallery, New York City, USA; AD-Galerie, Genolier, Switzerland, among others.

Ibram Lassaw,"A Russian-American sculptor, Ibram Lassaw is best known for non-objective construction in brazed metals. One of America's first abstract sculptors, he pioneered an innovative welding technique that allowed him to create dynamic, intricate, and expressive works in three dimensions. Born in 1913 in Alexandria, Egypt, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to Russian-Jewish parents, Lassaw arrived in New York at the age of eight and became a citizen in 1928. There, he attended The Clay Club founded by Dorothea Denslow at the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, where he learned classical sculpture techniques such as clay modeling and plaster casting. The International Exhibition of Modern Art, organized by Katherine Drier and the Société Anonyme, at The Brooklyn Museum, served as a formative experience for him, describing him as ""Future Shock"". Lassaw was a key force in shaping New York School sculpture. Believing that the future of sculpture was in open space and the use of materials for its “self- color”, he created work that he described as ""action sculpture"", since it grew without a plan, moment by moment. Inspired by internal structures found in nature, cosmology, astronomy, and technological construction, Lassaw created sculptures with complex interiors that aimed to entice viewers to lose themselves within them.

Jean Dufy,"The story of Jean Dufy begins in Paris, a town that's without the slightest doubt the world's modern art capital. There are literally just a few styles of the late 19th and early 20th century that can not be somehow connected to the biggest city in France - even those which had their beginnings away from Paris always hoped to one day be displayed on the streets where modern art was shaped. In a time when impressionism was writing the pages of art history, somewhere in a small fishing place in France was born a boy that soon dreamed of the day he could walk down the main avenue of Paris and see his paintings hanging from the windows of the famous Salons. This boy's name was Jean Dufy.  Jean Dufy was born in Le Havre (a seaport in the northwest of France) on March 12, 1888. His family was a large one, so he ended up being the last of total nine children. Although the Dufys were considered a part of the working class, all family members had a great affinity for art - especially music. Jean liked music, but ever since his older brother Raoul Dufy got into painting, Jean knew that was the road for him as well. At that point, Raoul became his brother's mentor, so to speak, while also being an educator because the Dufys couldn't afford to have any of their children enrolled in costly artistic schools. Instead, Jean received formal education at the École Primaire Supérieure du Havre. He graduated at the age of sixteen and immediately landed a job as a traveling clerk in a French import company, but soon Jean was promoted to a position of secretary on a transatlantic ship La Savole which traveled regularly between his hometown and New York. His business took precedence over Jean's hopes of becoming a famous painter. After many years of traveling and seeing different places, in 1906 Jean accidently stumbled upon an exhibition in Le Havre's Cercle de l’Art Moderne  and at that moment decided to pursue the long forgotten dream of painting. He received private tutoring wherever he was able to find it and in the year of 1914, Jean's first watercolor paintings were exhibited at the Galerie Berthe Weill. These early works of his career were lacking in color when compared to the later, classic Dufy. What seemed a beginning of a great career was unfortunately almost instantly put to a halt in only a few weeks when the biggest world conflict so far erupted between the forces of Europe. Jean was drafted and placed in a horse regiment.  After courageously serving in the military for full two years, Jean decided to fulfill his intentions of participating in the Parisian art scene. Sadly, his goals were again put on hold because war-torn France had no immediate need of art. While the country's rebuilding was in full motion, Jean worked with his brother in a textile factory in Lyon. Soon he was offered a job of decorating porcelain in Limoges - Jean spent many years of his life there and was presumably very happy with that employment. He was also very successful at this job and was awarded the Gold Medal at L’exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs. In 1920 he finally settled in Paris, in the famous artists quarter of Montmartre, next door to Georges Braque. Braque turned Jean towards experimenting with cubism, noting that the young painter's work could be massively enhanced with the new style. Jean liked the idea and decided to give some elements of cubism a chance. He also fell in love with the pre-war Fauve movement which deeply influenced him. In Paris, Jean also spent some considerable time with the likes of Picasso, Apollinaire, Rouault and Derain.    In 1923 came Dufy's first big exhibition. In the Salon d’Automne he displayed his artwork - only unlike the exhibition in 1916, this time, Jean had a chance to learn from the greats of Picasso and Braque before painting his pieces and placed them in the gallery. Jean was well received by the Parisian society and was asked to display his paintings again in the years of 1924, 1927, and 1932. His work presented scenes from both the city and the country - he depicted circuses, horse races, stages, Parisian streets, orchestras. He loved painting the Eiffel Tower, bridges of the Seine and the historical gates of Paris - Jean Dufy fell in love with the city he pursued all his life. This was the time he tackled the toughest opponent of his creative life, light. It became the essential focus of his work and in searching for this light he was able to master his fear of the blank canvas. We can note a large amount of blue present in his work. This is certainly a personal affection, but is's also a clear nod towards the impressionism he loved as a child. Eventually, Jean Dufy became a name that rang out within and beyond the borders of Paris. There is a theory out there that claims Dufy's work was extremely influenced by the early jazz movement that came to Paris along the WWI American soldiers. This makes sense when you consider Jean's musical upbringing and the sheer dynamic of colors in his paintings. In 1937, the life of Jean Dufy took a turn for the worse. He got into a fight with Raoul over authorizing a certain mural and after the French public seemingly took his brother's side, Jean, insulted, moved to the country to live a quieter life. He lived the next thirty years joyously, traveling around the world with his wife - and of course, painting until the last day of his life.        It's not easy to determine the exact influence Jean Dufy had on the artistic world. While he did not succeed in becoming the founder of a new style - which never was his goal - Jean did combine the aspects of impressionism, cubism and fauvism in a coherent accumulation. That by itself is an astonishing triumph. Today, his work can be found in countless collections of the most prestigious museums of the world - and the often seven digits prices at his auctions are enough of an indicator of his popularity. Dufy was a true example of a 20th-century bohemian artist whose life was centered on painting, but he was also a man who never cowered from his obligations to France and stood tall against the forces of Germany and Austria. As a man Jean was impeccable, but as an artist - well, we can safely call him immortal.  The artist is represented by Puccio Fine Art in New York, USA.

Sarah Hardacre,"Sarah Hardacre makes collages and prints featuring city landscapes and women cut out from vintage magazines. She gives a new role to women when she puts them into 20th-century modernism architecture. Not so typically feminist, her art is more than just a shout out for women's rights or a gentrifications issue. Sarah tries to imagine what would the world look like today if women had more power during the 50's, and how would the city look like if women were given an opportunity to voice out their opinion. There is a special thing about her collages that can not be overlooked, it is how to curvaceous body of a woman looks like in comparison to robust, edgy and rough buildings and skyscrapers.   Hardacre raises the question of proportion, and she wonders how we choose to surround ourselves with cubes and rectangles, where the symbol of life - woman's body, is round, soft and voluptuous. The reason she chooses vintage publications and retro issues of men entertainment magazines lies in the fact photographs were not so much retouched as they are now. There was no contouring of the face and body, no fake tanning and no Photoshop like there is now. Of course, the artist is aware beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, but beauty standards don't and they are almost always dictated by the ones who set the rules of commerce and advertising. It is the same for architecture.    Sarah works in her hometown, Salford and in Machester and she uses urban landscape photos, from the government build houses that someone, on the hierarchically highest position, gave command to build, and tries to emphasize the opposing natures of the woman presented in her collage and the woman who actually lived one of the houses. Sexual revolution and women's rights are the background for her work, but the context is very subtle because the artist has no intention to be very blatant about it. Huge blocks of buildings were united into communities and there was a group leadership that governed, but the promise for the better future was not given to the second group that governed and sustained the households - women were in the kitchen and in magazines. Sarah put them up front.    As the times have changed, so have the rights of women, and Hardacre stresses out the women's changing role in society. The artist had many exhibitions worldwide, and her work can be seen in the collections of The British Museum and the British Council. She started Art Yarn with artist Rachel Elwell, where they used the hype of yarn bombing to help people learn new skills and develop new creative hobbies. In her modern-retro collages, there sits gorgeous woman seductively smiling next to the automating block of concrete. She is taking control and stepping out of the house into the world where she can have and impact and participate. The artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art gallery.

O'Clock,"Often considered one of the most productive and the most creative artists in the history of Parisian graffiti scene, O’Clock has left his mark on subway systems all over the City of Light as well as beyond. A true innovator, the French artist is known for pushing the boundaries of his style to new heights. As a man of extreme confidence in his art, he was always seeking to take risks and find new, uncharted places to explore, so today his art can be found on the numerous streets, subways, trains, trucks, tunnels, rooftops, highways, but also in many galleries.    O’Clock was born in 1976 in a French department Val-de-Marne. He discovered graffiti scene in the second half of the 1980s, in the suburbs of the Parisian metropolitan. The first O’Clock tag appeared on the streets of France’s capital in 1995. Through the years, this mysterious creative has developed the style that he describes as “classic and efficient but I prefer not to repeat the same tag or the same pieces forever, I need to renew my delight surprise, change, renew, confrontation with the unknown and danger, my alibi is graffiti.”  While he was active on the streets, O’Clock was a member of different groups including international collective 156 All Starz, also known as 156 crew, founded by the artist JonOne in 1984, LT27 that was active in Paris between 1997 and 2002, as well as 73 (EF), YKS and P2B in recent years. In the beginning of 2000s, he had problems with the law in his native country and in the United States. He was arrested in New York City after police saw him videotaping graffiti as he traveled downtown on the Number 5 train. Additionally, he stopped his illegal activities to concentrate on other artistic projects.   In the past several years, the French artist has created an immersive body of work inspired by graffiti. In one of his latest solo exhibition - entitled Ubiquités, that was on display at David Bloch Gallery, Marrakesh, in April 2016 - O’Clock presented a series of installations involving photography, video, and several explicit objects gathering, painting, sculpture. His exquisite mixed-media pieces highlight the reasons, desires, and motivations that have pushed him to create art. The artist is represented by David Bloch Gallery.  ",1400
Burton Morris,"Burton Morris makes colorful and bold pop art using everyday objects as a central theme. His vivid colors emphasize the simplicity and graphic pop character of his artwork. Using imagery from pop culture, brands, and logos, he makes vibrant art that gives a new dimension to random, ordinary items, such as certain food types, coffee cups, ketchup bottles, cars, and tools. Some of his works was a permanent part of a famous cafe, Central Perk, from the TV show Friends. He exhibited artwork worldwide, from the Europe to the USA.  Burton Morris was born in 1964, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After an accident, he had when he was just 3 years old, he was on bedrest and he fell in love with drawing, since it was all he could do. He studied graphic design and illustration at the Carnegie Mellon University and graduated in 1986. His first career-making job was at an advertising agency, where he worked as the art director. He founded Burton Morris Studios in 1990. Just two years later his artwork appeared in the TV show Friends, and he had a major collaboration with Absolut Vodka. His childhood love for comic books, and love for Pop Art, especially Andy Warhol, gave him the idea to start combining illustration and graphic design. Morris started working with basic elements of pop art, such as food packaging, grocery store objects, and icons of popular culture. He used them to express his optimistic and bright energy and colorful style.   Morris had a major success with his 76th Annual Academy Awards poster. Inspired by his childhood hero Dick Tracy, he made a contemporary illustration of a man in a suit, holding a camera, ready to take a picture. The viewer is encouraged to imagine all the Hollywood A-listers standing on the red carpet, striking a pose. Hollywood is all about tradition and classics, and Burton Morris managed to bring a breath of fresh air into their image. The next big thing for Morris was the invitation to design work for the Summer Olympic Games in 2004. The assignment was to capture the contemporary spirit of the Olympics, and he successfully did so by making Olympic torches appear in a repetitive manner, just in different color. Ingeniously captivating, these images were modern, fresh, with a certain buzz, yet still iconic, and perfectly suitable for the occasion. His fondness of icons comes from the advertising background, where he learned to communicate in the pictorial language. Burton uses the common method, a picture is worth a thousand words, and creates a unique experience for the viewer, leaving them feeling positive and optimistic.   His goal was to create simple icons, make them as a brand, and showcase them. So, when he was asked to commemorate a Coca-Cola bottle in 2015, celebrating the 100 years of the famous brand, he continued where he predecessors left and gave an image to the iconic product. His mantra is that an icon, a pop art icon, has to be recognizable, likable and appealing. He made 100 Coca-Cola bottle paintings, as a partial homage to Warhol, who made 100 Campbell soup paintings. Coca-Cola represents group gatherings, family dinner, summer refreshment, a typical classic American thing. Burton tried to experiment with his artwork and used spray paint, acrylics, and screen printing. The colors stayed classic though silver, red, black and white. He presented this work at the Soho Contemporary Art Exhibition in New York, where, before him, Keith Haring, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jean-Michel Basquiat were exhibiting their work. Burton Morris makes real pop art icon, and he himself is an icon, too. The artist is represented by Kunzt Gallery.  ",1401

Andre Masson,"French artist André Masson is best known for his surrealist paintings and drawings. Throughout his career, he experimented with automatic writing and incorporated its principles into his painting process. In his work, he often depicted raw images of valence, eroticism, and physical metamorphosis. The artist sought to create directly from his subconsciousness, thus creating spontaneous compositions. In the mid-1920s, he became a member of the renowned Surrealist group of artists, led by notable André Breton. Today his work is part of several public collections, including the Tate Museum in London, The Guggenheim Museums, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art.   André Masson was born in 1896 in Balagny-sur-Thérain, France. At just 11 years old, he enrolled in the École des arts décoratifs in Brussels, where he studied under the mentorship of renowned painter Constant Montald. Later he moved to Paris where he studied at the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts. There he was introduced to the ideas of Cubism and Futurism through the works of James Ensor. Later he became fascinated with mythological themes in the works of Nicolas Poussin, which he subsequently incorporated into his art. Masson fought in World War I and was seriously wounded. It was an experience that stayed with him and profoundly affected his artistic expression. The artist painted In The Tower of Sleep (1938), which depicted the violence and horror of WWI and the Spanish Civil War.   In the 1920s, he was introduced to automatic writing by the members of the Surrealist group, and together with artist Joan Miró, he began exploring the creative force and potential of the unconscious. One of his most renowned pieces from this period is the work Battle of the Fishes (1927), created with glue and sprinkled sand, with gave the painting texture and complexity. By 1946 Masson completely severed all contact with the Surrealist group and its founder Breton because he felt their way was too dogmatic. Once WWII broke up, André Masson moved to the United States, where he influenced several young artists, including Jackson Pollock. While living in Connecticut, like in his childhood, he was surrounded by landscape, which resulted in a number of landscape paintings that incorporated American Indian motifs.   When in 1946, Masson returned to France, his work became more abstract, and it incorporated several influences, from Zen Buddhism and Impressionism to gestural calligraphy and French Tachisme. The artist regularly designed theater sets, such as for the ballet production Les présages (Destinies) by Léonide Massine. In 1958 the Venice Biennale showcased an entire room dedicated to his work. In 1965, he received a commission from the novelist and Minister of Cultural Affairs André Malraux to paint the ceiling of the Théâtre de l'Odéon in Paris. Throughout his career, he had several major solo exhibitions, including Akademie der Künste in Berlin (1964), Museum of Modern Art in New York (1976), Musée d'art moderne de la Ville de Paris (1976–77), and Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (1981). The artist passed away in 1987 in Paris. ",1405
Norman Rockwell,"Not just a skillful illustrator working within the conventions of the day, Norman Rockwell was an American artist whose skills were often questioned during his career. But there was something tenacious about his vision, and something uncanny about his access to the wellsprings of public taste. Although technically he was an academic painter, he had the eye of a photographer, and as he was maturing, he used this eye to give his viewers a picture of America that was familiar to everyone and unique at the same time. It seemed familiar to everyone because it was everyone’s dream of America, and it was unique because the artist managed to bring it to life with such authority. Perhaps, it was an America that never existed, but it was an America the public wanted to exist. And Rockwell put it together from elements that were there for everyone to see, but not all could experience.   Born on Manhattan’s upper West Side in New York to Jarvis Waring Rockwell and Anne Mary ""Nancy"" Rockwell, née Hill, Norman Rockwell grew up in suburban Mamaroneck as a gawky, nearsighted beanpole in the shadow of an athletic older brother, dodging bullies and ingratiating himself to schoolmates with his ability to draw.[1] It was a skill he practiced with his father, a textile company clerk who copied magazine illustrations as a hobby. As a high school student, he was quite indifferent, but he eagerly studied art. In 1908, he enrolled part-time at the Chase School of Art and then the Art Students League in Manhattan, financing his courses with his parents' support and odd jobs. By 1910, he had dropped out of high school to pursue art full time. The growth in mass magazine publishing made illustration a promising and lucrative field to youngsters such as Rockwell, who idolized the imagery of established 19th-century artists such as Howard Pyle, Winslow Homer, and John La Farge. After working jobs of minor importance, at age 18, Rockwell had his first paid commission, illustrating a series of stories for a 1912 question-and-answer book for children. In 1913, he landed a job as art editor at Boys' Life, a magazine for which he'd been freelancing. That and commissions for other youth-oriented publications finally gave him the courage in 1916 to approach The Saturday Evening Post, which immediately took him on. That cemented a 47-year relationship with the Saturday Evening Post that made Norman Rockwell one of the most famous, if not the most famous illustrator in America.   Yet, a year later, in 1917, Rockwell was voicing doubts about his career choice. He complained that he ""hated"" illustration because it ""cramped"" his vision, but he wasn't ""big enough"" to give it up and try something else – it was an ambivalence he would voice throughout his life. With traits of classical artistic personality, Rockwell was an anxious, lonely, self-doubting man. However, these were indeed troubling traits to bring into the roles of a father and husband. His first wife, Irene O’Connor, whom Rockwell married in 1916, was the model in Mother Tucking Children into Bed, published on the cover of The Literary Digest on January 19, 1921. She left the artist for another man in 1929, after 14 years of parties and high living in suburban New Rochelle, N.Y. Depressed, he moved briefly to Alhambra, California as a guest of his old friend Clyde Forsythe. There he met and married Mary Barstow, a California schoolteacher 14 years his junior. They had three sons, Jarvis Waring, Thomas Rhodes, and Peter Barstow, and in 1939 moved from New Rochelle to Arlington, Vt. In 1953, the Rockwells moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, so that Marry could be treated at the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital at 25 Main Street, close to where Rockwell set up his studio. The artist also received psychiatric treatment, seeing the renowned developmental psychologist and pioneer of psychobiography Erik Erikson, who was on staff at Riggs. It was Erikson who diagnosed that Rockwell only painted his happiness without really living it. In 1959, Mary died unexpectedly of a heart attack. Two years later, Rockwell married his third wife, retired Milton Academy English teacher, Mary Leete ""Mollie"" Punderson.    Technically speaking, Norman Rockwell was a painter, and yet, he was best known for his illustrations. The truth is that he was talented on many different levels. With the eye for photography, he made some meticulously composed and richly detailed, later built upon, turning up as illustrations or oil paintings. Working alongside skilled photographers, Rockwell acted as director, carefully orchestrating models, selecting props, and choosing locations for the photographs - works of art in their own right - that served as the basis of his iconic images. It’s interesting to point out that many of his most memorable characters: the girl at the mirror, the young couple on prom night, the family on vacation – were actually his friends and neighbors who served as amateur models.[2] A prolific artist, Rockwell produced more than four thousand original artworks. During his career, however, his work was often dismissed by serious art critics. And yet, the public seemed to enjoy in his work. So did some of his fellow artists – as critic Peter Schjeldah admitted: “My tipping point regarding Rockwell had come in conversation with Willem de Kooning. Our greatest modern painter quite adored Rockwell—as he did most things about the United States since arriving here, as a twenty-two-year-old Dutch stowaway, in 1926.”[3] In 1943, during World War II, inspired by a speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt (wherein he described four universal principles, also known as Four Freedoms: Freedom from Want, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship and Freedom from Fear), Rockwell painted the Four Freedom series. Painted Freedoms, showing some of the basic values of the American people, were quite famous. Actually, his entire body of work reflects the golden glow of pre- and post-WWII Americana. Depicting life as he wanted it to be, Rockwell chronicled iconic visions of American life: the Thanksgiving turkey, soda fountains, ice skating on the pond, and small-town boys playing baseball.[4]   Norman Rockwell helped preserve American myths, but, more than that, he recreated them and made them palatable for new generations. His function was to reassure people, to remind them of old values in times of rapid change. In times of civil rights movement, the space program, the Vietnam War and the Middle East conflicts, Rockwell confronted topics far beyond the cozy parameters he'd previously pictured. And he rose to the challenge, proving his talent over and over. His reputation continued growing after his death. As the mid-20th-century distinctions between fine and applied art became less important in the multi-faceted post-modern art scene, and Rockwell’s paintings reached previously unimaginable heights, leading museums, collectors, and experts felt the need to reconsider his place in both history and their collections. Today, Norman Rockwell is known as an artist who was nearly as prolific as he was talented, and whose oeuvre depicts all the good sides of the American life.   References:  ",1406
Michael De Feo,"Michael De Feo, also known as the Flower Guy, is an American street artist famous for his stylized, iconic flower imagery that can be found in many international urban locations but also inside various magazines. The artist has been working for more than two decades on the streets of numerous major cities, such as New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Cabo San Lucas, Amsterdam, Paris, Venice, Buenos Aires, and Hong Kong. His most recent works from 2015 and 2016, similarly to Vermibus’ pieces, revolve around the takeover of fashion advertising panels found around bus stops in NYC.  Micheal De Feo lives in New York City with his wife Lia and daughter Marianna and he is a regular supporter of various non-profit organizations, such as Friends of the High Line, The Children's Museum of The Arts and The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, to name a few. Even though he became publicly recognized for his flower imagery, the artist has created a variety of other works which reflect his interest in the fashion and advertising industry. His illegal public interventions consist of hijacking advertising panels and painting over trendy fashion photographs. However, not all of his pieces are illegal – he also participates in sponsored partnerships. For instance, in 2016, he designed a line of women's accessories that will be launched in Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom stores. The additional fashion projects from 2016 are De Feo’s takeover of Neiman Marcus' catalog and his collaboration on a campaign for the eminent designer Christian Louboutin. The culmination of De Feo’s interest in fashion was his designing of the accessories line called eMichael De Feo for Echo. This innovative line is still available at Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor and similar high-end stores. Besides his fashion-related projects, De Feo is also engaged in book writing. His children's book named Alphabet City: Out on the Streets won many awards. Throughout this adorable book, De Feo uses New York City as his canvas. His paintings on the streets of Big Apple represent each letter of the alphabet, which is a very insightful aid when it comes to learning the alphabet.   De Feo’s work is far from being a regular street art. His pieces aren’t bound to appear only on the streets – the artist is also a regular exhibitor in a wide range of galleries and museums, such as The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, CT, MASS MoCA in North Adams, MA, Museo de Arte in San Juan, Puerto Rico and also Colette in Paris and Stolen Space in London. De Feo’s most successful exhibits were Wooster on Spring at New York's Candle Building, which is considered one of top 10 cultural events in 2006. The same goes for 10 Years of Wooster collective exhibit, held at Jonathan Levine Gallery in New York, in 2013. De Feo’s work is also a part of numerous media outlets, primarily magazine covers. His best-known works when it comes to magazines includes NewYork Magazine’s Reasons to Love New York, then The New York Times and The London Sunday Times, as well as TIME Magazine. De Feo is interested in the film industry as well and considers is another suitable platform for his artworks. His pieces have appeared in documentaries such as Alice Arnold's To Be Seen and legendary Banksy's Exit Through The Gift Shop. In 2014, thanks to the excellence of De Feo’s work, Russell Simmons and The Rush Arts Philanthropy Foundation selected him as their featured artist.   De Feo’s work has gone through an exciting evolution – he started small and his first pieces were mostly illegal, but his innovative style became recognizable and highly appraised. Ever since the early 2000s, Michael has been having a lot of group and solo shows. In June 2016, he had an exhibition at Rice Gallery in Houston, while in July 2016 he’s about to have a new solo show at Danziger Gallery in New York, dedicated to his new imaginatively colorful pieces.

Charles Cham,"Charles Cham, a Malaysian painter, creates puzzlingly primitive artworks that resemble the images from the walls of prehistoric caves. His human figures and faces consist of simple geometric forms, while his use of colors is bold and temperamental, full of contrasting hues. I believe that drawing is thinking and painting is feeling. Therefore, I draw what I think and paint what I feel, says Charles Cham about his working technique. In addition to his childlike and simplistic artworks, the artist is also known as the founder of the Orangutan House, a gallery located in the historical downtown of the city of Malacca.  Charles Cham was born in Malaysia in 1962. He was an extremely imaginative kid – when he was just five years old, he already showed an interest in visual arts, movies and artwork. In his early work, he painted various faces he saw in movies. The artist didn’t use only pencils and colors to create his childhood artworks – he also played with his mother’s cake powder, using it as a paint and creating a wide range of improvised mixed-media pieces at his house. Cham followed his dreams for many years and eventually became an editorial artist in Kuala Lumpur. After a while, the artist decided to make a change in his life and relocate to France in order to further his education and training in painting. He became a member of the prestigious Association des Artistes Indépendants in Aix-en-Provence in France. Thanks to this institution located far away from his home, he exhibited his works at the Salon des Independents in 1990 and 1991.  [caption id=""attachment_308106"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""865""] Charles Cham - Silent Passion, 1997 (Left) / Tension in the Night, 1998 (Right)[/caption]  In 1992, Charles Cham founded The Orangutan House in his hometown in Malaysia. This artistic haven located in the historical downtown of Malacca is both his studio and gallery. Nowadays, it also represents one of the most recognizable and most beautiful buildings in Malacca, due to its unusual architecture. Talking about the nature of Cham’s artworks, it investigates the sign of duality of life and the attraction of the opposites – which is known as the Yin and Yang in Eastern philosophy and culture. The Yin and Yang paintings are actually multiple paintings. They are in fact two oil paintings on one canvas, with each other facing in the opposite direction, explain Chan the common composition of his pieces, which often contain the elements of reversed figures and contrasting colors, metaphorically representing the sign of duality and the contact of the opposites.   Charles Cham has exhibited his artworks in many Asian and European countries - in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Australia, France, the UK, Switzerland, Portugal and of course his home country. His oil paintings can be found in the collections of various international art connoisseurs in more than 40 countries. Cham’s work is highly appreciated for being evocative of the rich tribal cultures, feel and history of Southeast Asia. Also, his childlike and simplistic vision makes his work emotionally intense and comprehensible on a primal, intuitive level.  ",1408
Maaike Bakker,"Hailing from Pretoria, the administrative capital of South Africa, Maaike Bakker is a highly talented artist who works in a wide range of media including drawing, sculpture and installation. However, she is best known for her illustrations featuring metaphorical subjects and elements that may remind many viewers of fairy-tale motifs. The artist uses a soft palette of colors to create her eye-catching pieces that often explore themes of notation and ephemerality. Her work also deals with limitations imposed by systems and aims to find out at what point such structures may become excessive and irrelevant, eventually examining futility.  Born in 1986, South African artist obtained a degree in Visual Arts in 2009, and an MA in Fine Art from the University of Johannesburg in 2013. During her studies, Bakker started exploring illustration alongside her fine art practice in order to be able to discover a new, lighter and more eclectic approach to her work. Over the years, Bakker has developed her own style that introduces both concept-driven works as well as light-hearted, offbeat, rough works that depict sceneries from alternative realities. She adds complexity to her art by using line to create patterns, while her soft muted colors give a lush richness to each piece.    In November 2013, Maaike Bakker had a one-man show entitled Now Museum | Now You Don’t, as part of her Master’s degree, at the Nirox Projects (JHB). Since then, her oeuvre has been included in many exhibitions in South Africa, Germany and the United Kingdom. Selected recent group shows include From Whence They Came at SMITH Studio, Cape Town (2016), ZeRO at SOMA art space, Maboneng, Johannesburg (2016), Post-digital at Kalashnikovv gallery, JHB (2015), Play_an exhibition at Nirox sculpture park, Muldersdrift (2014), Re-sample at ABSA Gallery, JHB (2013), Cape 09 as part of the City Project, Cape Town (2009) and many others. In April 2012, she collaborated with Louis Minnaar on a two-person illustration show, titled The River, at Salon91.   Amongst her illustration work, the Pretoria-born artist’s creative output ranges from installation and conceptual art to more light-hearted, offbeat illustrations and raw paintings. To date, she’s curated a number of drawing and illustration exhibitions, including lectures in illustration. Along with such artists as Werner Burger, Nina Torr, Lodewyk Barkhuizen and PJ Kotze, she is a member of Mega Bonanza, an art collective focused on creating non-academic brutal and pointless art together. She was selected as a finalist for the Sasol New Signatures competition during 2005 and 2009, and also made it to the top 10 of the prestigious Absa L’atelier art competition during 2009. The artist is represented by Kalashnikovv gallery.   ",1409

Sarah Moon,"French fashion photographer Sarah Moon is known for her ethereal, painterly aesthetic. The artist rose to prominence during the 1970s when she created the signature advertising ""look” for fashion houses Cacharel, Comme des Garçons, and Chanel. The artist's photographs are characterized by soft focus, magical, romantic imagery, and jewel tones. Her work has been published in numerous fashion magazines, including Vogue, Life, Elle, Marie-Claire, Harper's Bazaar, and Graphis. Also, she is the author of several books, such as Vrais Semblants (1991), Improbable Memories (1980), Inventario (1997), Photopoche (1998), and Little Red Riding Hood (1986). In 1985 the artist received the International Center of Photography's Infinity Award for Applied Photography and ten years later the Grand Prix National de la Photographie in 1995.   Born in 1941 in Vernon, France, Marielle Warin changed her name to Sarah Moon in the 70s when she entered the world of fashion modeling. However, she became interested in photography and decided to pursue that career full-time in 1968. Moon was the first woman to take photographs for the Pirelli calendar. The artist soon began working for major fashion houses, such as Dior, Chanel, and Comme des Garçons. During the 1970s, she also worked closely with Barbara Hulanicki, the founder of clothes store Biba. Sarah Moon's photography was well received in the fashion world for its painterly quality. Compositions in her work do not show a full figure of the model but rather zooms on the angles and gestures of the body.   Sarah Moon's photographs lay on the border between truth and fiction. In her poetic, dream-like world there is always a touch of reality as though the artist is attempting to touch the boundary between death and birth. The mystery and dream-like qualities are always present, inviting the viewers to immerse themselves in these timeless moments. Thus, it becomes obvious that one of Moon’s biggest inspirations is the book Alice in Wonderland. About the choice of color, Moon explains: When I shoot flowers or any still life, or fashion, color forces me to be more abstract, I have to make the effort to transpose it, in order to get closer to what it was that first impressed me.  For me, black and white is closer to introspection, to memories, to loneliness and loss, I don't see the same in color - it's another language, a living language   From the 1990s, the artist has begun making short and feature-length movies. Mississipi One is Sarah Moon’s feature film about a man who kidnaps his daughter after escaping a mental institution. The artist’s visual esthetic contributed to the audience's confusion if what they are seeing is real or it is just the hero’s dream. Moon has also directed numerous television commercials, a film about photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, and 5 short films inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen's fables. Sarah Moon currently lives and works in Paris, France.   ",1411

Seth Armstrong,"The artist who knows how to combine hyperrealism and surrealism is definitely Seth Armstrong. Although he sometimes changes his style, texture, and surfaces on which he works, what is constant in his paintings is the motif represented in the exploration of his surrounding, especially Los Angeles. His art shows the depth, beauty, and vacancy of big cities, revealing the secrets and tensions caught in the moment between action and inertia. The author is also famous for the voyeuristic elements that he includes in his art with incredible precision and details. The amazing traditional painting technique skills are transferred to canvas in shine colors and contrasts, thus blending them with the landscapes.   He was born and raised in LA, California. For some time he studied painting in Northern Holland, before receiving BFA from the California College of the Arts in San Francisco. Seth has chosen a looser, more painterly approach that helps him capture the dense of light and color. Controlled manipulation of dimension, alongside stylized hyper colors, which exceed the muted tones of the real, evokes the feelings of nostalgia and strangeness at the same time. Armstrong continuously explores themes that fascinate him, the intrigue of illicit looking that is on the edge of erasing lines between trespass and intimacy. Each of his pieces is a part of a larger narrative, in which tension and excitement increase as the expectation of some action grows.    As the artist admits in an interview, the city of Los Angeles is what inspires him the most. It is a place that after being absent for nine years he can call a home. And it is not only the aesthetic that he is fascinated with, but also its history, so naturally, it had to find a way to be present in his oil paintings. Besides this, since he was young he depicted battle scenes between imagery stick figures armies. Armstrong gradually moved to drawing comic books, eventually coming to painting superheroes and girls. The project called Pretty Deep Shit is about author’s observation of LA, showing more cohesive and intimate arrest of the city, with all its freedom and fluidity which differs it from the others. In his another show The Air is Thick the accent is on voyeurism that captures people’s state of mind.    Seth succeeds to make his artworks look as if they are fragments taken from movies that the audience sees in cinemas. His ideas create sublime narrative art of high quality and even bigger impact. Author’s paintings have been displayed in galleries and museums throughout the US, like at the Gallery Heist, in 2011 and Spoke Art, SF in 2012, the Vertical Gallery, Chicago in 2016, at the Bold Hype, New York in 2013, but also in other parts of the world like at the Urban Nation, Berlin in 2014, at the StolenSpace Gallery, London in 2015 and in many other places. He is represented by the Thinkspace Gallery.  ",1416
Nancy Gifford,"Inspired by poetry and the world at large, Nancy Gifford is an artist who enjoys using materials in a way they were not meant to be used. Initially driven by an idea that her art needs to be informed by grids and rows of changing color and form, Nancy Gifford managed to break free of the grid and is now recognized for her boundless visual vocabulary. She is heavily influenced by her love for poetry, as explained by Nancy herself: I like to say… painting is the refuge of the failed poet…. What artist would not rather be a poet? Art is so laborious, at least the kind of art I do…   Nancy Gifford studied psychology and art at Kent State University, after which she spent the next eight years living abroad. Working as a model allowed young Nancy to leave the farm and become a part of the culture world, meeting numerous filmmakers, dancers, writers, poets, musicians and artists along the way. This experience, combined with the visits to the museums and galleries of Europe, was what shaped Nancy Gifford’s artistic vocabulary. Her mixed-media art career began in Los Angeles in the year of 1980 when Nancy started doing political and environmental work.  As for her inspirations, Gifford views the works of Eva Hesse as a vital source - her work helped Nancy realize that using paint is not always a mandatory action. Other influences were Jenny Holzer’s inclusion of text, Joseph Beuys’s pathos, Ann Hamilton’s grace, Marcel Duchamp’s humor, Julian Schnabel’s bits of advice and Anselm Kiefer’s scope.  My art is primarily narrative.  The narrative informs the medium to a great extent.  The narrative derives from my own history, from literature and poetry and also from the world at large. This is the way Nancy Gifford explains her art’s style and nature. She tends to work in series, though the series can span many decades and often re-emerge, so no project is truly conclusive. As it was clued at earlier, environmental and political themes seem to present the core of Nancy’s art, at least so far in her career. Technically speaking, repetition plays a big role in her art, a feature that resembles rhythm and is Gifford’s way of paying homage to poetry.    I like to say I love anarchy but hate chaos.  This is very true in my art.  My thoughts may not be ordered but their execution often is. A very intriguing and clever statement made by the artist herself, this may be the most precise way to define Nancy Gifford’s body of work. In charge of her controlled turmoil, Nancy's hope is to lift spirits and incite her viewers:  Mostly, I hope to inspire…  if I can do what I do from where I came…  then anyone can…  also, I like to provoke a smile when I can.  But some messages are just too serious for that…    ",1417
Budd Hopkins,"American artist Budd Hopkins was a world-renowned Abstract Expressionist painter, sculptor, and prominent investigator of alien abduction phenomena and related UFO events. In the field of abstract art, he won wide acclaim and several distinguished grants, among them a fellowship from the National Endowment of the Arts and the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. His style was imbued with the emotional dynamism of the 1950s, the cool sensibility of the 1960s, and the linear geometrics of the 1970s. The artist has exhibited in numerous art museums and galleries in the United States and Europe. Today his work is part of several private and public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.   Budd Hopkins, who was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1931, graduated from Linsly Military Institute and in 1953 from Oberlin College with a bachelor's degree in art history. During his studies, he had the fortune to attend Robert Motherwell's lecture, where he was introduced to the artist's gestural, automatic approach to painting. After moving to New York, he entered Columbia University, where he met several prominent artists, such as Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, and Franz Kline. The artist first rose to prominence for his experimentation with collage techniques. In 1956 he had his first solo exhibition at Poindexter Gallery in New York, which was a huge success, and he quickly received recognition. About his technique, Hopkins said:     For Hopkins, the college is not only a technique but a philosophical tool able to unify a disjointed and fragmented world. For the artist, ""the presence of the collage aesthetic is the sole defining quality of modernism in all the arts."" The paintings he created during the 1960s featured a mix of a bold and rich palette and hard-edged geometric compositions. In the following decade, he began creating paintings that incorporated architectural elements, such as the series of Assembled Paintings. In style resembling that of Piet Mondrian, he favored primary color and circular shapes against a black or white background. Later in his career, the artist began creating large-scale sculptures that incorporated the elements of abstract. The sculpture titled Temple of Apollo With Guardian XXXXV created in 1985, seemed to have come straight from a primordial myth.   Hopkins, who exhibited in numerous galleries worldwide, including Galerie Liatowitsch in Basel, and Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, was a prominent writer and expert on UFOs. He published several books, such as Sight Unseen: Science, UFO Invisibility, Transgenic Beings, Missing Time: A Documented Study of UFO Abductions, and Witnessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions. The book Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods became a bestseller and inspiration for a tv show. Budd Hopkins passed away in 2011. ",1418

Roberta Morzetti,"Roberta Morzetti's art exposes us to an art production that transforms materials into incredible sculptures. The first creative impetus is born in her experience and her memories, which constantly watch over the process of conception, so there is symbiosis and synthesis between creativity that needs has to be transformed. She mainly prefers the feminine element and always starting from her mold, proceeding to shape a final figure which is usually a result of a deep study of classic icons in a contemporary and personal style.  The use of white and plaster attenuates the inner personal drama of the artist who creates mainly as a consequence of personal life experiences, which give her inspiration and estrus. The use of osidric flame in her latest works is the witness of the artist’s desire to magnify the drama of her creations, it is a way to dramatize the absolute perfection of the white stucco.  R.M. fastens together various materials with a personal skill, which combines a traditional sculpture technique melted to her personal touch. The Medium and artistic technique developed by Roberta Morzetti refers to an art tradition of assembling various elements reworked in a maniacal mean, to finally create a sculptured figure, which is already impressed in her mind. The result is a three-dimensional sculpture in which it is possible to enter inside its deep soul.  It is clear that what is most urgent to Roberta is to transfigure a rebellion through the beauty of her art, but it is still a denunciation, an acknowledgment, a reference to conscience and to superior morality. All this makes this young artist a vate, with her burden of pain and memories and with her courage to show them to the world. ",1422
Wang Ai,"A respected Chinese poet and artist, Wang Ai is known for delicate paintings made with rice paper, tea, Chinese ink and special pencils. Characterized by harmony and balance, these works combine ancient landscapes, animals, and scriptural texts with contemporary elements, demonstrating the fascinating and captivating contradictions. Presenting a thoughtful use of color, his works reveal intriguing visual perceptions, varying according to the distance from which the painting is observed. From afar, these paintings appear as Color Field works, while, up close, they unveil an unexpected variety of details. These range from representations of animals to fragments of landscapes and imaginary figures. Playing with the power of language, Ai continuously deconstructs and re-constructs it by depicting extracts of poems and Buddhist sutras. Exploring boundaries of tradition and modernity, he presents the dark, the obscure, the invisible, and the unsayable. He creates symbolic connections between man, the natural world and society, filtering reality through an ethereal mirror. ",1423
Marko Tadic,"One of the most prominent Croatian artists of the younger generation, Marko Tadić's practice spans drawing, installation and animation.

Amy Bennett,"An American contemporary artist, Amy Bennett, creates paintings of interior scenes and rural and suburban landscapes, exploring memory, narrative, themes of suburban life, and an awareness of our changing surroundings. Today her work is included in several private and public collections, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY. The artist is the recipient of several fellowships, such as the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (Fine Arts) and the New York State Council on the Arts/New York Foundation for the Arts Artist Fellowship and the and the Prince of Wales Scholarship to Normandy (2003).   Amy Bennett holds a BFA from the University of Hartford, Hartford, CT, and an MFA from the New York Academy of Art, New York, NY. Similar to the works of Thomas Demand, James Casebere, Malcolm Morley, and Laurie Simmonds, Bennett explores model-based practices. For such a detailed and precise work complete control over light and composition is necessary, as well as point of view. Bennett is a master at evoking an uneasy sense of unnaturalness through clever use of high-angled perspectives. Thus paintings seem to be snapshots taken from a low-flying aircraft. The artist is inspired by the life in upstate New York, which she finds perfectly reflects the sense of isolation even in a highly-populated area.   Using complex three-dimensional miniatures, Bennett creates her artworks through a painstaking two-stage process. Using cardboard, wood, styrofoam, plastic, string, paint, glue, and model railroad miniatures, she creates scale models and dioramas of fictional places, populating them with figures acting out local history and snippets of narratives. Examining themes such as time, isolation, and transition, the artist is interested in the fragility of relationships and people’s awkwardness in trying to coexist and relate to one another. Featuring a town, neighborhood, lake, theater, doctor’s office, church, and numerous domestic interiors, the scenes she creates feel like a believable, but alternate, fabricated world. The artist’s earlier paintings were more narrative-driven. The viewer would often question what happened just before or after the painting was created. Bennet is highly interested in storytelling. She uses the same model of a person or an object and tells their story as it develops over time, through different angles.   Whether the artwork depicts scenes of domestic bliss like in Nuclear Family (2019), or domestic violence as seen in Against the Wall (2006), or death in Paying Respects (2006), the artist’s work always has a strong voyeuristic quality. The artist has opened the door into the private lives of figures frozen in time. Like through a window, the viewer can gape at suburban, small-town life that has an almost sinister undercurrent lurking, always reminded of the impermanence of everything. Amy Bennett has exhibited her work in a range of venues, including Miles McEnery Gallery, New York, Richard Heller Gallery, Santa Monica, Galleri Magnus Karlsson, Stockholm, Tomio Koyama Gallery, Tokyo, and Linda Warren Gallery, Chicago. Amy Bennett currently lives and works in Cold Spring, New York.  ",1425
Annie Lapin,"An American artist, Annie Lapin creates abstract paintings grounded in representation. Residing in a world of multiplicities, her trompe l’oeil spaces combine digital histories and analog mark making, abiding neither to the rules of the virtual nor to the physical.

She holds a BA from Yale University, New Haven, CT, Post-Baccalaureate Certificate from School of the Art Institute of Chicago, IL and an MFA from University of California, Los Angeles, CA. She exhibited around the world, including Miles McEnery Gallery, New York, Josh Lilley, London, UK, Annarumma Gallery, Naples, Italy, Yautepec Gallery, Mexico City, Mexico, Pasadena Museum of California Art, Pasadena, CA and Weatherspoon Art Museum, Greensboro, NC. Pulling from an array of art historical and cultural references, Lapin combines seemingly representational and highly rendered imagery such as forests or figures with the abstract. She constructs an image in multiple conflicting idioms, combining computerized tools with older rendering styles. Investigating how the image of a painting comes to be, the artist creates a destabilizing and nonhierarchical viewing space where the viewer feels a sensation of a shifting grounds. Having a great technical mastery, she deploys a wide range of media including oil, acrylic, flashe, charcoal, glass, and enamel. ",1426
Ryan Brown,"An American conceptual artist, Ryan Brown's practice spans performances, paintings, sculptures, photographic series, and installations that both honor and interrogate modern and contemporary art and artists, as well as the historical narratives, manifestos, and market systems upon which they rely. Born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania in 1977, Brown studied Fine Arts at SVA (School of Visual Arts) in New York. After graduating with honors in 2006 he was invited to participate in the European Exchange Academy in Beelitz, Germany. Ryan Brown has participated in multiple solo and group exhibitions, including  Bryce Wolkowitz Gallery, New York, NY, USA, Max Estrella Gallery, Madrid, Spain, Y Gallery, New York, USA, Galería OMR, Mexico City, Mexico, and Solo Project, Miami Beach. Using satire and mimicry, Brown interrogates the preciousness, arrogance, and politics underlying the presentation and consideration of art. He is also known for filming himself performing as such famous artists as Jackson Pollock, raising awareness of the frequent blurring of truth and myth in the record of an artist’s life and work.

Sasha Holzer,"A British contemporary artist born in 1959, Sasha Holzer is known for his carefully carved wooden panels. His works reveal a profound and meticulous knowledge of the properties of the materials used.  Holzer's works are created through a hand-made and time-consuming processes. Using the traditional process of carving, he employs an unfamiliar tactile quality as part of his often geometric and highly contextualised pieces. The geometric structure of his works has recently relaxed and has begun to suggest the emergence of figurative elements, often with Arcadian associations. Never seeking out recognition and quietly pursuing his own self-generating goals, he works in total seclusion from the artworld and the pressures of exhibiting.

Cinthia Marcelle,"A Brazilian multimedia artist focusing in photography, video, and installation work, Cinthia Marcelle uses her mediums to document the effects that her interventions have on the usual order of things.

Melvin Grave Guzman,"Melvin ""Grave"" Guzman is an American contemporary artist born in Harlem, New York, working in photography, performance, and monumental mixed-media. Even though he’s pursuing a range of distinctive technical practices, his work consistently explores the oscillating relationship between city and self, between environment and identity in Digital Age. Most of his work is created from found materials such as torn magazine ads, shopping bags, boxes, and posters once discarded by consumer society. Finding them on the streets, Guzman enjoys working with these materials as they are powerful because of their history. Considered as relics of this day and age, they are saved by the artist, re-purposed in his thoughtful constructions, and preserved for the future. These absurdist creations reflect the distorted image of our false appetites in real-time, emphasizing the influence of contemporary media on our lives.",1465

Serenely contemplative, his pieces are imbued with a dry, subtle sense of humor, and their imagery is rooted in his early years growing up on the family farm on Roberts Island in the California Delta. These experiences are deeply ingrained in his subconscious – memories such as fear and hope experienced living through times of flood and drought or his visceral reaction to the cracks in the ditches that naturally resulted from the interaction of dirt, water, and sun. The general theme employed in David Phelps’ works “is a sense of perseverance, optimism, and humor being embraced in the face of adversity.”   ",1467

The top coat is a multi-layered resin that gives an almost “glass-like” feel to each piece. Rausch’s finished pieces, whether considered paintings and sculptures, take on a personality of their own as light hits the surface. He graduated with honors from the Art Academy of Cincinnati.

Calvin Teng,"Born in Guangdong, Calvin Teng is a Taiwanese contemporary artist widely known and recognized for his serene abstract paintings. He has adopted a unique approach, depicting the sublime beauty of landscapes by transcending their original outlines into abstract forms and spirits.

At once personal, political and universal, Ferrell's work explores masculinity and gay identity. These digitally collaged paintings draw from disparate images sourced from the Internet, Instagram, and Ferrell’s own camera. Beautifully rendered and imbued with a homo-erotic glow, his figures are situated in lush landscapes, characterized by colorful gradients and intricate patterns. Loosely basing his works on his own relationships, experiences, and imagination, the artist explores a range of dichotomies - public/private, nature/culture, taste/ kitsch, transparency/opacity. His works conjure up feelings of youthful nostalgia, while telling of a real story of struggle, otherness and self-love. ",1470

Raymond Saa,"Raymond Saá is a Cuban-American artist whose paintings and works on paper form a complex, multilayered formal environment for the viewer to decipher. Using an X-Acto knife as a drawing implement, he creates images that are often sewn together into ‘postcards.’ In these works on paper, both the positive and negative images are important for creating the piece. Saá overlaps and sews the sewn composites, creating a pattern reminiscent of shingles. His paintings are extensions of the drawing and pattern-making process of the works on paper, where the compositions are derived from details found in the paper works and are built or stacked from the bottom upward. Different elements stack against each other creating rhythm and tension within the composition, while the color, shape, line, and pattern remain the focus of the work. Born in New Orleans and raised in Miami, Raymond Saá currently lives and works in New Jersey.",1472

This testament to the Mayan way has made her an internationally known photographer. Her work has been critically acclaimed in galleries from England, Germany and Iceland to the Netherlands, South Africa and Spain. Her first project Creencias de nuestros antepasados (The Beliefs of Our Ancestors), which she began in 1994, seeks to document and compile the traditions of the Tzotzil people, traditions which the elders have endeavored to pass on and the younger generations are losing.

By combining his own bold, block colors with recognizable interiors, Taylor has managed to create a world where the figures exist in such a way as to comment on the negative progression that has formed in parts of society.

Arnaud Laly,"Always imagining, creating, and moving, Arnaud Laly is a French graphic designer and artist who approaches his work via triptych: line – pattern – flat colors. At first, he studied Applied Arts in Rennes, specializing in graphic design, before studying plastic art and global design to expand his vision. After settling in Paris, he became an Artistic Director in a large agency (2017). Laly’s been working as a freelancer since 2014. Frustrated about the artificiality of creating through a computer screen, he finds balance by painting on canvas and rugs. Only in painting does he find the power of colors and contrast, which allow him to convey a particular emotion. Using the rigor resulting from design, the artist often represents deconstructed faces in a contemporary way, sets of looks, or even abstract compositions. He is strongly influenced by architecture and artistic trends such as De Stijl, Cubism, or Memphis. Featured image: Arnaud Laly - portrait. Image courtesy Day2Day Gallery",1482
Valco,"Compulsive and spontaneous, Valco is a French self-taught artist who evolves his works through emotions and research. His pieces instinctively bring to mind comic book characters mixed with the style of 80’s New York street artists. He mainly uses themes and subjects that refer to those years, creating colorful overlays where different messages can emerge and viewers can give each canvas a different meaning. Coming from a popular background, he likes to represent fictional characters popularized by TV. Influenced by the hip-hop movement, his expression remains “streetly.” At the age of 10, Valco began to draw the characters from the famous Asterix comics, and four years later, he began tagging bus shelters, learning lettering alongside a childhood friend. He also observed other graffiti artists, admiring their work. Valco preserves his pseudo-anonymity, as his artist name is just an anagram of his last name. Featured image: Valco - portrait.

Lorenzo Swinton,"Lorenzo Swinton is an American self-taught artist specializing in abstract and contemporary paintings using acrylics as his force for the stimulating and invigorating visuals he creates. His aptitude, interests, and passion for artistry became established from the early age of six when his very first art presentation was displayed at the State County Fair in Winston Salem, North Carolina, his hometown. Beginning with these drawings, followed by writing poetry in adolescence, to even composing music during his early adult years, Swinton’s hunger for art continues to grow. Influenced by his thoughts and surroundings, the artist produces expressive pieces. “Sometimes I have days where I feel I am in tune with myself and surroundings, then there are those moments in time where everything feels off, uncontrollable, dark, distant.” Feeding off his emotions of “happiness, tranquility, beauty, anger, frustration, sadness, exhaustion, to name a few,” he finds it to be “extremely therapeutic to be able to release different energies on canvas and I believe people have the opportunity to explore their own perception(s) both visually and mentally through my aesthetics.” Lorenzo Swinton lives and works in Clarksville, Tennessee.

Sam Heydt,"Sam Heydt is an American social practice and recycled media artist working in media such as film, video, installation, photography, sculpture, sound, merchandize, text. Looking beyond the ordinary, she utilizes a range of materials, often reinventing or trespassing their associative use. One of the pioneers of the recycled media movement, Heydt combines “images of destruction with portrayals of the virtues born from the American Dream,” confronting the “disillusionment of our time with the ecological and existential nightmare it is responsible for.” Having realized that we’re living in a world exploited beyond use, marked by mass extinction, product fetishism, diminishing resources, and patented seeds, she chose to anchor her art in social advocacy, attempting to give a voice to the veiled, forgotten, exiled and silenced. Her academic career traversed Parsons School of Design, The New School, Cooper Union, University of Amsterdam, Universidad of Buenos Aires, and La Sorbonne.

Amidst an otherwise conservative and often closed traditional society, Zhipeng offers his point of view on alternative youth spirit and culture. This younger generation indulges ""in love and life, oscillating between jubilation and deep melancholy, playful sexuality and often just the simple human need to be loved in an otherwise indifferent and ever-changing society.""

George Byrne,"George Byrne is an Australian artist whose photographs juxtapose the vivid clarity of modernist painting against the New Topographics photography movement, using subject matter deeply entrenched in the urban everyday. As he admits, he’d “always been interested in landscape photography, but it wasn’t until I moved to LA and started shooting in color and experimenting with manipulation and assemblage that I felt I was able to do anything very expressive or original with it.” His current line of work and imagery is quite removed from reality, but Byrne tends “to bury the lead and let the seams distract. Hence the effect is hopefully one of pleasure and disconcertion. They are dreamscapes.” Born in Sydney, he studied at Sydney College Of The Arts, graduating in 2001.

""They are a base for me to visually and conceptually illustrate dualities."" Visually, she harmonizes realism and abstraction, combining the characteristics of paint and mark-making. Conceptually, painting is where she enacts what is relevant in her own life - accepting destruction as a catalyst for creation, allowing attachments and relinquishing them, and balancing intellectualism with spontaneous playfulness.

Marc Dennis,"An American contemporary artist, Marc Dennis is best known for his hyper-realistic paintings of staged and slightly voyeuristic images of contemporary American culture, including individuals engaged in viewing iconic works of art. Through these works, he celebrates the subversive potential of beauty and sexuality and explores the charged subjects of identity, pleasure and power. Dennis combines various movements throughout the western art historical canon to create fresh paintings rich with hype and narrative. Combining elements from the Renaissance, Pre-Raphaelites, Grimm's Fairy Tales and Disney, he sets out to create paintings that are immediate and visceral. These reflect a paradox of dualities–the believable and non-believable, the real and the staged, and the serious and the comical. His compositions often include images that hide within images, engaging his viewers in a game of pop culture and art historical references. Marc's artistic inspiration is also drawn from his many adventures and personal experiences, such as his childhood obsession with looking underneath rocks and logs which are translated into scientific renderings of flora and fauna, often rendered in dramatic Baroque light. Highly detailed and inventively imaginative, Dennis’s paintings are imbued with a mysteriously alluring passion.

Wanting to become an artist from an early age, she enrolled at the National Academy of Design's art course with Charles Hawthorne and Edwin Dickinson and later at Art Students League where Hawthorne was also teaching. In 1930, on her first visit to Paris, she met and became the partner of the British novelist Ford Madox Ford. Upon Ford’s death in 1939, she returned to New York, immersing herself in the art scene during World War II. She became one of the few women associated with the New York School, befriending painters Willem de Kooning and critic Harold Rosenberg, among others. Traveling through France, Spain, Italy, and Morocco, Biala captured the unique light in each city while rendering its signature landmarks in bold, simplified shapes. Developing a unique semi-abstract style characterized by by bold brushstrokes combined with a spare, economic domestic intimacy, she synthesized the styles popular in the circles she orbited—the early 20th-century Parisian avant-garde and the mid-century New York School.

He was awarded the Contemporary Chinese Art Award (CCAA) as “Best Young Artist” in 2014. An observer, a researcher and a collector, he often draws from his array of found objects to create his installations, building connections among previously unrelated pieces, or even repairing or altering them. Following Chinese tradition, Ni also studies and emulates the work of old Chinese masters, immersing himself in them to extract their essence. His practice is equally informed by the tradition of landscape in art history as well as post-1960s conceptual art, such as the Italian modern art movement Arte Povera. He seems intent on avoiding temporal marks in his oeuvre, instead imbuing his artworks with an abstract trace, often leaving the viewer with a spatial and temporal illusion. He describes these works as ""de-temporary"" creation. ",1536
Dong Dawei,"A Chinese mixed-media artist, Dong Dawei has developed a highly personal visual language from a distinct methodology, which was coincidentally born out of an accidental ink stain.

Dawei's practice is procedural and time-based, comprised of a rigorously planned replication of single elements to attain diversity. While working on a piece, he tries to keep his hand as still as possible, whilst scrutinizing the growing stain to controlled timing. After the marker is lifted, the ink stain continues to grow until it meets the previous one.  ",1537

His works have been included in a range of shows all over the world, including Rome, Marseille, London, Cologne, Innsbruck, Zurich, Los Angeles, and New York. Soto Ciment creates objects, installations, sculptures and photographs sourcing materials and imagery from the quotidian. Sourcing materials and images mainly from city streets or urban suburbs, he uses art strategies like appropriation and juxtaposition through re-contextualization and delicate rearrangement to create works that explore questions of temporality, desire, decay and marginality. His interventions into everyday objects are occasionally temporary, and these works often feature objects that can be returned to their original state. His works created from vintage clothes are often imbued with sexual tension. He seeks to unleash and share the invisible energy, already present. ",1538
Jacques Jean Efiaimbelo,"A modern artist from Madagascar, Jacques Jean Efiaimbelo created work deeply rooted in the Mahafaly culture of his ancestors. He sough to both honor and extend the ritual of the aloalos, funerary steles that serve as grave makers that represent particular memories of the deceased. The tradition of aloalos has been transmitted from father to son for generations. Coming from a family of traditional sculptors, Efiaimbelo learned his practice from his great grandfather Soroboko. Over the years, he developed his art practice and passed it on to his son Jacques Jean Efiaimbelo, and his grandson Jean Colomb Efiaimbelo. Today, only five members of the clan perpetuate this unique practice in the same style as their distinguished inspirer. Efiaimbelo is one of the first sculptors that began painting aloalos for decorative purposes, introducing acrylic colors and new imagery into the genre. Using Mendorave, a very dense, rare and sacred wood exclusively cut and handled by sculptors, he creates vertical sculptures that reaches about 2 meters high. Divided in two distinct parts, they are comprised of the base which is a pole and the upper middle part carved into eight successive geometric motifs painted in vivid colors. On the top of the pole, there is a horizontal platter of varying dimensions, featuring a figurative scene depicting a moment of daily life, a tale, a legend, ancestral wisdom, or a stories shared by members of the Termaromainte clan.

In her work, Min pays special attention to both color and gestures to engender sensation and articulate surface. Her color choices are energetic and powerful, yet soft and seemingly weightless. In her working process, she often uses squeegees and sprayers to distance the hand and ultimately help to create the ethereal nature of each canvas. ",1540

Influenced by Frank Stella and Richard Anuskewicz, Isensee developed a style of geometric paintings with a trace of the optical. His recent works feature wavering forms that divide the canvas into quadrants, creating leftover spaces that the artist fills with almond-shaped and eye-like units, lozenges, boomerangs, and teardrops. These works juxtapose different color sets in a daring way. ",1541

He had his first solo show at the Kunstverein Region Heinsberg in 1989 and has since shown throughout Germany and Switzerland, as well as at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Lehmann Maupin Gallery in New York, Mai 36 in Zurich and Musée de Grenoble. After he stopped taking his own photographs and began digitally manipulating found images, Sasse developed  process of scanning images into his computer, changing them, and then making film negatives of these manipulated images, from which the final prints are made. These early works mainly used land- and cityscapes taken by friends, acquaintances, and unknown others. His interventions imbue narrative, changing and blurring light, redefining the colors and the cropped section to be used, changing the angle, deleting specific elements or adding new items. Expressing doubts concerning the documentary nature of photography, one of his main questions is, ""Did classical photography ever reproduce what was in front of the camera?"" ",1542
Yann Gerstberger,"A French-born and Mexican-based artist, Yann Gerstberger creates textile tapestries that depict narratives inspired by patterns found in Mexican popular culture, art history and nature. His vocabulary references the Fábulas Pánicas of Jodorowsky, the fantasy of the tropical seen from Europe, postgraffiti and the history of abstraction and its repertoire of ambiguous and mystical shapes.

These cotton fibers are dyed by hand, using a mixture of natural Mexican dyes such as cochineal, and industrial ones like Citocol, the most basic dye that can be found in the supermarket. ",1543

Laura Carralero Morales,"The Cuban artist Laura Carralero Morales systematically deals with the reminiscence of spaces, basing her work on the precise observation of her environment and its subsequent reduction to fundamental spatial experiences.

Dealing with spatial memory in her work, Carralero Morales tries to project her visions of an ideal city onto the canvas. Capturing impressions around her, she transforms them into fragmentary spaces in which fiction and reality, the well-known and the unknown coexist. Reducing the complex and multi-layered environment to fundamental spatial experiences, she paints the contours of architectural spaces which are meant to express the forms and lines of movement on which the cities are based.

His works are part of several public collections, including Gallery Mueller-Roth, Stuttgart, Aargauer Kunsthaus, Aarau, Switzerland, Municipal gallery Villa Zanders , Bergisch Gladbach and Hoffmann Gallery, Friedberg. Bohm's early systematic works draw on a European geometric tradition, governed by the structure of an underlying grid which he establishes at the outset. These works are imbued with dynamic and sometimes confusing effects that are in a characteristic tension with the clarity of their structure. In recent years, his practice has become installation-based. ",1548

Leonid Afremov,"Russian-Israeli modern impressionistic artist, Leonid Afremov, developed his unique technique, working mainly with a palette knife and oils. He was a self-promoting artist that sold his paintings depicting landscapes, seascapes, portraits, flowers, and city scenes solely over the internet. Afremov did not believe in the conventional approach to promoting his art through galleries and art dealers because it should be easily available to all. Today he is viewed as one of the most influential impressionists of modern time.   Leonid Afremov was born in 1955 in Belarus. From an early age, he showed great interest and talent for art which his parents wholeheartedly supported. In 1973 after high school, he became a student at the arts and graphics department of Vitebsk Education Institute. Here he was highly influenced by the great masters like Picasso, Chagall, Dali, and Modigliani. Some of his early works were part of numerous exhibitions, and he even sold a few paintings. To make a living Afremov also designed sculptures for politicians, posters for schools, sets for various events, and sets for the local theater. The biggest obstacle for Afremov was his Jewish heritage, because of it, he could not freely promote his paintings through usual channels. Thus, he only managed to sell his artwork privately. Due to such an unfavorable climate, after the birth of his second son, the artist soon moved to Israel, where he worked in an advertisement agency. Here the galleries and the entire art community refused to accept his work due to his Russian heritage.   Leonid's breakthrough began when his teenage son successfully managed to sell a number of his paintings door to door. Thanks to the much-needed income, the artist was able to completely circumvent the system that did not approve of him by opening a gallery in 1995 in Ashdod. Unfortunately, it was often vandalized, and nobody would promote it. Due to this highly hostile environment, Leonid finally had enough and moved to America in 2001. Immediately the galleries in New York recognized the amazing beauty of his work and sold some of them for four-digit prices. Once Afremov discovered the possibilities of the internet and specifically eBay, his rise to stardom began in earnest.   Afremov’s paintings have unprecedented power to capture one's attention. Through the use of colors and techniques, his artwork makes an immediate emotional connection. Yet, they never possess any hidden meanings or messages, rather, everything is right there in the open. Afremov said: The main characteristic of his artwork, which is now part of numerous private collections around the world, is the simplicity that speaks for itself and invites us to take a stroll into the artist's inner world. In 2019, Afremov passed away in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.   ",1562

Martin Aagaard Hansen,"Born in Odense, Martin Aagaard Hansen is a Danish contemporary artist who began painting when he was 17 in the cellar of his old apartment. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Thomas Locher. The process differs for every painting, allowing the fluidity in his work. Hansen constantly shifts between abstraction based on pure intuition found in the process of painting and concrete inspirational sources either from memory or things he notices in his immediate surroundings. His work has been shown in several shows at Jacob Bjørn Gallery and Charlotte Fogh Gallery in Århus, Denmark, as well as at the art museums Viborg Kunsthal and Kunsthal Rønnebæksholm. Martin Aagaard Hansen lives and works in Copenhagen.",1608

Tatiana Levchenko,"Tatiana Levchenko is a Russian contemporary artist engaged in painting and graphics, working as a graphic designer. She studied at Saint Petersburg Stieglitz State Academy of Art and Design. Interested in different aspects, she appreciates drawing from life and, at the same time, she is fascinated by mythopoetic images. With an almost corporeal perception of the total connection between all physical bodies, energies, the artist has a sensation of the continuity of the vital matter. Basing her work on organic forms, projections of different objects, and random insights, Levchenko attempts to build a space of experiences, doubts, and subconscious reactions. For her, the creative process is a research rather than an aesthetic act. Searching for her way of reconstructing the spiritual body, the artist has been employing two creative methods for years – something she would, following Kandinsky, call “impressions” and “improvisation.”   Inspired by the texture and energy of the human body, its gracefulness, and the pulsation of a biological form, she works under the impression momentary emotions, fully trusting in gesture, in her mood, and her sense of color (impressions). The second method requires a psychological dive and the immersion in her intuition, letting the hand follow up the spontaneous and visualizing it (improvisation). Of course, applying these kinds of artistic approaches comes with a deep look into oneself and questions such as “Where is a genuine me? How much “white” and how much “black” are inside my consciousness? What is the dark side of my nature? How to distinct my true nature from a product of upbringing, of the traditions of my family, the society, the era?” Levchenko works on solving this problem primarily for herself, utilizing various techniques and materials. “Even working in the open air, I try finding out about the inner, hidden structure of the surrounding space…” Featured image: Tatiana Levchenko – portrait.

Ellina Zhanu,"Born in Nalchik, Russian Caucasus, Ellina Zhanu began painting at the age of 25 under the guidance of the local prominent artist. In 2016, she was chosen (from more than 100 applicants) by Mihail Chemiakin, the famous Russian nonconformist artist, to participate in his exhibition, held at the National Museum of Kabardino-Balkarian Republic. Two years later, on her 30th birthday, Ellina had her first solo exhibition. Titled “Ellinizm: restarted,” it was held at the Art Center in Nalchik. Quite unconventional and original, the opening consisted of famous bloggers, theater actors, artist’s friends, and the artist herself reading short stories written by Ellina. She also performed R’n’B, rock, and jazz pieces, accompanied by local musicians. The exhibition, supported by honored artists of the region and enriched by inspiring speeches and live music, was a success and a subject of great interest for the local community. In 2019, Zhanu was a special guest participant of the Roommates exhibition, an event organized to support young and promising artists of the region. For the show, she created illustrations for both the published collection of musical miniatures performed now in all Russian schools and the poetry collection to be presented soon by author in Russia and Europe. She was also named as the creator for a series of graphic illustrations in film credits of a local documentary director. Featured image: Ellina Zhanu – portrait. Photo courtesy Gallarty",1611

Fumero’s unique path of artistic exploration is titled Grafstract and it represents a harmonious interaction among line, shape and color.   ",1612
Janet Laurence,"Janet Laurence is a versatile Australian contemporary artist  working in photography, sculpture, video, and installation art. Exploring notions of art, science, imagination, memory, and loss, her work examines our physical, cultural and conflicting relationship to the natural world. Laurence is born in 1947 in Sydney, Australia, where she still lives and works. Laurence studied in Sydney and Italy, before living for New York City to pursue graduate studies. While living in New York, she was influenced by a Joseph Beuys exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum, and discovered the Earth or Land artists. She completed a Graduate Diploma in Professional Art Studies at the University of New South Wales and a Master of Fine Arts at the University of New South Wales.  Lawrence is best known for large, outside, immersive works, where she uses such natural materials as minerals and oxides, living plant matter, corals, taxidermy birds, and more. In the early 2000s her work became increasingly political as well as poetic, as she intentionally began to focus on the relationship between the artist, artwork and viewer. The viewers became a part of artwork as they were expected to engage with it, by, for example, looking through or walking through them.    ",1613
Malik Roberts,"Malik Roberts is an American painter and multimedia artist known for his deconstructed portraits that address controversial contemporary subjects, such as police brutality, exclusionary politics, and systemic racism. Exploring the relationship between today’s visual culture and reality, he often works with images and conventions recognizable from the media. Roberts manipulates these recognizable images to dismantle the viewer’s perception of reality. The process starts with breaking down a familiar-feeling icon or landscape into its most basic geometric forms. He then reconstructs the picture, layering charged source imagery and cartoonish extremities onto the geometric x-ray of his subjects. The artist portrays his subject’s internal and external conflicts with the kaleidoscopic effect, unlike the reductive rabble-rousing typical of Digital Age media.",1614
Zeehan Wazed,"Born in Benghazi, Libya, Zeehan Wazed is a contemporary artist whose work in painting, sculpture, choreography, and creative new media explores the relationship between physical and psychological reality today. He immigrated to the US in 1994 and was raised in Jamaica, Queens. Taking the subway to Stuyvesant high-school each day, he quickly discovered the flourishing subterranean universe of graffiti and street performance, becoming a champion dancer, prolific graffiti artist, and delinquent-darling before his graduation. Wazed went on to study Perceptual Psychology at Baruch College. However, when his graffiti career became a threat to his immigration status, he turned to the canvas. His works, infused by the artist’s past, passion for psychology, and freestyle dance, spark the viewers’ imagination with an image, design, or movement, at first appearing random and abstract. The audience begins to discern familiarities within seconds of interacting with the paintings due to Wazed’s coded approach that activates the mind’s natural tendency to seek out patterns and personal connections everywhere we look. He is currently experimenting with Augmented Reality on his paintings and plans to add AR to some of his other works, such as murals.",1615
David Dawson,"Born in Montreal, David Dawson is a Canadian photographer whose works are a reflection of his passion for nature and adventure, always striving to find an emotional truth in the work. He has worked as a photographer for more than two decades, traveling the world and capturing projects of varying commercial, documentary, and fine-art subjects. Dawson’s new projects with mixed mediums incorporate his experimentation with texture and iconic classic photographic styles.   ",1616
Paul Garbett,"Paul Garbett is a Canadian contemporary artist known for his landscape and animal-themed works, who is currently painting in encaustic or hot wax painting. This art form, which is centuries old, provides unique textural qualities and challenging complexity. “Inspired by nature and captivated by human nature”, Garbett creates paintings that call the viewers’ attention to the works of art that are all around us. An honors graduate of Ontario College of Art and Design, he has so far worked as a designer, illustrator, sculptor, and painter. Paul Garbett believes “that art is a form of therapy and can provide insight if not solutions to many of life's problems.” This belief is what fuels his ideas and explorations on his journey as an artist.   ",1617
Ben Hecht,"Ben Hecht is an American artist whose work is focused on mixed media encaustic (beeswax) combined with his original landscape photography of nature, primarily aerial views of the ocean. He often uses drones to achieve a unique perspective on his subject, along with an unexpected combination of materials such as beeswax and UV resin, which results in works that are immediate and recognizable yet foreign and mysterious. Ben Hecht is based in Southern California, and his work has been shown publicly since 1994.   ",1618
Fernando Costa,"Fernando Costa, also known simply as Costa, is a French artist widely known and recognized for his sculptures made exclusively out of road signs. Self-taught, he inhabits this unexplored universe, cutting and welding the obsolete and recycled road signs, creating colorful compositions. His welded panels usually tell stories with humor and occupy the crossing of several artistic movements, such as Street Art, New Realism, and Pop Art.  Sometimes figurative, sometimes abstract, Costa’s works always challenge the viewer through their construction and through the place that he chooses to give to each color. Born in Sarlat, he lives and works in Périgord, close to his birthplace.   ",1619
Pierre-Francois Grimaldi,"Pierre-François Grimaldi is a French contemporary artist best known for his collages made of vintage advertising posters from the 1930s to the 1970s. An urban archaeologist and collector of lost memories, he unearths these posters from the time during the renovations of the Paris Metro. The viewer can discern the history of these exposed and weakened papers, whether by their subject (political, advertising, and informative) or by their graphic, typographic content, and the palette of colors used. Though made from figurative posters, the final version of collages is very abstract. Through his choice of material and the technique he applies, Grimaldi has created a unique visual language populated with compositions that are dictated by his sensitivity, showing the evolution of our society and the ever-present excessive consumption.   ",1620
Francisco Brennand,"Francisco Brennand was a famous Brazilian painter and sculptor, best known for his work in ceramics. He was educated in Paris, where he, after discovering the ceramic work of Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and Fernand Léger, decided to become a ceramic artist.   ",1621
Etienne Viard,"Etienne Viard is a French contemporary sculptor whose work is rooted in minimalism and reduced aesthetically to one simple element – the line. His line is fragmented, pulled long, rounded, laid down flat or stood up straight, delicately fighting gravity in a fragile equilibrium. The artist, inspired by the undulating forms of plants and minerals, renders this organic movement in his sculptures, creating a perpetual and precarious energetic tension. Often called a “Steel Sculptor”, Viard uses Corten steel, highlighting the symbiosis that occurs between the artwork and its environment through the superficial rust. He places the raw material in a way that aims at the principle of conservation of mass, something which generally applies to three-dimensional art. Whether displayed outdoors or indoors, Viard’s works present a range of contradictory gestures, such as protruding shapes or chinks, which are monumental signs redefining the space around them and creating a dialogue between the sculpture and its environment. This dialogue is enriched through the introduction of the zenithal light in situ, consequently reinterpreting the variations of a répertoire today considered as classic. Etienne Viard lives and works in Paris and the Vaucluse (South of France).   ",1622
Kim ByungJoo,"Kim ByungJoo, also sometimes written as Kim Byung Joo or Kim Byung-Joo, is a Korean contemporary artist whose work is defined as an ellipse between the art of drawing and sculpture.",1623
Jan Astner,"Jan Astner is a Polish contemporary artist working in various fields, including painting, drawing, computer graphics, and photography. The basis of his paintings is acrylic paint, chosen because of its elasticity, delicacy, and durability. By combining different materials and techniques with acrylic paints, he gets unexpected visual results since unique colors emphasize the metaphysical nature of the work. Astner's paintings combine reflection on a man concerning the world around him in the age of post-humanism and trans-humanism. He works in series. Through process painting, as well as his personally developed acrylic-based techniques, he chooses the means of expression to present the issues bothering him. The artist studied architecture and fine arts in Poland and the USA. Jan Astner lives and works in Izabelin, Poland and Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.",1624
Ivo Alvarone,"Ivo Alvarone is an Italian abstract landscape painter, colorist, and poet, creating mostly acrylic and mixed media watercolors and drawings in small format. At first, he studied Art History but gave up after a year feeling too confined, deciding instead to travel extensively through Europe, sketching landscape, painting watercolors. He resumed his studies, this time with a focus on painting. Alvarone’s preferred subject is nature, while his creative process is driven by personal experiences and altered states of consciousness. The artist takes his viewers into his world of nature, using a unique technique that consists of a subtle and slowly deepening mixture of overlapping forms that convey his sensitivity. He works in series by discovering and applying new pictorial techniques and going beyond conventions. A very private individual, Ivo Alvarone lives and works in a small studio, trying to stay away from crowded exhibitions. Instead, he prefers a smaller audience that is willing to follow his works and experiments with true interest.",1625
Robert Lardus,"Robert Lardus is an American contemporary artist working exclusively in abstract painting, trying to capture what arises in his mind: thoughts, memories, dreams, and fears. Born in the deep Midwest of the United States of America, he studied painting and then went on a long journey through Asia. Fascinated by the process painting, he has invented numerous painting techniques. Without imposing his vision and without speaking directly, Lardus creates surprising, changeable, and changing interpretations. These are the core of his artistic approach, which leaves judging, evaluating, and analyzing to the viewers, who eventually give meaning to works. In his latest series, Humanography, Lardus refers to the art of calligraffiti. While not strictly using typical calligraphy, typography, and graffiti, he creates new symbols based on simplified drawings of the conventional figure of a human being.",1626
Vidal Toreyo,"Vidal Toreyo is an Argentinean contemporary artist whose painting style could be described as Post-Painterly Abstraction. Born in the Chubut region, the rough, coarse nature of his surroundings inspired him to pursue studying painting. He embraced abstract expressionism, an art form not limited by any particular compositional rigor. Toreyo creates colorful patches, lines, and patterns, letting the drama dominate his work by using color as a strong element. Over the next fifteen years, his work has evolved in a continuous process from expressionist representations strongly dependent on primitive art to new aesthetics of creating images. Currently, he is focused on alternating, mixing traditional and modern techniques by combining action images with a bold calligraphic style. He stays away from rhythmic and smooth, and his paintings contain many interacting layers, resulting in a surprising visual experience. Vidal Toreyo spends most of the year in Lima, where he studied, but occasionally goes back to the Andes to see his siblings and to enjoy the view of the mountains.",1627
Bartos Saro,"Preferring to work in mixed media, Bartos Saro is a Hungarian contemporary artist whose work focuses on the structure of materials. An art historian and sculptor by profession, he studied in his homeland and the UK. Having started his career in the field of modern design, he reached the level of a partner in a furniture showroom company where he could put to work his methodically working but open mind. However, the corporational restraints and pressure accumulated, and he left the industry. Inspired by landscape and nature, Saro is also inspired by forms and colors, despite his work being very abstract. Believing that there is a spirit in matter and that shapes and forms can reflect basic experiences attached to emotions, he enjoys creating tension and drama. The artist also uses sand in his paintings to emphasize the relationship between his art and nature. Bartos Saro used to have a studio in London but has moved to a quieter place near Bristol.",1628
Calman Shemi,"Calman Shemi is an Argentinian/Israeli contemporary artist widely known and recognized for sculptures, which dominated his earlier career, and paintings.

Dores Sacquegna,"Born in Lecce, Dores Sacquegna is a contemporary Italian curator and multimedia artist, working in several fields, including printmaking, photography, installations, design, and artist's books. Her work challenges reality and enters the magic of an imaginative elsewhere, where vision and narration become part of an indivisible process. The recurring themes of her art are the poetic, coexisting opposites, objects of collective memory, the real and the unreal, and the 360-degree visual space. Sacquegna earned a Doctorate at the Academy of Fine Arts in Lecce and has studied printmaking in Rome, Luxembourg, and Prague. Besides creating art, she is also a renowned curator who has curated numerous exhibitions, festivals, events, and seminars, both in Italy and abroad.   ",1631
Izvor Pende,"Izvor Pende is a Croatian contemporary artist whose painting style changed from figurative expression to his individual fictitious subject abstraction. Upon realizing something was missing from figuration, he decided to make a radical change, continuing his career in a completely new direction. However, the transition was not as smooth as he would have wanted. In the first year, he created a small series of works in which the figuration was still visible. The artist understood he needed to change everything in his working process and detach himself from his sphere of safety. Over the next several years, Pende’s style evolved from abstract images and spatial compositions to “recent images in which the repetition of certain forms are transferred to other works which result in a specific fictional construction.” The artist began studying sculpture in 1996 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb before moving to Germany to study painting at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, receiving his degree in 2002 under Professors Karin Rissa and Markus Lupertz and his master’s degree in 2005. Izvor Pende lives and works in Dubrovnik.",1632

Derrick Velasquez,"Derrick Velasquez is an American artist best known for large-scale sculptures and installations but also works in photography, collage, and other media. His work is “an attempt to construct a language of structure that questions our physical and psychological interactions with industrially manufactured materials that exist in the spaces (both large and small) we inhabit.” Using an investigative process, he projects varying forces like gravity or tension on Masonite, plywood, two-by-fours, hardwoods, marine vinyl, acrylic, and the human body, hoping to tease out both their obvious and less apparent qualities. The artist received his BA from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his MFA from Ohio State University. Born in Lodi, California, Derrick Velasquez currently lives and works in Denver, Colorado.",1634
Filipe Branquinho,"Filipe Branquinho is an artist from Mozambique who fuses genres such as portrait and landscape, proposing a reflection on social issues related to the contemporary reality of his homeland, its mythology, folkways, and urban dynamics. Multi-talented, he studied architecture, following with a career in both illustration and photography. Brought up in an environment closely connected to Maputo’s journalistic and artistic spheres, Branquinho’s aesthetic combines familiarity with the architecture and the “school” of Mozambican photography. Currently, the artist is working on a series entitled “Lipiko,” where he uses Mapiko masks from the Maconde tradition and then associates drawing and photography with a strong sense of satire to propose a reflection on aspects and values of contemporary national affairs. His works have been exhibited in South Africa, Brazil, Portugal, and Mozambique, and he was one of the selected artists to represent Mozambique at the 2019 La Biennale di Venezia.

Anastasia Buoy,"Anastasia Buoy is a Russian contemporary mixed media artist who paints in the style of Abstract Expressionism. Previously a scientist (Ph.D. in molecular biology), she embarked on a new path in 2018, becoming an artist. Somewhat similar to her field of scientific research, biomedicine, Buoy explores human-nature interaction, but from a perspective of emotional, even mystical experience. Though a self-taught painter, she has intensively studied art history and is currently enrolled at The School of Contemporary Art Free Workshops (at MMOMA). Known for her process-oriented approach, Anastasia’s every piece “represents a major reflection on a specific theme; it doesn’t hide or mask anything. The creation process is transparent: whether it was long and complicated, or easy and neat; thoughtful and meditative or expressive and bold.” The style of abstract expressionism symbolizes “deep, subconscious perception of the world with structured geometric lines that represent a reversion to rational thinking.” Anastasia Buoy lives and works in Moscow.",1636
Daria Onatskaya,"Daria Onatskaya is a Russian contemporary artist who focuses on simple things, capturing the beauty of the moment, the joy of life and the love of the place where she lives. The themes of her series range from cityscapes and still lifes to large exhibitions dedicated to her family, where she reflects on her childhood memories, impressions about various family members, and the inevitable sadness present when some of them are gone. Aside from pure artistic creation, Onatskaya is heavily involved in education. She runs a private art school (currently employing sex art teachers), where she guides hundreds of students each year in finding their way into the beautiful world of art.",1637
Jenya Pestova,"Jenya Pestova, also known as Evgenia Pestova, is a Russian contemporary artist who creates both figurative and abstract works, tapping into concepts of self-reflection and natural beauty through the use of multi-layered textures, colors, and organic and familiar shapes. Her calligraphy works, botanical illustrations, and her background in graphic design all heavily influence her process. She studied at the Moscow Institute of Art and Industry, working as a designer and illustrator. However, a few years after she moved to Berlin, Jenya decided to pursue an art career. Having freed herself from conservatism and the expectations of tradition, she uses her artistic life to discover what she wants to create, how she wants to paint it, and to inspire other women artists on that difficult journey. Born in Moscow, Jenya Pestova lives and works in Berlin.",1638
Irene Davydova,"Irene Davydova is an abstract painter based in Southern Germany whose paintings are about inner peace, silence, and immersion. Feeling lucky to be living so close to the Alps, she finds inspiration in various things. The mighty mountains and their texture, endless alpine meadows where the horizon is lost in the fog, icy ghostly rivers and lakes, and the contrast of dark moody skies and trees against the glow of ethereal lights all heavily influence her work. By diving deep into thoughts, memories, and pondering, the artist tries to translate these into her creations. Usually working with acrylic paints, she’s been known to take on other mediums as well, including ink, pastel, ballpoint pen, and more. Irene Davydova lives and works in Fuerth, Bavaria, Germany.",1639

Augusto Esquivel,"Augusto Esquivel is an Argentinian contemporary artist widely known and recognized for his sculptures made with Sewing and Shank Buttons. Mentally challenging and physically rigorous, his work invites the viewers to take a glance into a non-linear experience of pixelation and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Seeking to understand the dual identity experienced as an immigrant and the relationship with capitalism, the artist chose sewing buttons as a “tribute to the strong connection I had with my grandmother and the concept of up-cycling the material.” The technique he developed and employs in creating the pieces consists of “threading thousands of buttons using clear monofilament suspended from acrylic structures.” Augusto Esquivel lives and works in Miami.",1644
Gemmy Woud-Binnendijk,"Gemmy Woud-Binnendijk is a Dutch contemporary artist widely known for photographs that resemble 17th-century still lives and portraits. Originally a painter, working with liquid pigments and a brush, her path took her away from the canvas. Trying to claim space for her creativity, she picked up a camera and started experimenting, finding in photography a way to paint again. By manipulating the pixels and light, Woud-Binnendijk creates work that exists somewhere in between painting and photography. She discovered her visual aesthetics in the painting style of the 17th century and its lighting conditions – an image full of shadow, light, and a stillness in-between. For her, beauty is “to create an image where all the elements melt and then come together solidly.” Guided by her obsession to create and intuition, Woud-Binnendijk uses lines, light, color, and the contrast between them to tell a story. Depicting real things not entirely grounded in reality, she has genuinely transcended the border between disciplines and mediums, finding herself in a beautiful place between reality and fantasy, bringing together the painters of the past and artists of today.",1645
Tatyana Kondratenko,"Tatyana Kondratenko, also known as Tania Kandracienka, is a Belarus artist whose canvases are filled with volume and light; her bold experiments with space reveal its metaphoric value, its drama and dynamics. The objects in her paintings, at times nearly photorealistic, are juxtaposed to the rough abstract background. By adding contrasting details, the artist emphasizes the visible process of internal struggle and the sensation of spaciousness in the image. While Kondratenko wasn't focused on social and socio-political issues at the beginning of her career, today, her work reflects the reality of life in contemporary Belarus - the stagnation, the possibility of long-awaited freedom, and the position of a person within these dilemmas. Her series ""The Sum Of All Things"" reveals random piles of old clothes, abandoned and forgotten, bringing up the sensation of loneliness and isolation. Another series that dwells upon the state of humanity and its relationship to the objects that surround us is called ""The Gifts."" She studied at Minsk State Art College, named after A. Glebov, and at the Belarusian State Academy of Arts. Besides her artistic practice, Tatyana Kondratenko is a Ph.D. professor in Classical Drawing Art at Minsk Art Academy. She currently lives and works in Minsk.",1646
Giovanni Trimani,"Giovanni Trimani is an Italian artist whose vibrant color scheme enhances a stylistic choice characterized by an original pictorial language. At first glance, his work seems to take on playful and disengaged tones. However, upon a closer inspection, it appears permeated with existential meanings and capable of fully expressing human discomforts and emotions. Having reached a mature phase of his artistic research, Trimani is known for having two recurring iconographic elements: the chair, understood as a projection of the Ego, and the silhouette of a man “the Chair / Man” which is instead the path of the Ego. The theme of the chair is fundamental for the artist. Though seeming like a relatively simple everyday topic, it conveys important artistic and biographical contents on a symbolic level.",1647
Caltanino,"Nino Caltabiano, better known as Caltanino, is an Italian contemporary artist whose current work has left reality and became utterly abstract. He began drawing at a young age. However, after failing to attend art school, Caltanino continued his artistic path self-taught, participating in first group exhibitions and receiving a decent response from the audience. As he approached the mid-20s, his technical limits led him to a creative block, and he stopped painting.   After a decade of complete inactivity, he met an old friend who taught at a private art school ""L'Altrarte."" Caltanino decided to paint once again and started his art studies from basics. Four years later, he earned his Bachelor of Arts and began participating in group shows with some figurative works. Somewhere along the way, he left figuration behind and now focuses solely on abstraction. Caltanino lives and works in Rome.",1648

Khalid Alkaaby,"Khalid Alkaaby is an Iraqi artist based in the United States whose works are inspired by the love, grace, and beauty that surrounds him. Since early childhood, his natural talent for painting and drawing guided him towards a creative journey. Indeed, it was a beautiful one until it got uprooted in 2005, when Baghdad underwent massive terrorist bombings, forcing Alkaaby to leave his family, friends, and studio gallery. Having decided to embark on a journey of a lifetime, he immigrated to the United States, settling in San Diego. There he experienced a sense of creative freedom that allowed his works to reach higher levels. The free-flowing female figures, representing his figurative side, possess sheer mesmerizing beauty, from dynamic realism to seductive impressionistic encore. Alkaaby’s abstract works capture a moment in time along with the artist’s personal energy, fusing the two onto the canvas.",1651

Stanimir Genov,"Stanimir Genov is a Bulgarian artist whose work revolves around personal experiences. Focusing on small fragments of those experiences and placing himself in a working atmosphere built around that sheer focus, he aims to re-experience them through the painting process rather than describing them. This approach interrupts the logical path of the artist’s thinking, allowing him to enter into unknown and surprising territories. From 2007–2012, he was he is primarily interested in installation, video and sound, returning in 2012 to painting as his main medium. Genov received his BA (2006) and MA (2018), both in Painting, from the National Academy of Arts, Sofia.     ",1655

Mark Sheinkman,"Exploring notions of time, space, and transition, Mark Sheinkman is an American contemporary artist widely known for his linear abstractions. For years, he created monochromatic, black and white compositions, which suggest volume, movement, and growth. The artist builds up his canvases and drawings in layers, working into graphite to create a visual effect of curvilinear forms moving through space. In his earlier paintings and works on paper, there was often less distinction between figure and background and more of a compositional structure. Starting in the mid-2000s, Sheinkman transitioned towards making a more clear distinction between figure and background and away from all-over composition. Besides his continuous exploration of spatial relationships, the artist has been experimenting with color. The early experiments began in 2000, but he decided not to exhibit these works for almost two decades. Sheinkman studied at Princeton University, completing his B.A. summa cum laude in art history and studio art in 1985. He lives and works in New York.",1664
Joni Sternbach,"Joni Sternbach is an American artist, photographer, and filmmaker who explores various themes, such as domesticity and the family, and sexuality and the body. In her early work in the 1980s-1990s, the issues of gender, identity, and feminism were the most critical themes. The female figure, including her own, was a central motif. In her current work, Sternbach creates portraits of surfers and surfboards, experimenting with a variety of historical photographic processes. These wet plate collodion tintypes are captured in Australia, England, France, and both coasts of the United States. Dating back to the 1850s, a tintype is a wet plate process that includes a plate of iron coated with dark bitumen, sensitized with a silver salt solution and exposed in a large-format camera. It’s a nearly instant photograph, one-of-a-kind - in effect, a Polaroid. Sternbach received her BFA in Photography from the School of Visual Arts and a MA from New York University and International Center of Photography, where she taught for over a decade. She lives and works in New York City.",1665
Hugo Alonso,"Though best known in the art world for his pictorial work, Hugo Alonso has simultaneously developed a prolific and thorough line of work in the fields of video, film, and music - the latter under the alias of Lynda Blair. His acrylic paintings on paper, populated by women, naked or dressed in elegant clothes, draw upon these disciplines. Never showing their faces, Alonso depicts them with their back turned to the viewer, almost as an invitation to follow them. Desolated landscapes, both urban and rural, and silent interiors are other recurring subjects. Due to the artist's painting techniques, the more one gets closer to the paintings, the more these figures and places get blurred. Playing with cinematographic imagery, he allows the viewer to imagine multiple narrations around his subjects. His wide range of grey shades ""keep[s] images in a semantic and formal plane which is more aseptic and ambiguous. Each viewer creates a tailor-made 'set of circumstances' around each painting."" Born in Soria, Hugo Alonso is an award-winning artist whose works are included in numerous public and private collections.",1666

He started practicing graffiti in the mid-1980s and popularized painting trains while they were still in service. After earning his Master of Arts from the University of Arts, Crafts and Design (Konstfack), Nug began exhibiting his work. This attracted much attention as the artist used his (illegal) work to obtain a degree. Some strongly disagree with his spontaneous yet vandalistic approach, while others see his work as modern-day action painting and describe him as Pollock with a spray can. Not letting any of it get into his heat, Nug’s “ambition is to transfer my personal experiences of; and my own relationship to; graffiti, to new media and environments, without losing the energy of the traditional graffiti bombing.”   ",1674

Celia Wilkinson,"Celia Wilkinson is a British artist whose works were previously predominantly based on the landscape around Niton on the Isle of Wight, where she lived for many years. However, her recent paintings also reflect her travels to various countries. Painting from memory, she avoids immediate visual representations. This allows her to capture the essence of a time and place and give the viewer something to contemplate. Peter Lanyon, Paul Nash, Patrick Heron, Picasso, and Paul Klee are Wilkinson’s influences, as she feels they have broken traditions of landscape painting with their very individual styles. Interested in the process of deconstructing the landscape and piecing it back together, her paintings appear partly recognizable from a distance. Still, the closer one gets, the more it becomes about the painting process – color, marks, and textures. Wilkinson attended Central School of Art for her Foundation and went on to take her BA (Hons) Fine Art at St Martin’s School of Art, London. She lived in London until 2001, when she moved to the Isle of Wight. ",1688

Cheney had a pivotal experience in China during her three-month residency in 2015 when she began exploring the ideas and methods of collage in earnest. Her education began at Mount Holyoke College and continued at the Maryland Institute, College of Art, where she received her MFA in 1988. Born in Los Angeles, Galen Cheney traveled extensively.

Growing up between two cultures, Eckert has been particularly influenced by American imagery and pop cultural elements.

""We combine technology with tradition, cause at this point it would be a missed opportunity not to do it. But we don’t serve neither of them. We only serve the purpose of art, which is (the) freedom to express things that fail to be expressed otherwise."" Mauro discovered an interest towards digital art while studying architecture. Having realized that ""contemporary architecture allows little room for dreams,"" he shifted towards painting and sculpting and the liberation they brought. The turning point happened in London, where he has lived since 2010. He began attending performance art events and visiting artists’ studios, slowly entering the art world. ",1705

Futura,"The living legend of the graffiti movement, illustrator, photographer, sculptor, fashion and graphic designer from New York City, Futura - also known as Futura 2000 – is one of the major players on the current international urban art scene. The contemporary of SAMO, Keith Haring, Richard Hambleton, Cope2 and many other iconic NY writers, Futura helped define the graffiti movement of the early 1970s by moving it away from lettering and towards the more painterly, abstract style. This highly influential and multi-faceted artist has, to date, remained unique, fresh, and evolving, and his characteristic style has paved the way for a whole new generation of high-profile urban artists.   Futura is the pseudonym of Lenny McGurr born in 1955 in New York. Growing up on 103rd Street in Brooklyn during the boom years of train bombing, McGurr was introduced to graffiti in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s while he was traveling to school. Inspired by his favorite movie 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick and a book Future Shock written by the futurist Alvin Toffler, the young artist settled on the superhero pseudonym Futura 2000. He started to paint illegally on New York subway trains and city walls in the early seventies becoming widely known for his radically distinct approach to graffiti art. He introduced abstraction into a previously letter-based art form by covering whole cars of the city’s subway trains with his expressive paintings. Futura can be seen as the follower of some of the most prominent Abstract Expressionist ideas.   Growing up in the era of the civil rights movement, anti-war, and anti-draft protests had a great influence on Futura. In 1975, he joined the Navy and spent four years in Kenya, Pakistan, Australia, the Philippines, and all over Asia. When he came back to New York in the late 1970s, he realized that graffiti evolved and that street creatives were doing amazing artworks on the walls. Upon his return to the Big Apple, he met Keith Harring and Jean-Michel Basquiat and befriended with them. Futura emerged as the first artist who covered an entire wagon in abstract graffiti. Based on more graphic rules, in the beginning, his expressions developed into complex geometry, to achieve a more liberated form today, where a freer composition and colors are the base.     In the early 1980s, Futura began painting ""legally"" while he toured Europe with the punk band the Clash. He was painting banners for their stage show and taking an occasional cameo on the microphone. When the Clash went to New York in the 80’s they fell in love with the new culture of Hip-Hop that was emerging in lower-Manhattan’s art district and asked Futura to go on a tour with them and paint while they performed. The Clash’s song Overpowered by Funk from their fifth album Combat Rock features rapping vocals by Futura 2000. This collaboration didn’t end there, though. In 1983, Futura collaborated with Mike Jones of the Clash writing and singing the lyrics to The Escapades of Futura 2000, a track that articulated his artistic manifesto at the time, proclaiming: ""I guess I must admire—the need to set things on fire"". Futura has been active ever since, probing perceptions of public and private space, and blurring the line between street, commercial and fine art.  A signature figure throughout the artist’s oeuvre has been the Pointman, a robotic figure with an extended head, giving it the form of a Spaceship. Created in 1988, when Futura designed the cover art for the musical duo UNKLE’s debut album, Psyence Fiction, the Pointman has been one of the artist’s most recognizable motifs. With the success of the music album, came the success for the Pointman. Japanese toy manufacturer Medicom produced collectible toys. Bathing Ape, Nike and Levi’s were collaborators. The ventures gave Futura the opportunity to create his own brand: Futura Laboratories.   One of the founding fathers of street art, this widely recognized and multitalented artist is still very active. Highly respected by both his colleagues and art collectors, he has exhibited his works at such notable art spaces as the MoMA PS1 in New York, the Boymans Museum in Rotterdam, and the Gallery Du Jour in Paris. With a career that spans more than 45 years, he continues to create the cutting edge pieces which still seem fresh and influence young creatives throughout the globe.  The artist is represented by Magda Danysz in Paris, Magda Danysz in Shanghai, and Hang-Up Gallery in London. ",1722
Jean-Michel Basquiat,"Art has been used for far more than expressing the prowess of an individual in a given field: it often crossed bridges and set milestones in history for people divergent in many aspects. It allows those having different, even opposite points of view to be aware of the state of mind of the other by giving it a physical form, one perceivable and available for everyone to experience. Dealing mainly with the social issues of the late 20th century, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s work is both artistically alluring and bringing to the forefront many of the dualities of the time. Although he had an unfortunately short life and career, Basquiat has left an enormous impact on the world of art.  Jean-Michel Basquiat was one of those people that knew what they were going to do at a young age and didn’t give up on it. Roughed up more than once during his youth, the one thing constantly present in his everyday was art. The love for it was instilled by his mother Matilda, as she had taken him to the Manhattan museums regularly, as well as making him a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Having issues at home in his teens, Basquiat left the high school only one year before graduation, and he used art as a means of survival. He would sell shirts and postcards that portrayed his skills while making a living out of it, staying with friends in Brooklyn. During the late 1970s, his creativeness manifested in the form of graffiti, as he tagged the street walls and trains under the name of SAMO.   His financial struggle lasted for over three years, and during this time, he would paint the buildings of Lower Manhattan with graffiti bearing messages like ""SAMO as an escape clause"" or ""Plush safe he think.. SAMO"" (SAMO standing for “Same old shit”). He even appeared on the TV show “TV Party,” but the real breakthrough that he needed came in the form of a group exhibition in the early 1980s. With his work being noticed, he had joined the Annina Nosei gallery and utilized their space to work towards his first one-man show. Naturally, it was a huge hit - he often conjoined words, phrases, cryptic symbols and figures which engaged the viewers profoundly. The emergence of Basquiat in the art scene of the 1980s coincided with the appearance of Neo-expressionism which is characterized by rough handling of the material, and it couldn’t have served him better. Even though he had switched to painting at one point, he maintained his characteristic style of improvisation and “quick input.” His collaboration with Andy Warhol, both private and professional, aided Basquiat’s fame as much as it did Warhol’s work. They produced a number of “mutual” paintings, one finishing the work of the other, which brought them both positive and negative reviews over the years.   By the age of 27, Basquiat managed to produce over 1000 paintings and 2000 drawings! Yet, his pieces were never without purpose or a deeper meaning, whether he was talking about numerous social issues or wittily referencing various book content and knowledge through his work. Having an African-Caribbean heritage, he would often criticize the systems of colonialism and racism in his paintings, drawings, and poetics. He was also greatly influenced by the book Gray’s Anatomy that he read as a child, portraying anatomical elements in many of his pieces later on. One of such reoccurring elements is the foot, shown on multiple occasions even within the same artwork, depicting not just his studies of anatomy but all sorts of historical, even religious references through narratives. There was a certain duality that permeated his works on several levels. Dichotomies of a sort, he would merge text and image, historical elements with contemporary status; his narratives portrayed wealth versus poverty, often having mysterious and hidden meanings next to primitive elements. It all added to the genius of his practice, and though some parts may seem crude, Basquiat used them as tools for deeper truths of the individual.   Claiming worldwide critical acclaim in such short notice, even after not-so-envious beginnings, anyone would think that Basquiat will dominate the art scene in the years to come. However, there was one major weak point in his otherwise thriving career, one that would impede his creative output and influence his social behavior towards the end of his life. The death of his friend Andy Warhol was hard on Basquiat, and his already existing drug addiction and depression grew far more severe in the following period. The fame he obtained worked against him during the tough times of the mid-1980s, and friends described him as paranoid as he would segregate himself from any company for prolonged periods of time. His trip to Hawaii in 1987 was an attempt at sobriety, one that unfortunately did not bring results. Basquiat returned to New York in 1988 and died of heroin overdose at his gallery studio in NoHo neighborhood at the age of 27.   Even though his career and life ended far sooner than they should have, the American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat left behind an extensive oeuvre, one that is at the top of the list of monetary value today. However, the thought is divided of how truly valuable his works are, with some critics nudging towards it becoming repetitious. Others, on the other hand, see his presence and repertoire as a gift, as Basquiat had not just an eye, but a touch for artistic expression. The fact that he was a self-thought artist gives his works a whole new dimension, and regardless of how he is portrayed, he left an incredible influence on the course of art during his 27 years of life. The artist is represented by Vroom & Varossieau. ",1723
Fin DAC,"Fin DAC makes large murals of beautiful women, taking a new turn on 19-century art movement The Aesthetics. He believes, so did the Aesthetics, that art should not be political or social, it should only serve a purpose of bare embellishment of mundane lives. The purpose of art is to bring the beauty to the world. Being that the leading idea in street art is the social and political engagement, Fin DAC chose his theme to be a bit different. His murals depict beautiful women, with eye masks, who wear gorgeous clothes and elegant makeup. He named his style Urban Aesthetics, in which he combines the modern urban stencil art and traditional art of portrait.  The women he portrays are the real girls, who he met on various occasions. Their beauty is more than just the looks. He portrays them in ethnic clothing, with distinctive makeup and stylish jewelry, pointing out the significant appeal of variety. They come from different countries, with different styles, and everything that they represent plays a large role in Fin DAC's artistic journey. The one thing this artist never revealed is the origin and the meaning of the masks the women are always wearing. The masks are painted with color splashes, that usually complement the entire appearance. He paints caucasian, black and Asian women, stressing out the authentic appeal all these women have, fighting against the stereotypes and giving them the opportunity to display their personal characteristics without prejudiced assumptions.   Fin DAC, originally Finbarr Notte was born in Cork, but lives and works in London. He started making street art in 2008. DAC is an acronym for Dragon Armoury Creative. His combination of traditional portrait techniques and stencils crosses the boundaries of conventional street art. He uses stencils to make the outlines like a painter would use the photograph as an inspiration for canvas work. After he puts on the templates, he fills in the outlines by hand, using aerosol. This method gives his murals a blissful appearance and more dramatic shading. His sense of fashion is admirable. The women are dressed in stylish clothes, with statement pieces that signify their heritage and bring out their bold and fierce characters.   Glimpses of his charismatic personality and optimistic nature can be seen in his brilliant murals. Coming from the advertising world, he does not take for granted the freedom of the street art. What he does is the opposite of advertising. Instead of capturing the women into the stereotype and exploiting their desire to fit in, he gives them freedom to be themselves on the surfaces of many walls. This self-taught artist enjoys working with other creative minds such as Nick Walker, Jamie Reid, and Jef Aerosol. He painted walls all over Europe and even did a commissioned work for The Royal Albert Hall. He collaborated with some of the most popular brands, such as Armani, Red Bull, and Jagermeister. The artist is represented by Hang-Up Gallery, London, and Pretty Portal.  All images © Fin DAC",1724
Cleon Peterson,"The violence and hostility are rendered senseless in the works of American artist Cleon Peterson. Inspired by art history, specifically the classic Greco-Roman vases and their depictions of warriors and heroes in battles, the artist creates works that speak about the everlasting conflict between power and submission in today's society. About his work, Peterson said:   Cleon Peterson, born in 1973 in Seattle, expressed interest in art from a young age. His grandfather, an English professor, poet, and theologian, was responsible for most of his early education. At just fourteen years old, he left school and, on his own, obtained GED and entered the Graphic Design at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. After graduating with BFA, he earned his master's degree from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Detroit. About leaving school at a young age, Peterson said: After graduating, the artist moved to San Diego, where he worked as a skateboard graphic designer for several renowned businesses, including Zero Skateboards, Foundation Skateboards, and Pig Wheels, to name a few. In 1998 he was a part of artist Shepard Fairey's California street team.   In the early 2000s, Peterson began showcasing his work in group exhibitions. The artist is not concerned with who is the loser or a winner, for the system at its heart is broken. Thus in his artworks, the violence is often depicted without censorship, highlighting the authoritarian power. Influenced by Greek pottery designs and propaganda posters, he creates striking imagery packed with scenes of volatile conflicts.  He creates monochromatic works by choosing a simple color palette and limiting himself to white, black, yellow, and red. Often, the artist does not add background to his work, choosing instead to leave it bare. Thus the violence and aggression can not be put in any context that can explain or justify it, like in works entitled Eclipse (2017) and The Genocide (2016). In his life, Peterson is drawn to violence, for which he blames his natural disposition, which favors chaos and anger. These two volatile emotions are what gives fuel his creativity.   Cleon Peterson's work has been exhibited in numerous group and solo shows, including Mr. Sinister (2022) at Albertz Benda in New York, Truth & Lies (2021) at OTI Gallery in Los Angeles, and Exiles (2021) at Louis Buhl in Detroit. Throughout his career, he has exhibited in Paris, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and London. In 2023 is planning a solo show entitled Cleon Peterson at KaiKai KiKi in Tokyo and will participate in the group exhibition City Lights at Albertz Benda. Cleon Peterson lives and works in Los Angeles. ",1725
Andrew Schoultz,"Perfectly capable of working indoors as well as outdoors, Andrew Schoultz is an American artist known for his densely layered artworks exploring patterns in history related to war, natural disasters, and globalization. Exceptionally detailed, his work manifests various social, political, and economical crises. Lacking overt references to any singular historical event, his oeuvre rather explores a collective unrest, pulling from disparate global affairs and histories such as the 2016 U.S Election, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the rise of China as an economic giant, natural disasters, the pangs of the recession in the United States, to the fall of the Persian and Roman Empires. Although the artist’s themes are unequivocally universal, the work is instantly recognizable through Schoultz’s distinctive, illustrative style.  Drawing inspiration from graffiti, underground comics, the archaic illustrations of the Nuremberg Chronicle of 1492, German map-making, and Persian Miniatures to name a few, the artist’s work is profoundly chaotic both visually and thematically. Schoultz himself elaborated the themes of chaos and destruction that are dominating his practice: “Chaos and destruction are reoccurring themes in my work because I feel like these things are happening all around us constantly. Whether it is the multiple wars being fought all over the world, the natural disasters that seem to happen on a somewhat regular basis, the man-made environmental disasters that are becoming more and more prevalent, to the economic crisis that has been crushing this country’s poor and middle class for years. I feel like you really cannot talk about one of these things without talking about all of them, so it becomes a monster of a subject.”[1] He’s simply trying to depict what drives and motivates him, stating that his choice of themes does make him feel a bit self-defeated and admitting the desire for the existence of something else, thematically different but equally inspiring and motivating.    Schoultz has always been very interested in the idea of an open space, from painting murals in public and writing graffiti on walls, to utilizing public plazas for activities like skateboarding. The majority of his early works were outdoor-oriented, dwelling on a territory designated for graffiti, street art, and murals. As he admitted in an interview some almost a decade ago: “I also paint murals where ever I can, when I can.”[2] This approach hasn’t changed over years, it simply suffers from the lack of funding and appropriate walls. As for the most recent murals, Schoultz completed a project in Los Angeles' Chinatown district in collaboration with Converse for their Blank Canvas Program in January 2016, and just several months later, in May, he traveled to the Philippines, where he completed a new mural for the ArtBCG Mural Festival in Manila. At 92 feet by 100 feet, the enormous wall is Schoultz's largest public work to date. Most of his exhibitions feature large on-site installations, which often include sculptural components, thematically similar to the rest of the exhibited artworks.   Born in Milwaukee, WI, Andrew Schoultz roamed the US before settling in San Francisco in 1997. He received his BFA in Illustration from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, CA. Speaking of himself and his personal inspirations, the artist states: “There have been many real-life events and experiences that have affected my work. I would definitely say just living a certain type of lifestyle for so many years has really shaped the person I am and has made me into the artist that I am. I have always subscribed to a more DIY ethos in life and this has really benefited me greatly in my path as an artist.”[3] Having recognized a cyclical course of a human history, Andrew Schoultz creates frenetic imagery coated in a distinctive visual style – altogether earning him a place in our list Top Ten Bay Artists You Need To Know.

Sebastien Preschoux,"Sébastien Preschoux is a self-taught Parisian artist known for his handmade thread installations and geometric drawings. The main characteristic that differentiates his art among many contemporary aesthetical concepts is his insistence on manual labor. Drawing inspiration from the values of the Bauhaus movement that proclaims the fundamental importance of manual work, Preschoux tends to stay true to the notion and for in his opinion the only art that has sense is one that is handmade. An approach that is quite in a confrontation with contemporary culture in which technology prevails, is essential for his critique of arts and modern lifestyle.   Sébastien Preschoux was born in Paris in 1974. He firstly started working as a designer but very soon was completely bored with the conditions and limitations of the job and felt a need to create essential, necessary and vital art. Going back to a natural and spontaneous relationship with the materials, environment, time and work that is put into it, was a crucial first step to showing what is needed in real time in order to create something that the computer finishes in seconds. He praises the value and possibilities of human bodies as perfect tools for creating and enjoying art. He claims that we only need to invest all of our senses and use a little patience – and everybody could create what he does. Using the mantra man vs. machines he tends to highlight the barren falseness of the dominance of technology that frightens him in contemporary culture.  Sébastien’s work includes ink drawings he does only using Rotring and thread installations in the urban and natural environment. His intricate multicolored installations made of thousands of feet of strings look like spider webs in geometrical forms. A couple of years ago, he spontaneously started making this kind of string sculptures while working in the forests of Argentina. He liked the notion that the sculptures and installations are in the open, that they are positioned for discovering and are completely available for touching, observing and playing with. Since, they became his trademark. He says that he tends to adjust the installation to the environment, finding inspiration in the natural flow of light, space, and movements in nature and obtaining complete freedom in terms of size and variety. He usually works with Ludovic Le Couster who captures the photographs of the space they are working on. For both of them, the intention is to bring art closer to people in terms of experience and feelings.   Paintings of Sébastien Preschoux render geometric forms that repeat in patterns and create optical illusions. They are similar to the installations, as they tend to deconstruct the distinctions between work that looks like it could be made by a computer and without any use of it. In Sébastien’s words: With a computer, you can make everything fast-paced and very flattering, everyone can fake it, and so what’s the point? Nothing personal, nothing unique. It is so pleasant to have the surprise of the result, to feel that things can escape you and take an unexpected direction. The important thing is to have a tactile relationship with the material, to be able to dread the qualities and the defects.[1] The artist is represented by the David Bloch Gallery, Marrakesh.

Jaybo Monk,"French artist Jaybo Monk is known for creating work that perfectly blends figuration and abstraction. Featuring fractured human forms, the artist draws an emotional topography of his life, challenging the viewers to wake up to the image-saturated digital age we are immersed in. Jaybo began his career on the streets of Paris, and today in his work, the influence of graffiti is clearly visible. He admires the masters, such as Salvador Dalí and Amedeo Modigliani, and enjoys combining elements from their work with street art. Monk has exhibited regularly worldwide since 2005, including solo shows in Melbourne, New York, Los Angeles, Perth, Paris, London, and Berlin.   Born Jeremy Baudouin in 1968 in Paris, Jaybo ran away from home at the age of 14 and lived on the streets for several years. He came in touch with the street art scene and started working various jobs, including graffiti artist, actor, and street musician in the hip hop group Reality Brothers. In 1986 after relocating to Berlin, he founded the magazine Style and the Family Tunes and a streetwear label Irie Daily in 1994. In his works, such as Can I Escape Destiny (2010), Jaybo mixes different styles of composition, making it impossible to attribute one defining movement of the aesthetic genre. The artist is influenced by the works of Francis Bacon, which can be best seen in his Self Portrait (2009). Featuring distorted and fractured faces, the artist examines all the problems that we face in the age of mobile phones and selfies.   From time to time, Jaybo compositions are affected by the rough texture of the applied primer. His paintings possess great psychological depths, which the artist accomplishes through chaotic and erratic fragments and various materials. The motifs vary, as one can clearly see the influence of Asia, mixed in with Bacon's figuration and Walt Disney characters. The incorporation of these stylistic quotes, which Jaybo calls ""visual reflexes,"" specifically targets the viewers' high level of familiarity that drives them to create meaning behind the artwork. The finest example of this is his light projection on the Berlin Cathedral titled New Wave, which featured a tidal wave of Mickey Mouse's hands. For this reason, the artist is considered to be a vanguard of the Graffuturism movement.   Even though Jaybo Monk's artworks have roots and are inspired by street art, today, they are considered part of fine art. The artist's latest group shows were Never Mind The Burnout (2022) at the Haus am Lützowplatz in Berlin, A Major Minority Group Show: Graffuterism 10 Year Anniversary at the Mirus Gallery, San Francisco, and L'avenir. Graffuturism Group Exhibition at the Mirus Gallery, Denver. The artist is a member of Agents of Change, an art collective based in London. Jaybo Monk lives and works in Berlin. ",1729
Alex Senna,"Born in 1982 in Orlândia, Alex Senna is a Brazilian street artist who creates vivid expressions of human love, romance, and relationships through youthful black and white illustrations. Combining the languages of illustration, comics, and graffiti from the 1990’s, this artist builds a playful, almost poetic narrative, giving his works strong popular appeal. His murals, observing human relations loaded with emotional baggage and intertwined with satire, have in recent years been lending a cartoony look to the streets of São Paulo (and many others). Using symbols taken from the imagination of children – hearts, musical notes, balloons, birds - Alex adds „color“ to his art which is markedly colorless. Colorblind, Senna continuously used one color in his drawings and sketchbooks, which later reached the city walls, marking the urban setting with a simple and clear emotional visual flavor. By transposing his sketches to city walls around the globe he ignites urban settings with feelings of love and happiness by exposing his viewers to the intimate lives of his characters. The art's resonating black and white tones make his messages come across simple, clear, and straight from the heart.  His heroes and personalities are lovably charismatic - young couples dating, falling in and out of love; elderly people going about their days; melancholic girls and boys; everyday people in ordinary and extraordinary situations that we can all relate to; Alex Sena's characters establish a romantic dialogue with the viewer and represent dream notions of subjectivity, drama, and faith. As if parts of the same novel, fragmented into various media, but easily interpreted as ideological variations of the same character: the artist himself. The languid shapes of its protagonists seek balance with calculated doses of tragicomic mood. The moments of exposed weakness imagined by Senna contrast with the aggressive hardness of style expected by urban art. São Paulo, impregnated by cultural vanguards, contrasts with the bucolic essence of the home city of the artist: provincial Orlândia. And just like the contrast between the black and white, Alex Senna attempts to make contrasts and opposites meet in as much harmony as possible.   Self-taught, Senna has been drawing ever since he was a kid. Never having undergone formal education, comics served as textbooks in his learning process and his teachers were artists of the likes of Moebius, Quino, Charles Burns, David Clowes, Mauricio de Sousa, Walt Disney and Will Eisner. Forming his style as a mix of many different approaches and emotions, his favorite themes to explore on city walls are daily life, politics, melancholy, and love. He hopes to evoke a thinking process with his art, make people reflect and ponder on the possible meanings. All the small stories are interconnected, Senna says, and if one pays close attention, the threads that link them together come to light.  ",1730
Barbara Kruger,"American conceptual artist Barbara Kruger is best known for her layered photographs, featuring provocative statements on issues like commercial culture, feminism, and identity politics. Her work is based on black-and-white photographs with overlaid with bold, declarative text in red. She prevalently uses  Futura Bold Oblique and Helvetica Ultra Condensed fonts and her pieces often contain pronouns such as you, I, us, and we in order to make her statements more personal and dramatic. Barbara Kruger belongs to a circle of feminist postmodern artists, together with Jenny Holzer and Cindy Sherman.  Barbara Kruger was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1945 and left there in 1964 to attend Syracuse University. Early on she developed an interest in graphic design, poetry, writing and attended poetry readings. After studying for a year at Syracuse she moved to New York where she began attending Parsons School of Design in 1965. She studied with fellow photographer Diane Arbus, who introduced Kruger to other photographers and fashion magazine subcultures. After a year at Parsons, Kruger again left school and worked at Condé Nast Publications in 1966. Not long after, she started to work at Mademoiselle magazine as an entry-level designer, she was promoted to head designer a year later. Later on, she worked as a graphic designer, art director, and picture editor in the various art departments. Her solid background in design is evident in the conceptual and intellectually appealing work for which she is now internationally renowned.   Kruger’s earliest artworks date to 1969. Large woven wall hangings of yarn, beads, sequins, feathers, and ribbons, they exemplify the feminist recuperation of craft during this period. Despite her inclusion in the Whitney Biennial in 1973 and solo exhibitions at Artists Space and Fischbach Gallery, both in New York, the following two years, she was dissatisfied with her output and its detachment from her growing social and political concerns. In the fall of 1976, Kruger abandoned her ongoing projects and moved to Berkeley, California, where she taught at the University of California for four years and steeped herself in the writings of Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes. She took up photography in 1977, producing a series of black-and-white photo works of architectural exteriors paired with her own shorts writing. This work was published as an artist’s book in 1979, called Picture/Readings and it foreshadows the aesthetic vocabulary Kruger developed in her mature work. By 1979, Barbara Kruger stopped taking photographs and began to employ found images in her art, mostly from mid-century American print media sources, with words collaged directly over them. For example, her piece commonly known as Perfect portrays the torso of a woman, hands clasped in prayer, evoking the Virgin Mary. The word perfect is inserted along the lower edge of the image. These early collages in which Kruger used the techniques she had perfected as a graphic designer, were the artist’s initiation into the world of ongoing  political, social, and feminist provocations and commentaries on religion, sex, racial stereotypes, consumerism, corporate greed, and power.   During the early 1980s Barbara Kruger perfected a signature agitprop style, using cropped, large-scale, black-and-white photographic images juxtaposed ironic aphorisms, printed in Futura Bold typeface against black, white, or deep red text bars. The inclusion of personal pronouns in her works such as Your Gaze Hits the Side of My Face from 1981 or I Shop Therefore I Am from 1987 engage the viewers by confounding any clear notion of who is speaking. These rigorously composed mature works function successfully on any scale. Their wide distribution - under the artist’s supervision - in the form of umbrellas, bags, postcards, mugs, T-shirts, posters, and so on, confuses the boundaries between art and commerce and calls attention to the role of the advertising in public debate. Since the mid-1990s, Kruger began creating various large-scale immersive video - audio - text installations, which can completely envelop the viewer and his mind. In 1997, she has created a series of fiberglass sculptures of famous (and infamous) celebrities and during the same year in New York, she decorated the city with quotations from important public personas. For her first retrospective that was held at in Los Angeles, she painted 15 billboards with many insightful captions in both English and Spanish. Around the same time, for the public awareness campaign in Unified School District of Los Angeles, Kruger covered buses with bold sentences like Give your brain as much attention as you do your hair and you’ll be a thousand times better off or You want it. You buy it. You forget it. Kruger continues to question and advertise various issues of power, control and affection – in 2016, she used the nude image of the American ultra-popular celebrity Kim Kardashian as a background for her insightful new slogan - It’s all about me - I mean you - I mean me, which was published as the cover for W Magazine.   Kruger’s work powerfully examines individual participation within consumer and media culture and provides a forceful feminist critique. She has exhibited her work at the Museum of Modern Art and the International Center for Photography in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the National Center for Contemporary Art in Grenoble, France, and at the Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland, among other institutions. Her work has also been reproduced on billboards, t-shirts, and other public venues. In 2001, she won the prestigious MOCA Award for distinguished women in the arts. The artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art, Pop Fine Art and Robert Fontaine Gallery.  ",1731
Joseph Kosuth,"Replacing the visual display with words used to convey the relationship between ideas and the images, Joseph Kosuth was one of the beginners of Conceptual art during the 1960’s, advocating the theory that art should be deprived of any trace of skill and craft in order not to interfere ideas to be revealed directly, immediately, and purely as possible. Obsessed with the equivalences between the visual and linguistic and influenced by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein’s ideas of language, Kosuth strived to comprehend the relation between words and their meanings and their direct impact on the things they describe. His work has often incorporated for him interesting quotes from literature, philosophy, psychology, and history, offering to the audience a chance to contemplate issues of poverty, racism, loneliness, isolation, the meaning of life, and personal identity.  Kosuth was born in Toledo, Ohio in 1945, where he attended the Museum School of Design since he was ten. After one-year drawing and painting studies at the Cleveland Institute of Art, he traveled abroad, throughout Europe and North Africa, and finally settled in New York City in 1965, where he studied painting at the School of Visual Arts until 1967. Already questioning the utility of imagery in conveying meanings and ideas and exploring the use of language, Kosuth decided to study anthropology and philosophy at the New School for Social Research. At the age of only 20, he started to create complex works that would announce the Conceptual art and its comprehension of art as a pure idea and meaning. Assembling the objects, the photographs of those objects and an enlarged copy of the dictionary explanation of it, his One and Three series of installations (1965) have represented a direct exploration of his strivings. His first and at the same time the most famous example of his this series, One and Three Chairs, questions what actually constitutes a chair in our thinking – the object or the word? As a piece that highlight the relation between the language, picture, and referent, it confronts the viewer with the use of words for explaining or identification, exploring how language plays an integral role in the conveying meaning of things, becoming the verbal or written equivalent for the object. First Investigations, subtitled Art as Idea as Idea (1966-68), enlarged Photostats of dictionary definitions completely deprived of objects in order to focus on meaning conveyed through pure language, were inspired by Ad Reinhardt’s comment that “art is art as art and everything else is everything else”. Often compared to his reductive abstract paintings, Kosuth admitted that theories of his colleague painter were interesting to him, especially his ideas on the moral and social importance of art. Two artists showed nothing but mutual understanding and respect, Reinhardt even exhibited a copy of Julia R. de Forest’s Short History of Art to Kosuth’s 1967 exhibition Fifteen People Submit Their Favorite Book at Lannis gallery in New York. Besides Reinhardt, other prominent artists of the contemporary New York scene gave their contribution to this show, such as Sol LeWitt, Dan Graham, Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Carl Andre, and others[1]. The same year, Kosuth established the Museum of Normal Art, new city exhibition space.   By the 1970’s people started to collect his Photostats (quick photographic copies of text) as souvenirs, “objectifying and fetishizing” them, as the artist thought, so he decided to publish them as advertisements in magazines, aiming of further undermining their object-like value. Late 1960’s was marked with his installations consisted of words shaped of neon light tubes and applied on different surfaces in a form of simple statements, clear and self-evident. Kosuth’s early conceptual works have been met with acceptance, praised for their innovation, which led him to the teaching position at the School of Visual Arts in 1967. Two years later, he published his first edition of Art after Philosophy, three-part essay in which he processes the theme that visual art could be used for exploration of the meaning of language, asserting Marcel Duchamp as the crucial person for directing the Modern art from visual development to ideas embodied through common, non-artistic objects. As the American represent, Kosuth became a part of the Conceptual group Art & Language based in Great Britain until 1976, when he met with disagreement with the other members about some publications and his own popularity independently of the group. During his philosophy and anthropology studies, he found the writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly his 1921 Tractatus Logico-Philosopicus, very useful and applicable to his own work which would be exploit later in his experiments with words, explorations of nature of meaning, language cognition, and relation between language and art, as a permanent concern in his pieces. Throughout his career, Kosuth wrote and edited numerous publications which relied on his philosophy, often mentioning Duchamp’s readymades as a foundation of his thoughts. Asserting that works of conceptual art are linguistic in character, he emphasized the idea of their defining role, making them tautological[2]. In recent years, he received a number of commissions for numerous site-specific large-scale installations at Louvre, Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and the Norman Foster renovated building in Berlin.   The artist received his first award, a Cassandra Foundation Grant in 1968, at the age of only 23, as the choice of Marcel Duchamp, who died one week later. It was followed by the Brandeis Award in 1990, Frederick Weisman Award in 1991, the Menzione d'Onore at the Venice Biennale in 1993, and the Chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French government the same year. Other recognition he has received from the French Republic was a 3-franc post stamp in honor of his work in Figeac. In 2003, Kosuth was awarded the Austrian Republic's highest honour for accomplishments in science and culture and in May 2012 he was inducted into the Royal Belgian Academy[3]. Since his first teaching position in 1967 at the School of Visual Arts in New York, he has been visiting professor at numerous institutions, such as the Staatliche Akademie der Bildende Kunste in Stuttgart, Yale University, Pratt Institute, and Oxford University.

Brian Dettmer,"Brian Dettmer is a New York-based artist born in 1974 in Naperville, Illinois known for his detailed and innovative sculptures with books and other forms of antiquated media. In his work Brian begin with an existing book and seals its edges, creating an enclosed vessel full of unearthed potential. He cuts into the surface of the book and dissects through it from the front. He works with knives, tweezers and surgical tools to carve one page at a time, exposing each layer while cutting around ideas and images of interest. Nothing inside the books is relocated or implanted, only removed. Images and ideas are revealed to expose alternate histories and memories. His work is a collaboration with the existing material and its past creators and the completed pieces expose new relationships of the book’s internal elements exactly where they have been since their original conception. About his work Brian says: “The age of information in physical form is waning. As intangible routes thrive with quicker fluidity, material and history are being lost, slipping and eroding into the ether. Newer media swiftly flips forms, unrestricted by the weight of material and the responsibility of history. In the tangible world we are left with a frozen material but in the intangible world we may be left with nothing. History is lost as formats change from physical stability to digital distress. The richness and depth of the book is universally respected yet often undiscovered as the monopoly of the form and relevance of the information fades over time. The book’s intended function has decreased and the form remains linear in a non-linear world. By altering physical forms of information and shifting preconceived functions, new and unexpected roles emerge. This is the area I currently operate in. Through meticulous excavation or concise alteration I edit or dissect communicative objects or systems such as books, maps, tapes and other media. The medium’s role transforms.

Joseph Beuys,"The biggest figure of the post-World War II avant-garde scene in Germany, Joseph Beuys viewed art as an exceptional mean for invoking positive social changes. His performance art pieces were mystical experiences often described as shamanistic in nature because of Beuys' tendency to incorporate ritualized gestures and sounds. Additionally, Joseph Beuys also included some very repulsive materials within his works, such as human fat, blood and even dead animals. He was often branded as rather controversial by the public as many were not able to cope with the graphic aspects of this artist's work. Joseph also counted debate and teaching as vital parts of his art and was a leader in many social and economic reforms in his time. Akin to Andy Warhol in influence but with a more wildly ranging vocabulary, Beuys is possibly the most vital performance artist to have ever lived.   Joseph Beuys was born in Krefeld, a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was a son of a merchant Josef Jakob Beuys who moved his family from Geldern to Krefeld in 1910. After 1921, the year of Beuys' birth, Josef yet again decided to move. This time, the family set its sails for Kleve, an industrial town in the Lower Rhine region of Germany which is very close to the Dutch border. It was here that Joseph spent his childhood, studying at the Katholische Volksschule primary school and Staatliches Gymnasium Cleve secondary school. During his school days, Beuys showed an exceptional talent for drawing. Additionally, his creativity was further stimulated with regular piano and cello lessons. It's recorded that young Joseph also visited the studio of the Flemish painter and sculptor Achilles Moortgat on at least few occasions. Beuys enjoyed reading as well, making books his primary choice of entertainment. Interestingly, when the Nazi Party staged one of their notorious book-burning incidents in Kleve on 19 May 1933 in the courtyard of his school, young Joseph saved the book Systema Naturae by Carl Linnaeus from the flames. After Adolf's government made the Hitler Youth membership mandatory, Beuys joined thousands of German children and adolescents at the time and became a part of this notorious group when he was fifteen years of age. Joseph was even a part of the controversial Nuremberg rally in September 1936. As he was coming near to the end of his teens, Beuys wanted to be a doctor. However, after he was influenced by pictures of Wilhelm Lehmbruck's sculptures, Joseph decided to become a sculptor himself.   When the World War II began, Joseph Beuys began his military training as an aircraft radio operator under the tutelage of the famous Heinz Sielmann. Additionally, the young artist also attended lectures in Biology and Zoology at the University of Posen. From 1942, Beuys was stationed in the Crimea and was a member of various combat bomber units. As the Germany was being brought to its knees and the tide of war was turning, Joseph was deployed as a rear-gunner in the Ju 87 Stuka dive-bomber. It is rather logical that all the violence of WWII finally pushed Beuys' eternal doubtings overboard and enabled him to pursue the career of an artist. Some of his drawings and sketches from this period were salvaged and it's interesting that they were already displaying Beuys' characteristic style. As the story goes, the pivotal moment of his career happened on the 16th of March in 1944. After an intense battle in the sky, Beuys's plane crashed on the Crimean Front. Allegedly, he was rescued from the crash by nomadic Tatar tribesmen who had wrapped his severely injured body in animal fat, nursing Joseph back to health. Concerning this turn of story, the artist spoke on numerous occasions, often stating that he would not be alive had it not been for the Tartars[1]. However, German war records show that Beuys was actually delirious when the Nazi search commando unit found him and that there were no Tatars in the vicinity at that particular time. Nonetheless, such a fascinating tale appealed to the public which accepted it as the true origins of Joseph's artistic identity. Following the plane incident, Beuys was rotated back into the army and served bravely until the end of the war as a part of a paratrooper unit. After the piece treaty was signed, he returned to his parents who had moved to a suburb of Kleve.   After his return to post-war Kleve, Beuys met the local sculptor Walter Brüx and painter Hanns Lamers. The two new friends introduced joseph to the local scene and enabled his entrance into the Kleve Artists Association. In 1946, the ambitious artist enrolled in the sculpture program at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts. The anthroposophic philosophy which was a big part of this university's core identity effectively became a key aspect of Joseph's own art as well. He explained such a decision with the following statement: an approach that refers to reality in a direct and practical way, and that by comparison, all forms of epistemological discourse remain without direct relevance to current trends and movements. In 1947, Beuys was a founder member of the group Donnerstag-Gesellschaf (Thursday Group). He was in charge of organizing group's discussions, exhibitions and concerts[2]. As a hobby, Joseph also assisted with a number of wildlife documentaries made in the late 1950s. Beuys graduated from the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts in the year of 1953. He was thirty-two years of age at the time. After that, Joseph had a modest income from a number of crafts-oriented commissions as he proved himself to be a rather talented maker of furniture and gravestones. However, Beuys' main goal was making art. He mostly created drawings and sculptures through which he was able to examine a range of unconventional materials and improve his artistic program by investigating metaphorical and symbolic connections between natural wonders and philosophical systems. Joseph basically desired to explore the material world through the sphere of myth and philosophy. Unfortunately, such individualistic concepts led Beuys to regular physical and psychological crises, eventually exploding in a form of a severe depression in 1956. On the brighter side, Joseph's ideas were considered to be critical concepts of the Fluxus movement and it's anti-art propaganda.   In 1961, Beuys was appointed as a professor of monumental sculpture at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. This enabled him to do what he loved the most - holding lectures, philosophizing and teaching others. Joseph's first genuine performance piece, or Aktion as he preferred to call them[3], was held at the Technical College of Aachen in 1964. The artist performed an act which he titled Lebenslauf/Werklauf (Life Course/Work Course) but was not able to finish it as Beuys was attacked by the students during the show. This controversy was further emphasized as Joseph was fired from the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf for tutoring sixteen individuals which were saw as not fit for the school's program. Nonetheless, Beuys continued an intense schedule of public lectures and discussions, as well as becoming increasingly active in German politics as his reputation was starting to grow in the eye of the public. Finding so much pleasure in teaching, Joseph Beuys said that teaching is the greatest work of art and that the rest is the waste product, a mere demonstration. He desired to channel teachings through his artworks, to somehow make his pieces extremely socially and politically aware. He wanted to give his art a role, he felt it needed a duty. In order to achieve such challenging goals, Beuys turned to shamanism. Although such a decision was not a novelty in art history (Picasso and Gauguin come to mind in an instant), Joseph was unusual as he felt that it was necessary to integrate the shaman role into both his art and private life. Joseph's most praised performance pieces such as How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare and I Like America and America Likes Me were heavily based on such concepts. In his own words, Beuys saw and used his performative art as shamanistic and psychoanalytic techniques to both educate and heal the general public. When observed from that perspective, Joseph's art was educative as well as therapeutic[4]. Although his performances were the highlight of his career, Beuys organized less and less such acts as he was growing older. This may be explained as a necessity of aging and losing energy, but such a lower number of performances was required in order for Joseph to hold as many lectures as he felt was humanly possible - something he did until the end of his life. Joseph Beuys died of heart failure on 23 January 1986, in Düsseldorf, after a long period of illness that plagued him for years.   Between his intellectual lectures and controversial performance pieces, Joseph Beuys effectively reserved his spot in the elite of art history. Ultimately, his life's mission was to make creativity more democratic and socially aware, all in order to collapse the space between life and art - we are proud to say that Beuys managed to achieve his objective with flying colors, to say the least. One can make a rather bold and justified statement that both Conceptual and Performance art would not be the same today[5] if this German artist was not active for some unfortunate reason. Luckily, Joseph Beuys left his imprint on both mediums, dictated the courses they took and shaped them in what they fundamentally still are today.

Mike Kelley,"Michael Mike Kelley was one of the most influential figures in American contemporary art. During his 35 years long career Mike Kelley worked with almost every medium imaginable from drawings on paper, sculpture, performance, music, video, photography, and painting. The versatile artist also produced a number of collaborative works as a result of projects made with artists Paul McCarthy, Tony Oursler and John Miller.1 His interests were as diverse as the mediums he used and included sexuality, repressed memory, religion and spirituality, the class system and post-punk politics. By using an array of the non-artistic object such as blankets and toys in his art Mike Kelley continuously blurred the line between high and low culture.  Mike Kelley was born on October 27, 1954, in a small town of Wayne near Detroit in Michigan. The artist was quickly attracted to heavy metal music and started his first band when he was in high-school. But Mike Kelley's Destroy All Monsters wasn't an ordinary band, but rather a conceptual art project that created, zines, papers and performance pieces reminiscent of Dada theater. He graduated from the University of Michigan before he moved to Los Angeles to study on California Institute of the Arts. During his university days at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Calif the artist was influenced by Conceptual art focus nurtured by professors John Baldessari, Laurie Anderson and Douglas Huebler. He began creating multimedia installations that merged large-scale drawings and paintings, writings, along with sculptures, videos, and performances, often scatological and sadomasochistic in nature.2 In the 1980s the American artists moved away from music and performances and started using rags, dolls, blankets and similar materials to create possibly his most recognizable body of work.  Mike Kelley's celebrated More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages of Sin art installation made in 1987, consists of entangled dolls, animals, and blankets sewn onto a large canvas as the artist explored the fictional childhood scene with some visceral pathos.3 The artwork explores the relationship between parents and children and whether the love parents invest in their offspring could be or even should be repaid. In 1988, Kelley attracted attention yet again with an installation entitled Pay for Your Pleasure, that dealt with the connection between brilliance a madness. The artwork featured a gallery of portraits of genius men like poets, philosophers, and artists accompanied with quotes that suggested that madness, criminality and similar tendencies are impossible to separate from creativity. An artwork made by serial killer John Wayne Gacy was located at the end of the installation thus seemingly confirming the theory.   But Mike Kalley was never afraid of changes and when the audience entered MOCA to visit a group show dedicated to L.As finest artists they were greeted with artworks completely different from the childlike installations they are used to seeing. Mike Kelley’s Proposal for the Decoration of an Island of Conference Rooms (With Copy Room) for an Advertising Agency Designed by Frank Gehry installation represented a steady architectural piece that consisted of regular office cubes with generic furniture that were disrupted with an array of vulgar and sexually explicit statements written all over the walls. In November 2005 Mike Kelley stepped out of his comfort zone once again and surprised the audience with an artwork entitled Day is Done that dealt with extracurricular activities of high school kids trough 2.5 hours long video artwork. The piece that futures an array of religious and folk art motifs as well as numerous unusual characters including witches, a dancing devil as well as mimes and demons focus on trauma, abuse and various types of socially acceptable deviations often experienced by teenagers. From 1999 till 2011 the artist spent his time working on his Kandor series that retold the story of Superman. The Superman that believes that his planet Kandor was destroyed when he was a small boy suddenly gets the news that the planet is hijacked by Brainiac and kept inside of a glass bowl. Finally, Superman manages to retrieve Kandor from Brainiac and hides it in his Fortress of Solitude. The mix media installation entitled Fortress of Solitude represents the highlight of the unique exhibition.    In the early 2010s, everything seems to be going great for the prominent artist. His works were featured in the greatest institutions in the world, sold for million dollars at auctions and the artist was getting the recognition he deserved. On January 31, 2012, when the retrospective of his work was about to open at Stedelijk museum in Amsterdam the press and the art world were suddenly shocked with the news that Mike Kelley committed suicide in his home in South Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California. According to the press, Mike Kelley ended his life by carbon monoxide poisoning at the age of 57. Soon after his death spontaneous outburst of grief occurred on the site near his studio in Los Angeles, where people brought stuffed toys, blankets, and wax candles thus creating installations similar to his famous More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages of Sin artwork to celebrate his life and work. This mourning installation was later donated to Mike Kelley foundation that provides grants for innovative projects that reflect his multifaceted artistic practice.  Mike Kelley's famous exhibitions include Eternity is a Long Time at Hangar Bicocca in Milan, exhibition at UMMA - The University of Michigan Museum of Art in Michigan, Under the Big Black Sun California Art 1974-1988 at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, Los Angeles, California, ICA - Institute of Contemporary Art - University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, video works and a sprawling installation exhibition at Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City, exhibit at Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, in his home town of Detroit, Michigan, Kelley’s Kandors exhibition that (explored Kandor extensively) at Hauser & Wirth New York, Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam, American Academy in Rome Gallery, Rome, Skarstedt Fine Art gallery, New York City, Centre Pompidou, Musée National d´Art Moderne, Paris, France, Center for Contemporary Art, CCA Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, ACCA - Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, A Summer of American Masters with Robert Indiana in KM fine Arts gallery, Chicago, Boston University Art Gallery - BUAG, Boston, Michigan A Voyage of Growth and Discovery at Sculpture Center, New York, Mobile Homestead, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and participation in Whitney Biennial, New York City, NY in 2012.

Guggenheim Museum in New York, Tate Gallery in London, Collezione Maramotti, in Italy, Broad Collection and Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to name a few.  References:  ",1736
Zhang Xiaogang,"Zhang Xiaogang is one of the most influential and acknowledged painters in the contemporary art world of China. In his fruitful career, he managed to explore many social, philosophical and intimate subjects, developing a unique style and certain seriousness in his paintings. Using his own life, the lives of the people he shared political history with, and personal emotional turmoil, he put all his thought and reasoning into his  surreal and symbolic paintings. Growing up in China was not all roses and butterflies for this artist, and he spent many years rejuvenating and recuperating. Everything that he learned about socioeconomic and political occurrences and their impact on culture and art, he wrapped up in a symbol and shared his opinion through painting.   Xiaogang was born in 1958 in Kunming, to parents who worked for the government. His mother taught him how to draw and his playtime with crayons was a sort of disciplinary measure for him. When he was in adolescent age he was sent to work on a farm, as a part of the government program called Down to the Countryside Movement where young people from the city would be sent to the countryside in order to get practical skills. Many high-school graduates recall this time as the time of lost generation of China. While participating in physical labor on the farm, Xiaogang was concurrently learning how to paint. He learned how to work with watercolors and how to make sketches. This was the time of Cultural revolution, and the political outbreak strongly influenced Xiaogang's painting. He decided that art was his true calling and successfully enrolled the Sichuan Academy of Fine arts in 1977, where he studied oil painting.   Changes in his style and theme were directly related to fluctuations in the establishment and his personal life. He started out with paintings of rural scenery where he used tiny and distinctive brush strokes to emphasize movements in nature. Xiaogang always incorporated his personal beliefs into his work, and when the insinuate had to be censored, he would turn to subtle implications in style. For example, in the 80s, he imitated the brush work of Vincent Van Gogh when portraying the works in the field. When he was already a graduate, he began exploring his psychological and mental life, as well as the collective state of mind of his generation. The results were surrealistic paintings, full of symbols and tokens. He was personally going through a rough patch, and after spending almost two months in a hospital, he occupied his mind with contemplations about death, disease, and addiction. He managed to go through a period of profound melancholy and find the light at the end of a very dark road.   What he is most famous for is his Bloodline series that he started producing in the 90s and continued to release them throughout the first decade of 21st century. He established a distinctive style, strict and bold, supported by monochromatic palette and clean look, that made the portraits stand out even more. The theme was family and how relationships between family members were regulated. The policy of the house was directly established by the government and house rules were only modified and changed in secrecy. There is an issue of identity and class that Xiaogang painted in a Social-Realist style. Figures looked like each other but were given small remarks as a symbol of authenticity. People were depicted with slightly larger heads that distorted the symmetry of the body, implying big the head got from all the thoughts and unspoken opinions. The tension that lingers in his portraits metaphorically produces emotional disturbance, where the straight-back, wide-eyed persons try to communicate the struggle of the social pressure to fit in.   Fallen in the hands of unfortunate destiny, he used every single change in his life to dive into introspection. What this artist lived through can be described as enrollment in an unmerciful school of life, where the student has to learn a lesson and stay out of trouble. He went through many jobs, from teaching to working as a construction worker, but his spirit never gave up. He was, and still is, exploring the profound philosophy of individualism, of western philosophy and cultural ideology. These topics served as inspiration for his series of family portraits. After his trip to Germany in 1992, he gained a new perspective on Chinese collectivism and saw the absolute unique characters of his nation, where they unselfishly rely on each other for help, consolation and comfort, like one big family. Socialism and the relationship between culture in the city, and in rural areas, still serve as inspiration for him, as he quite often paints the environmental transformations and microevolution of everyday life in China. The artist is represented by Weng Contemporary Gallery.  All images used for illustrative purpose only © Zhang Xiaogang",1737
Sean Scully,"One of the most prominent abstract painters, Sean Scully creates under various historical and cultural influences of places that were important for him in some period of his life.  His work is based on repetition of the carefully arranged discretely nuanced blocks of color that make a dramatic effect and visual pleasure. Although his spaces are intentionally monumental, his paintings express distinctive intimacy in the essence.  The highly sensual and tactile materiality is a result of his approach that includes paint manipulations with the different brushstrokes. Simplifying his compositions, Scully’s repetitive forms resemble architectural elements and harmonious interaction of the colors evoke the profound emotional associations.   Born in Dublin in 1945, he was growing up in south London where his family moved four years later. He started his painting career in the late 60’s. Scully studied at Croydon College of Art and Newcastle University and was a recipient of a graduate fellowship at Harvard. In 1975, he moved to New York and eight years later became an American citizen. His art, entirely international in perspective, shows an influence of both Europe and America. From harmonic forms of ancient Greek architecture and stone walls in rural Ireland, he made the legacy of abstraction in the United states. He has exhibited worldwide and his work is a part of the permanent collections of a number of museums and public galleries, as Metropolitan Museum of Art, Guggenheim Museum and MoMA in New York, the Tate Gallery in London and the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin.    Consisting of a number of panels, his abstract paintings are made of thick layers of the oil paint which create textured surfaces. The brief period of hard-edge painting at the very beginning of his artistic expression left the trace and highly influenced by his latter approach. Although he abandoned the masking tape, the characteristic motif of the stripe remained present, but accomplished and refined over the time. In his recent works, Scully enhanced his distinctive stripes, but also evolving a principle of compositional patterning that reminds of a checkboard. As the artist himself stated, his style represents the dicey society of Ireland. He remembers that everything was in that shape, “even the fields and the people”.    The describing geometry of his work creates the structure for the expressive rendering of color, light and texture. In his strivings to combine intimacy and monumentality, Scully makes an emotional abstraction in his paintings. The integration of structured composition with the idiosyncrasies of the chosen medium is typical of Scully’s work; the artist has described this duality as a “battle between system and emotion.” Although he has spent almost his entire career working with the idea of the stripe or painted band, Scully’s body of work is complex and extensive, rigorously trying out new compositions and stretching the possibilities of a single motif.

Odeith,"Odeith, a Portuguese street artist, is one of the most talented names that have emerged into the world of graffiti and murals. He is famous for creating anamorphic 3D graffiti, which look like they are floating in the air if observed from the right angle. He also creates more traditional graffiti and large-scale, site-specific murals. All of his artworks are extremely detailed and realistic, almost photographic in their unbelievable precision. His style is also considered obscure and it is called sombre 3D, meaning dark three-dimensional style.  Odeith was born in Damaia, Portugal in the mid-70s and he started experimenting with colorful air sprays in the mid-1980s. However, it wasn't until the 90s that his graffiti began to spread throughout Portugal. Similarly to other young street artists, Odeith was practicing his early urban art on train tracks and in the suburban areas, and his passion for drawing started to grow together with his desire to spread his creativity and gain some feedback. At the same time, his talent went through a certain evolution and his murals and graffiti were becoming more complex, already heading towards the 3D feel. Odeith didn't take too much time to develop his personal, recognizable style - soon after his art became a bit more prominent on the streets of Damaia, he got the opportunity to paint large scale murals not only in his home town but also in various housing neighborhoods. In 1999, because of his unstoppable talent, Odeith became a tattoo artist as well and he opened a tattoo shop which closed in 2008 when the artist moved to London. He is currently back in Lisbon and creates murals in collaboration with the major companies such as Coca-cola, Portugal Roads and Samsung .   Odeith was one of the pioneers of 3D anamorphic art - he initiated this style in 2005. While painting on more than one surface (he often uses corner walls of various buildings), he creates a puzzling, illusionary feel of a floating object. Viewed from a specific angle, his art pops out of the wall, becoming dynamic and alive. Odeith's optical illusions are so strong that they leave the impression of something solid and palpable and it is truly hard to believe that these are regular flat-surface paintings and not sculptures, when seen from a certain distance. Odeith is internationally recognized for his jaw-dropping anamorphic 3D pieces and he is often invited to showcase his work outside of his native Portugal. However, everything started from Odeith's simple curiosity about perspective and shading - guided by his artistic instinct, he began creating carefully thought-out compositions with the amazing sense of spatial depth and his creative efforts stood out because of their peculiar technique.   Because of his incredible talent which resulted in some of the most beautiful murals ever made, Odeith won the prestigious international award for urban art, called I Support Street Art. His graffiti are not only visually striking, but they also offer a commentary on various social issues, such as poverty or consumerism. Some of his artworks pay homage to the important names in the world of art and literature, such as Bob Marley, legendary Portuguese guitarist Carlos Paredes or photographer Américo Ribeiro. Odeith’s murals resemble fine art because of their elaborate nature and amazingly skillful usage of colors and shading. Even though Odeith quit school when he was only 15 and never had any formal education, his art has reached the amazing level of perfection. In addition to talent, it takes a lot of creativity and innovation to get recognized in the contemporary art scene. Odeith comments on that - I was kind of tired of the conventional regular 3D letters so I was always searching for something original.   Odeith is a true renaissance man and a dreamer, who managed to make the entire urban art kingdom, which is highly praised and sought for. Never quit your dreams if you’re a dreamer. And sometimes, it may take a few years to earn credibility, Odeith likes to encourage his young fellow street artists. Nowadays, he is as busy as ever with all the commissions and collaborations with the international enterprises as well as selling canvas paintings featuring his best works. He also participates in numerous exhibitions and art fairs, with his continuously impressive and refreshing pieces.  ",1739
Alex Yanes,"Alex Yanes is an American artist whose inspiration derives from subcultures, his environment, fatherhood, life's circumstances, and ""the ability to create something out of nothing."" Born and based in an ever-evolving, fast-paced city - Miami, he has a reputation for being humble, preferring to let his work take the central stage. Since deciding to pursue art full-time in 2006, it has become his autobiography, speaking of his upbringing during the '80s and '90s. At first, Yanes created on canvas, but now his pieces become alive via wood, acrylic, resin, and enamel into three-dimensional installations. Each work provides a personal insight into the artist's view of the world and everything that caught his eye. Active in the community, Yanes has worked with local foundations, focusing on helping children and bolstering their love of art.",1740
Marino Marini,"Marino Marini was an Italian graphic artist, painter, and sculptor, born on February 27, 1901. Marini studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy, focusing on painting. A few years after finishing school, he changed his focus to sculpting. For his biggest influence Martini cited the sculptor Arturo Martini (Italian, 1889–1947) who worked at the Scuola d'Arte di Villa Reale in Monza as a professor. After giving up his position, younger Marini succeeded him. He worked at the school from 1929 to 1940. During this period, Marini traveled frequently to Paris, where he associated with Massimo Campigli, Giorgio de Chirico, Alberto Magnelli, and Filippo Tibertelli de Pisis. In 1936 he moved to Tenero-Locarno, in Ticino Canton, Switzerland. During the following few years the artist often visited Zürich and Basel, where he became a friend of Alberto Giacometti, Germaine Richier, and Fritz Wotruba. In 1936, he received the Prize of the Quadriennale of Rome. In 1938, he married Mercedes Pedrazzini. He accepted a professorship in sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, Milan, in 1940. In 1943, he went into exile in Switzerland, exhibiting in Basel, Bern, and Zurich. In 1946, the artist settled permanently in Milan. He participated in the Twentieth-Century Italian Art show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1944. Curt Valentin began exhibiting Marini’s work at his Buchholz Gallery in New York in 1950, on which occasion the sculptor visited the city and met Jean Arp, Max Beckmann, Alexander Calder, Lyonel Feininger, and Jacques Lipchitz. On his return to Europe, he stopped in London, where the Hanover Gallery had organized a solo show of his work, and there met Henry Moore. In 1951 a Marini exhibition traveled from the Kestner-Gesellschaft Hannover to the Kunstverein in Hamburg and the Haus der Kunst of Munich. He was awarded the Grand Prize for Sculpture at the Venice Biennale in 1952 and the Feltrinelli Prize at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome in 1954. One of his monumental sculptures was installed in the Hague in 1959. Retrospectives of Marini’s work took place at the Kunsthaus Zürich in 1962 and at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome in 1966. His paintings were exhibited for the first time at Toninelli Arte Moderna in Milan in 1963–64. In 1973 a permanent installation of his work opened at the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in Milan, and in 1978 a Marini show was presented at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. There is a museum dedicated to his work in Florence, in the former church of San Pancrazio. His work may also be found in museums and galleries such as the Civic Gallery of Modern Art in Milan, the Tate Collection, The Angel of the City at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, the Norton Simon Museum, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. Marini developed several themes in sculpture: Euestrian, Pomonas (Nudes), Portraits, and Circus figures. Marini is particularly famous for his series of stylised equestrian statues, which feature a man with outstretched arms on a horse. The horse and rider theme evolved over time. It first appeared in 1936, as poised and formal figures. In 1940, the forms became more abstract, proportions changed. After the war, the horses are posed standing straining, and a rider with outstretched arms. Marino Marini died on August 6, 1980. He is buried at Cimitero Comunale of Pistoia, Toscana, Italy.",1741
Russell Young,"British American artist Russell Young is known for his silkscreen paintings that show imagery of popular culture and its icons. Influenced by the world-renowned artist Andy Warhol, his Pop artworks include sculptures, paintings, prints, films, and installations. What makes his extensive oeuvre so unique is that Young constantly reinvents himself, never being afraid to experiment with new styles that regularly push his artistic expression. The feelings of isolation and entrapment from a lonely childhood are forever present in his work. Young artworks have been shown in exhibitions all around the world, including London, Detroit, Singapore, Miami.   Young, who was born in 1959 in Northern England, never knew who his birth parents were. From an early age, he was fascinated by the idea of the American dream, football, and the music by New Order and Sex Pistols. Young never enjoyed school and would often skip classes, yet his love for art could not be denied. The artist was a versatile student with a hunger for knowledge, he studied photography, film, graphic design, and drawing at Chester Art College and the Exeter College of Art. Soon after graduating, Young relocated to Los Angeles, where he began directing music videos and making commercial photography. However, in the 90s, his interest in painting began to grow. In 2003 he created a series of silkscreens titled Pig Portraits at the Don O'Melveny Gallery in Los Angeles, depicting mugshots of famous people. This exhibition captured the eye of the public, and his rise to stardom began in earnest.    Russell's signature style is silkscreen paintings that depict music and movie icons such as Kurt Cobain and Elizabeth Taylor. Since 2007 he incorporated the use of diamond dust as a finishing touch for his paintings which perfectly captured the sensual allure of the depicted subjects in his paintings titled Dirty Pretty Things. The artist reinvented himself after staying on the Greek island of Ithaca, where he began exploring the relationship between the natural world, the human body, and memory. Unfortunately, this prematurely after he almost died having contracted the H1N1. After waking up from an 8-day coma, Young had to relearn how to write and read. A new chapter in his artistic expression begins, showing a more mature approach that can be best seen in the series Helter Skelter. Here he used the disturbing images that show the murder of Meredith Hunter at the 1968 Rolling Stones Altamont Free Concert.   Besides painting, Russell Young has also directed numerous music videos for numerous artists, including Eartha Kitt and Brand New Heavies. Today he is the most sought out contemporary artist, and a number of celebrities have bought his artworks, among them Kanye West, Brad Pitt, and the former President Barack Obama. His artworks are part of collections of the Cornell Art Museum, the Saatchi Collection, the ​​Albertina Museum, and the White House Collection.   Russell Young lives and works between Los Angeles and New York.

Pierre Soulages,"We associate black with sadness, death, darkness. Many of us are simply unable to see the bright side of it. And yet, a chosen few, like Pierre Soulages, have dedicated their entire career to one specific color. It’s not that unusual – many choose monochrome painting as a form of expression and they work predominantly with just one color. And yet, only some actually achieve a level of mastery necessary to keep all the paintings fresh and original. Without difficulties, Soulages have remained one of the unique painters of the 20th century. When he decided to paint light and snow with black, that uniqueness became even more apparent.   When he was just six years old, his older sister found him drawing thick black lines in ink with a brush and asked: “What are you painting, my little Pierre?” He replied: “Snow”.[1] Nine decades later, after giving it another meaning, he is the king of black. Born in Rodez, he was attracted as very young to Romanesque artistic traditions and prehistory. He began his career in this isolated province that has not followed the contemporary artistic trends. At the age of 18, he went to Paris to prepare for the entrance examination to the prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. Initially accepted into the school, Soulages, convinced of the poor quality of education, refused to even start his studies and went back to Rodez. While he was in Paris, he frequently visited the exhibitions of Cézanne and Picasso that were taking place at the Louvre. The WWII broke out and he was soon mobilized. After Paris was occupied, he was demobilized and went to Montpellier where he regularly attended the Musée Fabre. However, Montpellier was also quickly occupied, and he spent the next period escaping the Service du travail obligatoire (the Nazis deported hundreds of thousands of French workers to Germany to work as forced labor for the German war effort). During this time of constant conflict and hiding, he didn’t paint.  It was not until 1946 that he could devote all of his time to painting. Having settled in Paris once again, Soulages began creating abstract and dark paintings, dominated by black. These pieces, heavily influenced by the atrocities of war, were immediately noticed as they differed significantly from the semi-figurative painting and colorful post-war tendencies. In 1948, he began participating in exhibitions in Paris and Europe. One of the most known shows was Französische abstrakte malerei, exhibited in several German museums. Soulages was by far the youngest in this small group of masters of abstraction that included Kupka, Herbin, Domela, etc. The poster for the show depicted one of his paintings, and it was a huge acknowledgment and inspiration for the young artist. A year later, he had his first solo show in Paris, at the Lydia Conti gallery, and he also continued participating in group exhibitions throughout the world, including London, Copenhagen, and Sao Paolo. From 1949-1952, the artist made his first engravings at the Lacourière workshop in Paris. Over the next few years, the Americans had an opportunity to have themselves acquainted with his work, as several of the shows he was participating in were traveling exhibitions, such as Advancing French Art in 1951, Younger European Painters in 1953, and The New Decade in 1955. He exhibited regularly at the Koot Gallery in The Big Apple and Galerie de France in Paris. In the early ‘50s, his pieces were already acquired by some prestigious galleries and museums, such as Phillips Gallery in Washington, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Tate Gallery in London, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Museu de arte moderna in Rio de Janeiro, and many others. Today, Soulages’ paintings (over 230) are included in permanent collections of more than 110 museums on all continents. In 1960, he had first retrospective exhibitions in museums in Hanover, Essen, Zurich, The Hague. Changing his approach in 1979, that very year he exhibited at Centre George Pompidou. From 1987 to 1994, he produced the 104 windows for the abbey of Conques (the very same place where he had his first profound aesthetic experience). In 2001, he became the first living artist to exhibit at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. In October 2009, celebrating its 90th anniversary, the Centre Pompidou presented the largest retrospective ever devoted to a living artist since the early ‘80s, with more than 2000 square meters of exhibition space. Even with the staff strike that occurred, the exposure received more than half a million visitors, making it the fourth most popular exhibition in the history of Centre Pompidou.[2]   When Soulages first got to Paris, he tried to show his work at the Salon d'Automne, but they didn't accept him. A friend told him about the Salon des Surindépendants, which didn't have a jury, so he showed my work there for the first time. The piece was very dark, standing out in a mass of yellow and red paintings. Quite different from the rest, the painting caught the eye of Francis Picabia, who called it the best in the show. A few days later, the two of them met, and Picabia encouraged Soulages with kind words. In 1948, as stated above, the artist was invited to participate along the masters of abstraction such as Kupka, Herbin, Hartung, Schneider, a group of people much older than him and already established. That same year an American who had heard about his work came to Soulages’ studio in Paris. It was no other than James Johnson Sweeney (a painting curator at MoMA at the time, and later the director of the Guggenheim Museum in New York). Sweeney said he liked everything he saw and bought one of the paintings. After one of the traveling shows, Soulages attracted the attention of Duncan Phillips, who personally bought one painting for the Phillips Collection in Washington D.C.  In 1954, Samuel Kootz began to represent the artist. All of the interest for Soulages’ work was a bit strange considering that he didn’t actually visit the States until 1957. Upon arriving to New York, he was invited to a dinner at the Sam Hunter’s house (Hunter was a curator at MoMA). There he had the honor of meeting some of the most famous American painters, including Mark Rothko and Theodoros Stamos. He ended up befriending Franz Kline,  Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning. A not so funny scene with Rothko marked the lifelong friendship between the two. At Hunter’s, Rothko initially attacked Soulages, saying: “Soulages is Europe, and I'm familiar with European museums. European museums have men with their arms out, with nails in their hands and blood flowing. They have men with thorns in their foreheads and blood flowing. They have men shot with arrows and blood flowing. They have women carrying heads on platters and blood flowing. Europe! Concentration camps, gas chambers, crematoriums. Me, I prefer bird songs.”[3] At first, the Frenchman didn’t know how to respond, and then he simply repeated everything that Rothko said, adding: “I have yet to see the American Indian museums”. Rothko invited him to a lunch the next day, and so their friendship began.   Soulages’ first profound aesthetic experience was in the interior of the Romanesque abbey of Conques. A real epiphany followed shortly afterward. Through a book (a reproduction of the Bison of Altamira), he realized just how narrow was the history of art taught at schools or exposed in museums. With only 5 or 6 previous centuries (that number expands to about 26 when the Greek culture is included), and that doesn’t even compare with the age of the Bison of Altamira, which was a hundred and eighty centuries old. From that moment, Soulages wanted to discover everything about painting, to go all the way back to its most distant origins, to learn about the practices present in other countries, continents.[4] The paintings of the prehistoric era, which was revealed in a succession of waves, impressed him by the force of their presence which went far beyond the concern for illusionistic representation that ended up in the study of perspective. These vast painted spaces inspired a desire for freedom that was so rarely matched since.  Certainly, the Greeks have one of the first intentionally cultivated artistic practices, with their beautiful women and handsome man, but something like that never interested Soulages. Being against limitations like perspective, he considers perspective to be an illusion. It is opposite of presence, and art is presence. All of this led to him meeting the love of his life, Collete, the woman he has spent more than 7 decades with! It was a love at first sight! They had the same taste and shared an interest in pre-Renaissance practices. As established, he was intrigued by pre-historic period, while she wanted to learn about medieval art, which nobody knew back then. Even today, the number of experts in those fields is next to non-existing. On February 13th, 1941, the painter arrived at Montpellier and immediately went to the school where you could only become a drawing teacher. There he met this girl who was trying to convince some boys that Picasso was a great artist. Soulages told her she’s never going to convince those idiots, and since he was planning to go to the Musée Fabre, he asked her to join him. Collete went with him and they haven’t been apart since. As for his style – Soulages’ early paintings are given to sections more than a holistic intake, a feature he still possesses. The works made ‘back in the day’ suggest a more symbolic aspect, a kind of contradiction between form and space, between the gesture and the surface, between the support and its interior. These painterly ideas were closer to Soulages than the more metaphorical interpretations of being an expression of post-World War II trauma where hope lingers in the crevices between the charred remnants (a popular interpretation that Soulages attempted to discourage).[5] Soulages was always painting with black, and yet, it was his travels and discovery of “beyond black” that made the true earthquake in the artistic world. It happened in 1979, while he was working for many hours on a painting, with black paint everywhere. Exhausted, he couldn’t quite comprehend why he was working for so long on something that he didn’t like. The piece was simply not turning out as the others. So, after a quick sleep, he looked at it once again and made a decision that was going to change his life – no more painting with black. Instead, he will paint with the light reflected off the black surface.  This spur of the moment realization deeply touched him, so he continued making pieces like this. The Centre Pompidou invited him to show these works, which people began calling noir lumière, or black light. The name suggested an optical effect, and the Soulage didn’t like it. He only started making these because he found that the light reflected by the black surface elicits certain emotions in him. They are not monochromes. The light is coming from the color which represents the absence of light, and these paintings are very moving. Having realized that he needs to find an appropriate word to convey mental field opened up by these works, Soulages invented the word outrenoir – it doesn’t exist in English, and its closest interpretation is “beyond black”. It’s a completely different thing from black, a completely different place. More recent paintings (from 2013-14) have surfaces that reveal more literal variations of black pigment, often utilizing an uncompromising matt underpainting as a support for glossy black on top. Alternatively, the light refracts from severe cuts into a hardened density of pigment. Since 1979, the focus has always been on the birth of light from the blackness. The most recent paintings constitute a latent subterfuge, whereby the light bounces rhythmically from one panel to another within a single painting.   Soulages has liberated his style from centuries of Western decorative painting traditions and drawing that dated back in prehistoric times. His work is a pure celebration of the very essence of painting – there are primal instinct to create and the spiritual power of lines and movement.[6] The Museum in his hometown is an homage to his vision and long-lasting career. His true legacy lies in the fact that he was able to bring out from the darkness something pure and beautiful. He found light in black, a feat that is extremely difficult. He is represented by Galerie Perrotin and We Art Partners.  References:  ",1743
Jean-Paul Riopelle,"Jean-Paul Riopelle was a Canadian painter, born on October 7, 1923 in Montreal, Canada. He became the first Canadian painter, since James Wilson Morrice, to attain widespread international recognition. Riopelle started taking drawing lessons with Henri Bisson in 1933 and continued through 1938. He studied engineering, architecture and photography at the École polytechnique in 1941. In 1942 he enrolled at the École des beaux-arts de Montréal but shifted his studies to the less academic École du meuble, graduating in 1945. The painter Paul-Émile Borduas was teaching at the École du meuble and had Riopelle as a student. Riopelle rebelled against Borduas at first because Borduas didn’t appreciate his ability to make “realistic” paintings in the manner he had learned from Bisson. He has remarked that he was the “provocateur” in Borduas’s classes, but he slowly opened himself to a freer, more spontaneous style of painting. Riopelle began experimenting with Marcel Barbeau, Jean-Paul Mousseau and Bernard Morisset in a makeshift studio and produced what could be described as his first Automatist paintings. Painted with commercial house paint on jute for lack of money for better materials, little of this work has survived. By 1947, Riopelle had produced a sufficient number of works that qualify as Automatist, that his style could be fully appreciated. The painting he exhibited at Véhémences confrontées in 1950, a show organized by the art critic Michel Tapié and the painter Georges Matthieu at the Galerie Nina Dausset in Paris, was inspired by a Jackson Pollock painting Tapié described as “amorphique,” meaning formless or purely material. The description fit Riopelle’s painting better than Pollock’s. In a text accompanying the exhibition, Riopelle claimed that only “total chance” could open his painting to new discoveries. He then expressed the desire to detach himself from the Automatists, though his paintings and technique remained faithful to the idea of complete spontaneity. In the 1950s, Riopelle developed his well-known, mature style of creating large, colour mosaic paintings executed with a palette knife and by squeezing colors onto the canvas directly from the tube. One such painting, Blue Night (1953), was included in Younger European Painters, an exhibition organized in 1953 by James Johnson Sweeney at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Shortly thereafter, Riopelle signed on with the Pierre Matisse Gallery, owned by the son of the great French artist Henri Matisse, which was devoted to French avant-garde artists in New York. Important New York art critics like Frank O’Hara, a poet and renowned curator at the Museum of Modern Art, recognized Riopelle’s importance and compared him to Jackson Pollock. In Paris, Riopelle was close to a number of American expatriate painters, among them Sam Francis, who remained a close friend for the rest of his life. It is in this context that he met Joan Mitchell, with whom he had a stormy relationship that lasted 25 years. Both of them resisted the trend prevalent in the French avant-garde of the time to follow Picasso, and instead became interested in Monet’s immense paintings of his floating gardens in Giverny, near Paris. Throughout the 1960s, Mitchell and Riopelle maintained separate homes and studios near Giverny. In 1970, Riopelle exhibited a plaster version of his monumental sculpture, La Joute, at the Galerie Maeght in Paris. The model was cast in bronze in Italy in 1974, and two years later installed at the Olympic Stadium in Montréal. It was subsequently installed at the Place Riopelle in the heart of Montréal’s commercial district. Over time, Riopelle visited Canada more and more frequently, first to hunt but also to paint. It was only in 1989 that he returned to Quebec definitively. His fascination with animals gave birth to numerous engravings that constitute a highly original bestiary, as well as many depictions of Canadian geese. He had a studio at Sainte-Marguerite-du-Lac-Masson (from 1974), at l’Estérel (from 1990), and finally at l’Isle-aux-Oies (1994–2002). During his final period, Riopelle had ceased using palette knives but used spray cans instead, often spraying over objects set on the canvas. The public had difficulty understanding his late style, but when he painted his huge Hommage à Rosa Luxemburg shortly after hearing about the death of Joan Mitchell in 1992, it was impossible to deny that Riopelle had mastered a new technique inspired by urban graffiti. The Hommage might be described as a coded message about his life with Mitchell. When Riopelle died 12 March 2002 at Isle-aux-Grues, a state funeral was organized in his honour. It can be said without exaggeration that he was the best internationally known Canadian painter of his era, his work represented in all the great museums of the world.",1744
Erwin Olaf,"Erwin Olaf is a Dutch photographer famous for mixing photojournalism with studio photography. He was born in Hilversum in the Netherlands and studied journalism in the School of Journalism in Utrecht. Olaf emerged on the international art scene in 1988, when his series Chessmen was awarded the first prize in the Young European Photographer competition. This award was followed by an exhibition at the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany in the same year. In his earlier work on the subject of social exclusion Olaf was deliberately disturbing with the intention of raising awareness and he was dedicated towards exploring issues of class, race, sexual taste, beliefs, habits and grace. In 1987 he began working with film, which has since then continued to be an important medium for his art. Often these movies provide a parallel history to his colour photography. In the past years Olaf's films have been screened at several leading museums and film festivals all around the world. A selection of screenings at museums as Centre Pompidou - Paris, Reina Sofia National Museum - Madrid, SCCA, Centre for Contemporary Art - Ljubljana, and the Museum at FIT &ndash; New York City. A selection of screenings at film festivals: Fashion Film Festival - Melbourne, Rencontres International Film festival - Paris, International Film Festival Turkey - Ankara, EMAF Festival - Osnabrück, Dutch International Film Festival -Rotterdam. Erwin Olaf's art implicitly visualizes the unspoken, the overlooked, that which typically resists easy documentation. Olaf's trademark is to address social issues, taboos and bourgeois conventions within the framework of a highly stylised and cunning mode of imagery. With the aid of his razor-sharp aesthetic intuition, Olaf purposely conceals his themes so that the viewer unconsciously and initially accepts the concealment found in his photo series. Yet in the end, his unconventional style never fails to deliver dramatic visual and emotional impact. By providing scenic and striking design, along with the utmost perfect composition in his typical, immaculate 'OWN' style, combined with his passion for conceiving flawless scenarios, he vividly captures the essence of contemporary life. An ever-rising photographer, his work constantly garners new attention, and maintains the respect of his loyal fans. His ‘oeuvre’ is a manifestation of his incredible passion and genuine engagement with subjects. Olaf has been professionally active for over twenty-five years, and in this period he has succeeded in evolving from a participating photographer to a director who creates his own reality. Olaf’s pictures are filled with humor, imagination and exuberance, but they go much further than simple visual intrigue. His work broach ideas and visions of freedom, beauty, loneliness, and being different. He convinces his public in a shameless and versatile manner, questioning established norms. Olaf consistently expresses his own standpoints, fulminating against narrow-mindedness, smugness, and rigid norms, but not without humor, bravura and bite. In 2013 Erwin Olaf's design for the new national side of the Dutch euro coins was selected from 12 designs by competing artists. In the beginning of 2014 the new coins came into circulation. Aperture  published a new book in the fall of 2014. The book is an overview of Erwin Olaf's work throughout the years, including his most recent work. He lives in Amsterdam (the Netherlands).",1745
Michael Dweck,"Michael Dweck is an American artist born on September 26, 1957 in Brooklyn, New York to David and Sydelle Dweck. He is known for his seductive photographic style and pursuit of alluring subject matter, principally the female form and locales that offer their own particular enchantments. His developing narrative of a somewhat upended version of the theme Paradise Lost and Regained would favor privilege, youth, beauty, and the temptations of the flesh, although the photographic project at once records and fictionalizes what is inevitably receding and thus ever elusive. Dweck studied Fine Arts at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and began his career in advertising where he went on to become a highly regarded Creative Director receiving over 40 international awards, including the coveted Gold Lion at the Cannes International Festival in France. Having taken up photography at an early age and used it throughout his career, he left advertising to focus on photography full time in early 2001. Dweck happens to be something of an islander in spirit, raised as he was on Long Island, New York. He has a profound sense of place and community, and his work is thus usually situated in a vivid geographic and social context. His first major photographic work was published in 2004 in volume form as The End: Montauk, N.Y. and portrays the old fishing community of Montauk and its surfing subculture, at the very end of Long Island, as far away from New York City as is geographically possible. It is an evocation of a real-world paradise lost: of summer, youth, and erotic possibility, of community and camaraderie in a special place apart, an American version of the Arcadian vision. Blending nostalgia, fantasy, and documentation the photographs present a compelling portrait of a place in time and a way of life at once fading and being reinvented with each new season. These photographs were featured in several exhibitions and art fairs over the next couple of years. In 2008, he returned with Mermaids, an international exhibition with accompanying volume photographed in Montauk, Amagansett and the vicinity of the Weeki Wachee River in Florida. Its origins traced back to moonlit fishing expeditions on Long Island where, seduced by the ancient allure of the mermaid, he imagined the shadowy shapes of fish passing swiftly by just under the surface to be the fleeting forms of beautiful women. Dweck’s images, while often abstracting the female body in a painterly swirl of watery refractions, celebrate the physical charm of the feminine form and the meditative isolation of the underwater world. His third published work, Michael Dweck: Habana Libre is a contemporary, personal exploration of a secretive social order within Cuba. The privileged creative class in a classless society. This visual narrative is a story suggested, never told, its subtext is an allegory of seduction, a forbidden island that embodies a provocative mix of danger, tension, authority and mystery, teeming with an intoxicating air of sensuality and a rhythmic, almost hypnotic undercurrent. His photographs were first showcased at Sotheby’s, New York, in 2003, in their first solo exhibition for a living photographer. Dweck’s work has become part of important international art collections and has been exhibited extensively throughout the world, with solo exhibitions at the Staley-Wise Gallery, New York, Modernism, San Francisco, Acte2, Paris, Maruani & Noirhomme, Belgium, Robert Morat Galerie, Hamburg, and the Blitz Gallery, Tokyo. His work has also been shown at the Fahey/Klein Gallery, Los Angeles, and the Eric Franck Fine Art, London. Michael Dweck currently lives in New York City and Montauk.",1746
Franz Kline,"Starting from the realistic style based on the academic training and admiration of the Old Masters, Franz Kline made a turning point in his career by moving to New York, where he met Willem de Kooning who influenced the change of his artistic approach towards abstraction. Inspired by urban surroundings of the big city, a landscape of his home in rural Pennsylvania, and Japanese calligraphy, the artist transfused these motifs into the recognizable large black-and-white paintings which helped establishment of Gestural Abstraction as an important segment within Abstract Expressionism. Striving to achieve a physical engagement with the viewer, Kline’s powerful forms and their impressions of agility and promptness tended toward creating an experience of structure and almost palpable presence. Along with other action painters like de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and Lee Krasner, he was a prominent member of the New York School group of artists. Decisively rejecting the idea of hidden meanings of the artworks, his principles influenced a later generation of Minimalist sculptors as Donald Judd and Richard Sera.  Kline was born in 1910, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the small mining town, a not much supportive climate for the future artist. His father committed suicide when he was seven years old and his mother remarried and sent her son to Girard College, a school for fatherless boys, which the small Kline considered for the orphanage. Determined to create a better future for himself, he worked as a cartoonist for a school paper and managed to enroll the Boston University’s School of Art where he had a chance to see city’s private and public collections. After the brief studies at Art Students League in New York, he spent a year in England at Heatherly’s School of Art in London. There he met ballet dancer, Elizabeth V. Parsons who became his wife. They returned to the United States in 1938. At the beginning, Kline worked as a designer for a department store in New York State and after the moving to New York City, the painter had to accept different jobs like painting the murals in bars and making illustrations for the newspapers. His style still relied on the Old Masters, such as Rembrandt, until 1943 when he met Willem de Kooning who brought him in the Cedar Bar introduced with Jackson Pollock and Philip Guston. Under their influence, Kline began to move away from the figuration, exploring the new abstract gestural technique on the large scale paintings. Already using black-and-white palette in a series of ink on paper sketches, Kline now expanded the method employed the canvas and house-painting brushes that enabled him to create broad strokes of dark color intersecting the white background. It is believed that de Kooning also impacted him to scale up the work, encouraging him to explore the paintings using an enlarger – Bell-Opticon projector to project a sketch onto the wall of his studio. “A four by the five-inch black drawing of a rocking chair...loomed in gigantic black strokes which eradicated any image, the strokes expanding as entities in themselves, unrelated to any entity but that of their own existence.” – the painter explained his observations. Exactly these pieces were the part of Kline’s first solo show at Charles Egan Gallery in New York in 1950, an event that established his reputation of recognized abstract painter. Eleven canvases displayed different compositions and moods, but reflected unity in an essential element, marking his signature style of black on white. Although the critics related his paintings to the Japanese calligraphy, Kline denied it, asserting that his inspiration came only from unconscious sources. Asked to explain the meaning of his art, Kline claimed that his aim was not to impose the suggestions, but to let the viewer feel the painting at its sole discretion. Unlike his contemporaries, such as Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman whose art expressed an urge to transcendence, Kline was focused on pure abstract forms and gesture itself, deprived of any symbolic character or “painting experience”.  During the second half of the 1950’s, he decided to enrich his black-and-white palette, starting experiments with color and more complex chiaroscuro, emphasizing the sense of space.   Among the pieces shown at his first solo exhibition in 1950 was the canvas entitled Chief that indubitably referred his childhood, maybe the locomotive with the same name, her power, sound and steaming engine he remembered, or, as some also believed, that the artists fascination with dark color was the result of his growing up in the mining community. It is also important to mention that his early abstractions had the resemblance with Kline’s drawings of his wife Elizabeth. He made numerous sketches of her sitting in a rocking chair in the years when her mental illness progressed. The circular forms in Chief could be compared with her face in the drawings. Painting No. 7 (1952) is one of the finest examples of his black-and-white pictures. Never experimenting with figurative elements in his mature work, the strict geometry of broad dark brushstrokes determined this composition, maybe referring his admiration of iconic squares by Kazimir Malevich.   Exploring the angular compositions, the artist created Four Square (1956) which also represents one of the finest realizations of his gestural approach to painting. Through its rigid composition, the viewer had the myriad ways to comprehend the image, seeing as either a close-up of linguistic symbol or maybe a set of open windows. Unlike the other Abstract Expressionists who preferred two-dimensional treatment, Kline strived toward three-dimensional visual effect and impression of depth using the dynamic juxtapositions of vertical and horizontal strokes, overlapped with diagonal lines. An early attempt at recovery of color in his work is seen in Black Reflection (1956) and referred to contemporary paintings of de Kooning and Hans Hofmann. Focusing on the dark shape that he previously announced in the Untitled composition from 1954, Kline confirmed his devotion to pictorial forms. The example of his late work characterized by wider palette, Probst I (1960) represents a review of artist Jack Probst, who was his neighbor at Greenwich Village. At first glance, it seems like any other black-and-white painting but more carefully observed, there are traces of yellow and pale salmon that adorn severity of dark shapes, giving the sense of warmth. With a strong architectonic impression of its composition, Meryon (1960) could be distinctive representation of a clock tower by the nineteenth-century French artist Charles Meryon. Typical for Kline, the artist painted his own vision of this object, conceived through numerous preliminary studies and sketches.   These experiments with color use remained unfinished, interrupted by his sudden death caused by heart failure at the age of only fifty-two, on May 13, 1962. By this time, Franz Kline was already considered as a leading Abstract Expressionist with a considerable number of exhibitions behind both in the United States and abroad, including the Venice Biennale in 1960 and American Vanguard in 1961, a show that traveled throughout Europe, organized by the US government as an effort to advance itself as a guardian of free expression during the Cold War. His style was greatly distinguished among his peers Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and others and his label of action painter rested on his spontaneous and intense approach focused on the expression of the brushstrokes and use of canvas instead of imagery or literal content of the painting. His paintings only seemed like they were done in a moment of inspiration, but the truth is that Kline carefully prepared extensive studies for each of his pieces. A bit forgot after his death, Franz Kline got into the limelight during the art market boom in the late 1980’s. In 2012, his untitled black-and-white work from 1957 was sold for $36 million, a record price for the artist at auction. His previously sold Crow Dancer (1958) reached the price of “only” $6.4 million. The new generation of Minimalists found their inspiration in his work, especially attracted by the feeling of power transferred through the architectonic forms of his motifs. ",1747
Gary Hume,"In many ways the key figure of the famous Young British Artist moment, Gary Hume is an English author best known for his highly stylized pictorial depictions of everyday objects created with high-gloss industrial paint. Via his colorful and kitsch work that is one of the finest and mildest examples emerging from the oftentimes extreme arts of the YBA, Gary explores the dualities of our nature, investigating such notions as desire, repulsion, sexuality and innocence[1]. Hume's art and its development was an interesting journey that saw him change many styles and subjects, starting with the minimalistic, abstract compositions and ending up with much more fluid, borderline lyrical images of animals and celebrities.  Gary Hume was born during the year of 1962, in Tenterden, a town in the Ashford District of Kent, England. He attended Homewood School before he went to study at the Goldsmiths College, where he graduated in 1988. Gary's early works were a part of two very important YBA exhibitions - The Freeze, a show organized by Damien Hirst in 1988, and East Country Yard, a warehouse exhibition organized by Henry Bond and Sarah Lucas in 1990. Soon, Hume became nationally known for his depictions of everyday subjects using high-gloss industrial paints that made his work truly stand out. His earliest notable series of artworks was the now iconic Door Paintings project[2]. These were life-size representations of hospital doors that were shown in England, Germany and the United States. Hume finally abandoned doors as a subject in the mid-1990s, turning to paintings in household gloss paint on aluminum panels. For these, Gary often used appropriated images, including the pictures of celebrities and animals.    Hume's work was included in the 1995 exhibition Brilliant!, a showcase of works that paid tribute to the successes of the YBA. From around that point on, his forms and colors were dramatically simplified, with people being reduced to just two or three colors per the depicted individual. Initially, Hume used mainly bright colors but later turned towards much more muted tones. Gary's Yellow Window (2002) was a genuine milestone for both the author and the British contemporary art history as it broke records when sold at auction at Christie's[3]. Interestingly, Hume revisited his Door pictures in 2005 when he started arranging them into pairs of lovers and giving them the titles The Couple and The Argument. Besides his regular studio in London, this artist also maintains a second studio in a converted barn on the grounds of a former chicken farm in New York's Catskill Mountains region. This alternative location offers the author with an abundance of different creative stimulates, as evidenced by Gary himself who stated the following concerning his New York studio: Where I live in New York, there's a wood. I heard an owl in the night. Next day I found one of those ""Happy Birthday"" balloons caught in the trees. It had almost deflated. I imagined the owl, utterly indifferent, watching the balloon float by as it slowly collapsed. That's how I see life. I'm the owl, totally disengaged as the balloon bobs.   The edge is the only thing that matters. I used to think of the areas of color as tectonic plates meeting, so in the paintings it’s like there are these molten plates that would hit each other and dry. I wanted one of those plates to be higher than the other, and I wanted the hit to be more abrupt.[4] This principle and approach to art making, as the artist explained himself, caused the simplified, reductive aesthetic that made Gary so important for the YBA moment. By exuberantly embracing kitsch and developing highly stylized aesthetics, Hume managed to make a compromise between representation and abstraction. For that reason, his vibrant color contrasts and flat, Pop-like compositions cemented this author's name in the history of British contemporary art. This artist is represented by White Cube Bermondsey London, Weng Contemporary, Galerie Fluegel-Roncak and White Cube Mason's Yard London.  References:   ",1748
Donald Baechler,"American artist Donald Baechler's painting-collage-drawings are inspired by pop culture, folk and contemporary art, art history, and childhood imagery. As a member of the East Village art scene in 1980s New York, his work was influenced by such masters as Andy Warhol. Today the artist's work is part of several international private and public collections, including The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, The Centre George Pompidou in Paris, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and The Whitney Museum of American Art.   Donald Baechler was born in 1956 in Hartford, Connecticut. From a young age, he expressed interest in pursuing an art career, and after attending Maryland Institute College of Art, he graduated with M.F.A. from Cooper Union. Baechler found the art scene at Cooper to be boring. The artist said: After meeting several exchange students from Germany, he found their approach to art was closer to his own. He went on to study at the Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste Städelschule in Frankfurt. After a year in Germany, the artist met art dealer Shafrazi, who began promoting his work, and he quickly became part of the Lower Manhattan art scene. Soon after, in 1987, he participated in the São Paulo Biennial, and in 1989 his work was shown at the Whitney Biennial. Unfortunately, Baechler never really felt fully comfortable in the gallery setting as his work defined any categorization, for he intentionally the artist combined movements and schools.   In the 1980s, the Neo-Expressionist movement was on the rise in the United States, and Baechler became a prominent artist of the movement. In his work, sophistication and innocence are perfectly balanced. Through the use of vivid colors, he created vibrant images that burst with energy. The artist incorporated symbols, images from popular culture, and Pop imagery making him one of the leading contemporary artists. Collage works often feature faces or flowers giving a sense of childlike paintings, like, for example, his early piece entitled Fists of Fury (1983). Baechler said: Besides his work, the artist's studio in Crosby Street, Lower Manhattan, also contained a vast archive of objects he found, such as pieces of cloth, bits of paper, and discarded toys. Eventually, he would use them for collages. Although his paintings look simple, they are anything but, as the artist carefully thinks and weights every line or drop.   Throughout his career, Donald Baechler had numerous exhibitions, including Flowers (2021) at Galerie Crone in Berlin, Recent Birds (2021) at Anna Bohman Gallery in Stockholm, and Remedy of Anything (2021) at McClain Gallery in Houston, Texas. In 2022 the artist, aged 65, passed away in New York City.  ",1749
Billy Childish,"Billy Childish is a prolific British artist, punk rocker, poet, and novelist. Unconventional, rebellious, and controversial visionary, his body of work documents and explores his struggles coming to terms with addiction, abuse, and a childhood spent in a dysfunctional family. Born in 1959 in Chatham, Kent, England as Steven John Hamper, while growing up in Chatham, with a brother and abusive father, Billy experienced a great deal of trauma. When he was seven, his father abandoned home, and Billy was sexually abused by a male friend of the family’s at age nine. Billy left high school at age sixteen, while struggling with undiagnosed dyslexia, and became an apprentice stonemason at the Naval Dockyard in Chatham. Initially denied an interview to the local art school, he produced over 600 drawings that gained him entry to St. Martin's School of Art. Childish's defiance to authority led to his eventual expulsion from art school in 1981. Childish then embarked on an artistic odyssey exploring a broad range of worldly themes including war, history, and social protest. Childish’s art forms consist of woodcuts, collages, paintings, and Pin-Hole Camera photography. His paintings are created using etching, watercolors, oils, charcoal and sketches. Advocating amateurism, and free, emotional expression through art, Childish does not believe in the need to prove oneself with a title of professional artist. He feels that amateurs produce art through love, and professional artists produce for wealth. Billy Childish uses worldly themes for his art. War, social protest issues, history, religious philosophy, sexual abuse, and alcoholism are a few of his most predominant themes. These are themes which are very personal to Billy, as he battled alcoholism for fifteen years. In his paintings of erupting volcanoes, pastoral scenes, and portraits of musicians and mountaineers, ominous skies and shadowy figures seem to swirl across the canvas in an Expressionistic manner and emotional intensity, recalling the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh and Edvard Munch. A co-founder of the Stuckism art movement with Charles Thomson in 1999, Childish promotes figurative painting as opposed to conceptual art, and a quest for making art a part of personal discovery. The group was strongly pro-figurative painting and anti-conceptual art. Childish wrote a number of manifestos with Thomson, the first of which contained the statement ‘Artists who don't paint aren't artists.’ Although he had an early and close association with many of the artists who became known as YBA, Young British Artists, he has resolutely asserted his independent status. Over the last 35 years, Childish has gained a cult status worldwide. In addition to writing and publishing over 40 volumes of confessional poetry and 5 novels, Childish has recorded over 100 LPs and painted many hundreds of paintings. Billy Childish has had solo and group exhibitions internationally with recent solo exhibitions in New York, London, and Berlin. ",1750
Gavin Turk,"Gavin Turk is a British artist who questions the conceptual foundations of contemporary art. He is a photographer and sculptor. Since the beginning of his career he wanted to explore the role of art in modern society, so naturally he is prone to have many philosophical inquiries. He belongs to the group of Young British Artist from the 1990s. His main interests are identity and authenticity. Quite often he uses his own character and reflection in his sculptures and installations. What art reveals in the artist is what his subject should be. How we perceive the world and how the world observes us is what interferes with our own reflection of self.    Turk was showing amazing artistic talent since he was a child, and he started experiencing the world around him through colors, shapes and creations. He studied at Chelsea School of Art and continued his education at the Royal College of Art. However, he never graduated and did not receive his MA diploma because he caused a controversy and that escalation was the best career move he could never imagine that could happen. Turk set up an installation called the Cave which consisted of white painted room with blue plaque alike the ones that could be found on historical sites, saying Gavin Turk worked here, 1989-1991. His professors were not pleased with this act of egoism, and although that was not his intention, he was labeled as a narcissist and denied his degree.    After the unfortunate event, he was recognized in the art world, and with his partner, and now wife, he began to explore and create. For him, art has to deal with philosophical and psychological. He chooses his medium because it gives him space and opportunity to experiment and put himself out there. Ignoring the traditional uptake that art should be pretty, he is more concerned about what his work communicates. Turk believes that true artwork must be questioned and examined, it must always be open to analysis. When he made his Pop installation in 1993, where he made a wax statue of himself, posing as Sid Vicious with the revolver in a manner Andy Warchol portrayed Elvis, he jumped over iconic symbols in order to question the icons and symbols people respect and admire.  Turk's idea is that art is about the artist, and that is the reason he is the subject of many of his works. After the concept behind his creations is presented and explained, it is obvious that he is more of the object of his art, and the theme is the idea of the identity. He shares a lot of theories about culture and philosophy and he analyzes every single thing he does. He does that in order to provide an explanation, to give more essence to his substance. Without theoretical knowledge artist's vision would be hollow and his creations shallow, so Turk tries to give the audience something to think about. In Sigmund Freud Museum in London in 2015, he set up an installation called Wittgenstein's Dream where a wax statue of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is holding an egg, insinuating the fallacies of Freud's theories about what is real and what is just an impression. Turk contemplates and speculates, and continues to grow as an artist and as a skeptic. The artist is represented by Hang-Up Gallery London and Cat Street Gallery.

Roe Ethridge,"An American postmodernist commercial and art photographer, Roe Ethridge is best known for exploring how pictures can be easily replicated and recombined to create new visual experiences. Drawing from his personal experience of the world, he captures the vivid and intimate details of his various locales within photography’s classic genres of portrait, landscape, and still life. Born in 1969 in Miami, FL, Ethridge lives and works in New York. He received a BFA in Photography at The College of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. His work has been shown extensively at institutions around the world, including MOMA/PS1 (2000), Barbican Center, London (2001), Carnegie Museum of Art (2002), Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2005), The Whitney Biennial (2008), Museum of Modern Art, New York (2010), Les Recontres D’Arles, France (2011). In 2011 he was shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize. His first major retrospective, curated Anne Pontégnie, was exhibited at Le Consortium in Dijon before traveling to Museum Leuven, Belgium in 2012. Gagosian Gallery’s first exhibition of Ethridge’s photographs took place in Los Angeles in 2006. Blurring the boundaries between commercial and artistic work, Ethridge creates painterly compositions with renewed meanings that are simultaneously generic and intimate. In his commercial work he uses his settings playfully as frames of reference that look at the fictional world of advertising from the inside out.",1752
Miaz Brothers,"The Miaz Brothers present a radical new take on portraiture. The Italian duo, who are indeed siblings, create large-format canvases using spray paint as it never has been before. The Antimatter Series, as their body of work is known, incorporates a diverse and refreshing range of subjects. It includes portraits of their friends, their dear departed (Ghosts), philosophers, fashionable female Japanese adolescents, and figures from the era of the English Restoration (Masters). Painting using spray-cans and restricted to a Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow colour-palette, the Miaz brothers display a profundity of technique rarely seen in painting. Commenting on the role of painting and also the ubiquity of the photographic image, the works are themselves situated almost above classification - too distanced from the paintbrush to be wholly considered conventional painting, yet certainly not informative enough to masquerade as photography. The brothers attended the Art School and European Institute of Design. Since childhood, the two have shared their lives collaborating with each other in work and. While they employ aerosol paints, the Miaz Brothers have never been street artists nor are they ever likely to start. ""We use it to represent the fact that we are composed of infinite particles in continuous evolution"", they say, ""Which change in tandem with the complex reality that surrounds us."" The spray paint produces the blurred effect that defines the duo's work: ""dematerialising the lines, we gain a substantial indetermination of the picture. This skips any immediate reaction and provokes the viewer to use mnemonic associations instead for their own personal visual information encoding."" While possessing multi-disciplinary skills, the brothers are inclined towards portrait painting as it in itself ""prompts questions about the transitory nature of existence"". Ultimately though, the Antimatter Series is a stunning selection of artworks. The brothers currently live and work in Valencia, Spain.",1753
Alec Soth,"Alec Soth is an American photographer from Minnesota and a member of the prestigious Magnum cooperative. His style is based on the American style of photography which is distinguished by the on the road philosophy of taking photos. The pioneers of this tradition, such as Walker Evans, Robert Frank, and Stephen Shore, are just some great photographers by whom Alec Soth was inspired. What makes his work unique is that he discovered this style on his own by randomly wandering around finding things, instead of reading about it. Because of this, his creativity came directly from him, instead of from the inspiration by the photographers before him.  When Huckleberry Finn decided to travel the great river Mississippi, there wasn’t a clear goal in his head. He was traveling for the sake of traveling. Similar stories lie behind the photographer's work. But, instead of being fiction, the photographer's work is chronicled by himself, instead of by a writer. It seems as if traveling and recording the experience is deeply rooted in American tradition. Songs are sung, books were written, and lastly, photographs are taken by the likes of Alec Soth. From West to East, every inch of unique and beautiful American heritage has been documented in one way or another. When speaking about Soth and different art forms that have documented this American desire, it can’t go without mentioning another important element of his style of photography. Although it is photography, his work has a strong cinematic feel, as if any moment the images will start to move and tell the story to which this single image is introducing. Encompassing most Midwestern part of United States, Soth has created large-scale American projects through which he documented the outcasts, dreamers, strangers, and everyday people. He has photographed around the entire continent of America, but somehow the part that attracted him the most was the part most of the people just fly over when trying to get from one side to the other. Although his work is mostly compared with the work of Walker Evans and Stephen Shore, his true first inspiration came from discovering Diane Arbus and her work.[1] As Arbus was known for photographing marginalized people such as dwarfs, giants, transgender, etc, it inspired Soth to take his chance by traveling and documented the great American unknown. Parts of the America that are full of life, but the majority either doesn’t go there or simply doesn’t notice the beauty found on the edge of the society.   While traveling the Mississippi river, Soth created and self-printed a book title Sleeping by the Mississippi. This brought attention to his work and in 2004 his image title Charles was picked for the poster of 2004 Whitney Biennial.Soth admitted he was very shy as a child and this shyness reflects in his work. The thing is, it doesn’t reflect in a negative way, something people would initially think, but rather in a creative and cooperative fashion. He often feels nervous while photographing unknown people he meets, but as Soth himself said: My own awkwardness comforts people, I think. It’s part of the exchange. Another too early brought presumption would be this exchange is based on giving attention to the marginalized people for a photograph, but the exchange runs on a much deeper and personal level. It is fueled by a positive need to document things which are often ignored. These people already have the beauty of their own and people like Soth play the role of the medium to bring this beauty to a wider audience. The empathy is the main ingredient of his work and although he’s a member of Magnum, his work isn’t pure street photography. Nevertheless, it shares the values by connecting not just with the people found on the streets, but outside them as well.   When saying on-the-road-photography, we cannot but think it’s an unplanned style of photography. For most of part, it’s true as people like Soth can’t know what they will experience. But, they can imagine what they would like to experience as a sort of a goal. This goes for Soth who would often have notes taped to the steering wheel of pictures he would like to take. One of the lists for the Sleeping By Mississippi project stated: pilots, amateur paintings, mattresses, Memphis, border collies, house boats, unusually tall people, museum guards, snow, lent, other photographers, Duluth, sleeping children, neighborhood bars, icehouses, prostitutes, Bogota, supermarket cashiers, model airplanes, sheep, sedans, the quad cities, swimming pools, suitcases, and the Mississippi river. Having an idea of what can be found on his list is important as it’s the point that distinguishes him from before mentioned inspiration, Diane Arbus. Unlike her who focused solely on rejected part of society, Soth is interested in everything and nothing. More specifically, he doesn’t ignore one extreme for the sake of the other. His photo wishes might seem random, but in reality, they are all created from a mind untainted by the outside world of prejudice. Through them, Soth wants to create one main story where each picture leads to another. This is yet another aspect which draws the line towards the similarity with cinematography - creating a story with its beginning and the end. His lists can include anything, from things as common as a tent to unusual things most people would ignore, such as mushroom hunters. It’s unpredictable, which is the reason why Soth’s work keeps its freshness even after many years of work.[2] When photographing people he has a simple procedure. He’ll always ask them for permission and he’ll wait for the model to get comfortable. This way, Soth enters the unique world of an individual where he becomes able to document the habits and rituals of each person. Interestingly, Soth brought this ability to the point where it’s no longer mandatory for the person to actually be in the shot, a landscape of person’s house or a close up of his/hers belongings is enough.   Sleeping With Mississippi was published in 2004 and the following book was Niagara from 2006. Niagara followed a similar pattern as the previous one, documenting the outskirts where the civilization and wilderness collide and more importantly, people who are the main part of this mixture. One of the most known photographs from this book is of a bride sitting outside a small building, most likely a local motel. This picture was taken during his trip to Niagara Falls where he made an arrangement with a local wedding chapel to photograph couples as soon as they got married. Interestingly, some of the newlyweds photographed in this period were nude. Expanding his view on life outside photography, Alec Soth managed to do in a 4 year period when he created Broken Manual alongside Lester B. Morrison. This book, as the title says, is a manual for people who are looking to somehow get away from their own lives and creating a new one. Unlike his previous work, here he gave priority to unique types of people such as monks, survivalists, and escapees. His photography might come from curiosity filled with shyness, but they are the most sure-footed documentation of entire generations that either lived or are living in the United States.[3] American curator John Szarkowski said this about his work: It isn’t what a picture is of, it is what it is about. This short sentence could possibly be the best description of his work. After a couple of more books, Soth created his own book publishing house, Little Brown Mushroom in 2010. It made it easier for him to publish his own pictures and to utilize the time as much as possible, but it also opened a new possibility, to publish books of like-minded people.   Besides taking photographs of random people, Soth also photographed celebrities and their homes, most notably Johnny Cash and his boyhood home in Kingsland, Arkansas. A small cottage with a tree triple its size and a large field in front, it summarized everything about the childhood of the Man In Black. Interestingly, it summarized the life before the fame, something that probably wasn’t done unplanned.There are a couple of lines Alec Soth and his work walks. One is the line between romance and cold reality, while the other is between documentary photography and photography as a fine art. Somehow, Soth manages to combine all these elements into one meaningful whole. In reality, anybody can walk these lines and encompass them into their work, but those fine little details that make a piece of art great, only artists such as Soth have. Although he traveled countless times on the relation USA-UK, two trips can be said to be most important. One was in 2015 when he went to the UK to promote his then latest book titled Gathered Leaves, and the second trip happened around 5 years earlier. During this trip, Soth was allowed for a work visa although he didn’t apply for one. The visa was given under presumption if he was caught photographing without one he would be put in prison for as much as two years. Because of this, during this trip, he hired his young daughter to take pictures while staying in Brighton.   The photographer's work has been featured in countless solo and group exhibitions. Besides in the UK, Gathered Leaves exhibition was stationed also in the Finnish Museum of Photography in Helsinki and many other places. It was the biggest Soth's exhibition to date as it brought together four of his best-known works: Sleeping by the Mississippi, Niagara, and Songbook. Another recent exhibition titled Hypnagogia showed yet an entirely different part of his work. 30 good images from 20-year of exploration time were featured. The element connecting these 30 specific images was the feeling of being neither awake nor asleep. These photographs presented this mid-state through people and landscapes. An exhibition similar to Gathered Leaves was featured in Walker Art Center titled From Here To There, Alec Soth’s America. The title couldn’t have been more appropriate as it was a comprehensive exhibition of his entire work until 2010.Besides before mentioned Sleeping by the Mississippi (2004), Niagara (2006), Broken Manual (2010), and Gathered Leaves (2015), Alec Soth also self-published Fashion Magazine (2007), Dog Days, Bogota (2007), and The Last Days of W (2008).   Alec Soth’s first big prize was in 2003 when he was handed Santa Fe Prize for Photography and also received a fellowship from the McKnight and Jerome Foundations. His work is both in major public and private collections. Most renowned places that hold Soth’s work are San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Art Houston, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and the Walker Art Center.Soth has photographed for The New York Times Magazine, Fortune and Newsweek, in 2004 was nominated and in 2008 accepted into Magnum Photos.

Frank Auerbach,"Born in Berlin, Frank Auerbach is a British painter widely known as a genius of painting art and one of the most influential painters today. Auerbach is best known for his figurative pieces through which he was able to establish himself as a seasoned creative. Interestingly, primary two subjects of his work are his wife Julia (full name Juliet Yardley Mills) who's referenced in the paintings under her initials, J.Y.M. and his friend and lover Estella Olive West, whose initials he also used (E.O.W.). Also known for leading a modest life, this modesty Auerbach transferred on his creations through scenery found near his studio in Camden, London. Nevertheless, his work is rich in imagination and depth which overflows the entire canvas in each of Auerbach’s canvases.  When Frank was 7 years old his parents sent him to England in order to escape Nazi regime in 1939. There he got his education through the Kindertransport Programme, a school organized specially for war refugees. Already at young age, Auerbach showed a huge talent for art, which was discovered by the writer Iris Origo. Origo enabled Auerbach to study at St. Marin’s School of Art and later at the Royal College of Art. Besides having impressing talents in expressionistic painting, Frank also had a gift for acting. At the age of 17, he got his first part in Peter Ustinov’s House of Regrets where another event vital for Auerbach’s painting career happened. It was here that he met Estella Olive West (E.O.W.) who at that time was 32 years old. Stella was an amateur actress and a widow who had a boarding house in Earls Court. Soon she became his lover and muse which would last for the next 23 years, long after Auerbach would marry his second muse, Julia.[1] It was Stella who helped Frank to find his unique style of creating and reworking drawings. The main aspect of this style was thoroughness because of which he would spend countless days and nights finishing a single painting. This perfectionism reflected on Auerbach’s and Stella’s relationship which in return reflected on his artistic approach. Interestingly, the only thing he spent more on his paintings than his time, was the massive quantity of paint. Some of his work had so much paint layers, it was impossible to hang the artworks, thus they had to be displayed flat at many of his prominent exhibitions. Because of this, many critics wouldn’t approve his art and called it grotesque, obtrusive and self-indulgent. Similar aspect can be found in his drawings. He would insert multiple layers and erase to the point of going through several sheets of paper in an obsessive-compulsive manner. One of the drawings where this thickness can easily be seen is Head of Julia from 1960.   The dominance of monotone, pale colors in his early work is mostly due to lack of finance. Some years after Auerbach got an annuity of 1,500 pounds from the Beaux Arts which enabled to use a broader set of colors. Although often described as an expressionist, his pieces go far beyond the point of expressionism. Unlike many expressionist artists, Frank didn’t focus on connecting the visual with the spiritual, it can be discussed he did quite the opposite. It was largely due to this fact that Auerbach created a strong connection with his subjects. Although his primary goal was to resolve the life experience from his art, Auerbach found inspiration exactly in these elements. As he mentioned in an interview: If you pass something every day and it has a little character, it begins to intrigue you.[2] In other words, this quote is a testament to Auerbach and his passion. Anything, no matter the dose of intrigue, was enough to inspire Auerbach to paint. This highly emotional connection Auerbach cherished was the main reason for his often dissatisfaction with his work, which resulted in scraping and starting all over again. Thus, the number of layers which can be found in his art isn’t for the sake of art, but for the sake of the painter. This is also the reason for Auerbach having a small number of human subjects. The dissatisfaction made him turn back every time in order to try again. This can even be applied to his landscapes and the reason why he stayed at the same place for more than half a century. Besides taking the influence directly from experiencing people and the surrounding, his creativity is also under the new influence of acting and drama. There is yet another interesting phenomenon to his work. Although his paintings can be described as abstract and figurative, Frank was very much under the influence of famous classical artists such as Rembrandt, Titian, and Rubens. He even created his own versions of Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian and Samson and Delilah by Rubens. Frank’s art has its foundation in deep realism, no matter of the medium he used.   Besides being a prolific visual creator, Frank Auerbach also showed great talent for printmaking. Auerbach started printmaking while attending the Royal College of Art and he would often redraw figures on pieces of zinc alloy by creating scratches and injecting ink into them. After finishing this step, Auerbach would finish the printing process by laying and pressing a sheet of dampened paper over the alloy. Most of the prints have spoon marks on them, the tool he would use to apply the pressure. For Auerbach, the main motivation behind printmaking was the possibility of reconstructing and reformulating an existing work. By moving it from one medium to another, the artist was able to express himself through an existing piece of art. The rules Auerbach used in painting were applied in printmaking as well. Hard, continuous efforts until the final product was next to perfect. In his lifetime, Auerbach has made only two landscape prints and unlike all of his other landscapes, they don’t involve his home surrounding. Instead, these two prints were made during his trips to a house in Tretire Herefordshire. The lines seen on the screen are of the same scale as the plate. This created a strong feeling of layers in his prints as the quality was pretty much the same. When creating landscapes from his window at his home and studio in Camden, London, the British artist used any means necessary in order to get a satisfying image. He often set food for the local chickens at specific places, just so he could have them in the perfect position for his work.[3]   Besides Stella and Julia, Frank Auerbach also did portraits of many of his friends and artists, for instance Lucian Freud. In fact, his first double plate etching titled Six Etchings of Heads included these people. Here, the artist used a dart to draw as he grew accustomed to using anything that had a sharp end in his work, another element that proves the modesty he practiced. Later, he took a 10-year rest from etchings until he published Seven Portraits which also were of Auerbach’s acquaintances, but this time he used a screwdriver instead of a dart. It’s interesting to notice how the tool of choice affected his work. While the one where he used a dart had thinner lines, the one where he used a screwdriver vary in width.From 1994 to 2001, Frank mostly did prints of his wife Julia, which are now exhibited at the permanent collection of Rijksmuseum and Tate Gallery in London. The emotion he shared with her, Auerbach expressed in his art. Besides Julia, at the time he had another new subject, Ruth Bromberg. With Ruth, the artist further expanded his creativity, mainly in terms of something that could only be called zooming out on the subject. Besides the head, he also portrayed her figure and he started using a new wider array of linings through aquatint for the very first time. This enabled the artist to deepen the already achieved mastery. He started doing harsher linings while simultaneously keeping the elegance.   Frank Auerbach is one of the most important postwar painters. Not just because of his legacy, but because of the huge contribution he made in the form of artistic innovation. The deliberate restrictions Auerbach practiced, forced him to be creative even with the smallest of things. Not to be mistaken, these restrictions don’t apply to the quantity of material, but to the approach, Auerbach has been using through all these years. The talent created a painter, and the passionate restriction created an artist. Frank Auerbach declined knighthood in 2003 and currently is one of the most internationally collected living artists. Yet, due to his privacy concerns, he is not overly active in terms of his social life. After a focused retrospective exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in December 1978, Auerbach was chosen to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale where he won the Golden Lion for his collection, an award he shared with Sigmar Polke. In November of 2001, BBC 2 broadcasted Frank Auerbach: To the Studio, a film by Hannah Rothschild. The artist is represented by Marlborough Gallery.  References:  ",1755
Robert Ryman,"Robert Ryman was an American painter identified with the movements of monochrome painting, minimalism, and conceptual art. He is best known for abstract, white-on-white paintings. When Ryman, born in Nashville in 1930, Tennessee, arrived in New York in 1952 to study, his first ambition was jazz rather than art. He took a job as a guard at the Museum of Modern Art and worked there for seven years; during this time he became increasingly interested in the visual arts, and began painting. His development as a painter was not so much a linear process as a concentration on one theme: the pictorial complexity created through a reduced, extremely restricted visual vocabulary. By manipulating scale and texture in his work, Ryman created variations on the square format and the color white. His paintings evoke an awareness of the act of painting, namely by drawing attention to brushstrokes, surfaces, and materials, as well as to the edges of the image and the relationship between the painting and the wall it hangs upon. Ryman’s art has often been described as Minimalist or Conceptual, while he prefers to use the term realistic, aiming not to create illusions with paint but to investigate the concrete presentation of painterly materials. Ryman experimented with painting on canvas, linen, and steel, as well as with different painting materials, techniques, and with printmaking. It was not until the late 1960s that he began to exhibit regularly; he had his first solo show at Paul Bianchini's gallery in 1967, at the age of 36. His first solo museum exhibition was held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York in 1971. He held subsequent exhibitions at documenta 6 and 7 in Kassel, Germany, and at the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

Claude Lalanne,"Claude Lalanne, was a sculptor celebrated for her expressive and whimsical metal sculptures, furniture, and jewelry. Lalanne studied architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts and École des Arts Décoratifs. She involved herself in the artist community in Impasse Ronsin, Montparnasse, Paris and became friends with American artists Larry Rivers and Jimmy Metcalf who helped her develop the art of electro-plating. Although a successful artist in her own right, Lalanne was also known for her collaborations with her husband Francois-Xavier Lalanne. She had met him at a gallery in 1952, and the couple came to be collectively referred to as “Les Lalanne”. A series of commissions by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé, beginning in the mid-1960s, earned them widespread recognition. Several works designed by Claude for Yves Saint Laurent were featured as part of his estate sale at Christie’s in 2008, including a group of mirrors with bronze vegetal motifs, created between 1974 and 1985. While the era was a major exponent for Abstract, Conceptual, and Pop Art, Les Lalannes found inspiration in the traditional lines, forms, and textures present in nature. Claude was particularly drawn to plants and flowers, Francois-Xavier, to animals. The first exhibition of her work was held in 1964 at the Galerie Claude Bernard in Paris. Her pieces have since been incorporated into the collections of major institutions, such as the Cooper Hewitt, the National Design Museum in New York, and the Georges Pompidou Centre and Musée National d’Art Moderne in Paris.

Sascha Braunig,"Sascha Braunig, born in 1983, is a Canadian artist who combines vibrant color and a hypnotic style in her paintings and drawings. She holds a BFA from The Cooper Union, New York, and an MFA in painting from Yale University. Her work is mainly focusing on portraits, characterized by surrealistic approach and luminescent abstraction. Flaring with reflected color, they are iridescent beings whose very skin seems to be a source of psychic power. Foreground, background, and figure often merge, as if the subject is expanding into, yet also constrained by, the frame of the painting. In dream-like scenes, where repetition and patterning are foregrounded, Braunig’s figures emit an extrasensory glow.  She uses different shapes that are painted over the face, for example diamonds, circles, spheres, but the geometrical forms are not the main feature of her compositions. The compositions are full of undefined, abstract shapes, depersonalizing the subject matter. She embellishes mannequin heads with stripes, reflective materials, sequins and lights them dramatically. As a result, the figures turning to be masks of an unknown persona, with futuristic, scientific and experimental elements. Her work exists in the territory between portraiture and relic. Sascha Braunig has had numerous gallery and museum exhibitions, including at the New Museum of Contemporary Art and at the Baltimore Museum of Art. She currently lives and works in Portland, Maine, USA.   ",1758
Chanoir,"Chanoir is a moniker for Columbian-born artist Alberto Vejarano, working both in streets and in studio. He is best known for his easily recognized, eponymous cat character – Cha. Chanoir was born in Bogota, Columbia in 1976, and raised in France, where he graduated from the Fine Art of Paris at Jean-Michel Aberola studio in 2002. Paris was the place where Chanoir began his graffiti art.  Chanoir became known for his graffiti and especially for the iconic cat that in the mid-90s began to flood walls in different cities in Europe and Latin America. Considering that his dad is an artist, Chanoir has been surrounded by art world since his early years. When he was 20, in 1996, he took a spray can and created his first cat on the street. Raised in the 19 arrondissement of Paris, he started doing graffiti when this way of expression almost disappeared in his neighborhood. For a while Chanoir was the only street logo in his area. Educated at the prestigious Paris’ Ecole des Beaux Arts, he already had education, knowledge in the history of art, but that wasn’t enough thrill for him. The world of street art attracted him - magical interaction that happens between the passers-by and the work presented on the walls of their town. Chanoir sees the beauty in painting in the streets in that that anybody can create work there, without knowledge, just by instinct, from how they feel using a spray, how they feel about the street and about people.  For Chanoir, the artist must remain in place and keep its original purpose without mixing politics. Without media influences or references, he manages for his paintings to cause strong emotions among viewers. Chanoir describes his works as subtle blends of colors to appeal to the good mood - the viewer is immersed in a world strangely happy, serene and comforting, which often leads to the feeling of clean carefree childhood. Using his distinctive cat characters, he guides the various famous cartoons of a globalized culture, such as Mickey Mouse, Winnie, and Superman, and reinvents them through systematic metamorphosis of his own logo. His body of work feeds on his childhood memories and experiences, inspired by many different 1980’s cartoons he grew up with.  No hard feelings, the first solo exhibition in Miami by Chanoir, held in 2013, questions the basis of unnecessary suffering and tyranny of power undisturbed. The content for this exhibition is based on our experience as human beings, our fears, and emotions and how consciousness and society interferes and manipulates our reality. In Chanoir’s works shown at the No Hard Feelings exhibition, the chains symbolize powerlessness and stuffed animals symbolize the carnal and mortal condition of man. The use of these popular characters allows the viewer to feel identified with the subject. By torturing these inanimate beings there comes an inquiry on human instinct and why they feel satisfaction when others are tortured, killed and humiliated.  Chanoir is also one of the members of 1980 Crew. The 1980 Crew are based in Barcelona, one of the big capitals of street art and graffiti. Its members are RODRIGONE, MISTER, MALICIA, FLAN, KOAR, CHANOIR, TROTTER, and IBON – all of them belong to a generation who grew up watching television, and are inspired by the cartoons of the 1980s. Their artworks are full of color and imagination. They love to experiment with big murals in public places, mixing their own special sign language with comic-inspired characters. As a member of the 1980 collective, Chanoir designed a Halloween mural for Disney along the Champs Elysées Avenue.  Over time, his cats began to take on their own personalities and went on from the Parisian streets to become famous on the Barcelona graffiti scene. When Chanoir became extremely active within the Barca street art arena, an Erasmus grant enabled him to explore the street art culture through a documentary, titled Murs Libres. Realized and produced by Chanoir himself, the Murs Libres movie (Free Walls in translation) speaks about the golden years of Barcelona graffiti. Chanoir was commissioned by prestigious brands like Disney, Cacharel, and Samsung. His work has been shown in Paris, Barcelona, Bogota, Miami, San Juan, and Beijing.  Chanoir is currently living between Paris and Barcelona.",1759

Larry Poons,"The notable art practice of Larry Poons is marked with a continuous examination of the media of painting. The artist has extensively passed through various stages of experimentation and aesthetically flirted with different styles. The ongoing focus on the formal issues suggests the primary concern for the relations between pictorial elements within the canvas. The light and the color seem to be in the service of composition which is being perceived as a live organism.  A peculiar approach to dynamism and harmony is of great importance to the artist so the whole agenda is a plunge in the hidden realms of painterly experience.   Larry Poons was born in 1937 in New York. In 1955, he started attending the New England Conservatory of Music, and two years later transferred to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and also studied at the Art Students League of New York.  In 1963 Poons had his first solo exhibition at famed Green Gallery, and just two years after his work was included in MoMA’s celebrated exhibition, The Responsive Eye. In 1981 the MFA Boston organized an exhibition of his paintings from the 1970s. The work of Larry Poons is included in major museum and private collections throughout the United States and abroad.    Poons found himself in a period of flourishing avant-garde activity in New York’s slightly after the first wave of Abstract Expressionism. Namely, the artist moved to New York in 1958, at age 21, and soon met and befriended Barnett Newman, who’s work inspired him greatly. The other relevant person was curator Henry Geldzahler, who encouraged Poons to simplify his work and introduced him to the geometric abstractions of  Frank Stella. At this early stage, his works were mostly done in a geometric Op art style that drew ideas from both Bauhaus and Minimalist theory, while by the mid-sixties, he moved away from the optical, scientific aspect of his work and toward a more poetic and painterly direction.    After seeing the exhibition of  Jules Olitski at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1969, Poons realized that expanded artistic possibilities allowed for more unconventional processes, and that is how he appropriated the expressionistic drip style. These new horizons led the artist to explore surface effects of paint on canvas, so he began to pour, slosh, and drip paint onto the surface; first on the floor and later tacked up to the wall. The move to the wall proved integral, as there he could experiment with the effects of gravity as it pulled the paint down the canvas, producing a powerful directional layout. The use of long rolls of the canvas was in charge so that he would cut only after the paint had dried, that was reminiscent of the work of Jackson Pollock.   Despite the fact Poons didn’t finish the Music Conservatorium, he never quit music. Namely, he played guitar with The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music art band that featured prominent members of the New York proto-conceptual art and minimal art community in the early 1960s. The artist was deeply inspired by then rising musicians and composers such as LaMonte Young, Phil Glass, and Steve Reich. The other passion which triggered Larry Poons are vintage motorcycles. He was even given special awards from the American Historic Racing Motorcycle Association (AHRMA), including the 500 cc Hailwood Cup in 1998 and 2003, and the 2003 John & Ginny Demoisey Trophy for road racing couples, with his wife, painter Paula DeLuccia.    Although the work of Larry Poons is associated with Op Art, Hard-edge painting, Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction and Abstract Expressionism, during the course of years he has developed authentic art practice. Interestingly, the artist has taught at The Art Students League from 1966-1970 and since 1997 until present he teaches there.  The concise and focused activity of Larry Poons is abstract and allows a multitude of readings, yet his intense microcosm shows the artist’s immense energy and employment of astonishing rhythmic vitality.

Paul Gauguin,"Truly disappointed with Impressionism, claiming that the European painting had become imitative and deprived of symbolic depth, Paul Gauguin turned to the art of Africa and Asia in a pursuit for the primitive style. Leaving his wife and five children, he had worked for a short time on the Panama Canal, before sailed to tropical islands of Tahiti and Marquesas in French Polynesia. In the focus of his interests were young native girls who were his models and lovers. Inspired by the primitivism of this land, both physically and spiritually escaped from his heritage, Gauguin left the post-Renaissance postulates, paying no attention to perspective or gradations of colors and shadings. Distancing from Impressionism, his work is recognizable for his experimental use of color, semi-decorative approach and Synthetist style.     Born in Paris, his family soon after moved to Peru. His father was a journalist and after his death on the way to South America, at the age of seven, Gauguin returned to France with his mother. After he finished his formal education, he joined the French Navy and later worked as a stockbroker. Being a self-taught, painting was a hobby which during the time became his only interest. When one of his works was accepted in the Salon of 1876, he met Camille Pissarro who introduced him to other impressionists. Gauguin exhibited in Impressionists show held in 1881 and 1882, but it passed unnoticed.   Leaving his job of a stockbroker, he was fully devoted to his art. In 1888, he created one of his most impressive painting, Vision of the Sermon, depicting the biblical tale of Jacob wrestling with the angel. Afterward, follow the other Biblical stories, as The Yellow Christ, prominent representation of Crucifixion, familiar and often exploited theme. In that time, Gauguin shared his living and artistic space with Vincent Van Gogh, residing Van Gog’s yellow house in Arles. Their companionship lasted for nine weeks and after the serious fight, when his friend pulled out the razor blade, Gauguin had left. The two artists newer saw each other again.    Searching for the escape from artificial and conventional, frustrated by the lack of recognition, he left Europe in a quest for tropical paradise. He has settled among the natives, borrowing the elements and symbols from their culture. In 1893, he returned to France with the aim to show some of his new works. The critic was divided and he wasn’t able to sell much. In 1897, Gauguin created his masterpiece Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?, the painting which represents the culmination of his thoughts. Conceived to be read from right to left, this monumental piece represents three female figures which symbolize the questions in the title, depicting the human life cycle.    In 1901, Paul Gauguin moved to the Marquesas Island. Experiencing several heart attacks, his health was getting worse because his advanced case of syphilis. In that time, he painted landscapes, still lifes and figure studies, avoiding the themes of lost paradise. He died suddenly on May 8, 1903, alone and nearly out of money, in his isolated cottage in Hiva Oa on the Marquesas Islands. After his death, his art started to receive great acclaim, probably thanks to Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse who stated interest and affection to his work. Two posthumous retrospective exhibitions held in Paris in 1903 and 1906 had a stunning influence on the French avant-garde. His legacy is of tremendous importance and today, his paintings reach the prices of tens of millions US dollars in the auctions.    ",1770
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,"A master of printmaking, posters and lithograph drawing, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was a French artist who invented and applied so many innovations to the world of art that it’s laborious work to just name them all. Gathering his creative influences from the works of the Impressionist Edgar Degas and the Japanese styles, Toulouse-Lautrec is credited for imbuing marginalized populations through his artworks. Unfortunately, Henri was also quite a frail man, suffering numerous chronical ailments throughout his life, illnesses that ultimately led to his demise and stopped him from impacting the history of art even further than he did.  Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa was born into the aristocracy on November 24, 1864, in Albi, a large commune in France. His parents Adèle and Alphonse were quite wealthy, but there was a terrible rumor lingering around the household of Toulouse-Lautrec - it has been said that Adèle and Alphonse were actually first cousins and that they were descended from previous instances of family inbreeding. Since Henri and many of his relatives were suffering from various chronical infections and physical ailments, many were convinced that the rumors are quite accurate. With such fragile physical condition, little Henri fractured his femur during his early teen years, suffering a condition that had a massive impact on his height as Toulouse-Lautrec never grew over 4 1/2 feet whilst his torso was quite nonproportional with his legs. All of that resulted with a handicap - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's was never able to walk without the use of a cane. Furthermore, he was forced to endure massively painful toothaches and mild facial deformities that were never fully healed. Some of the numerous experts that investigated the early life of this artist even went as far as to claim Henri suffered from pycnodysostosis, but many specialists have questioned this and that theory was never truly accepted. It's quite striking how all of the troubled members of Toulouse-Lautrec family found their comfort and solace in one activity - creating art. Henri personally made a choice to take up sketching from an early age prior to adolescence and the hobby slowly built up into a full painting craft as the young artist had a lot of spare time on his hands due to long periods of recuperation from health issues. Toulouse-Lautrec attended the Lycée Fontanes in Paris for a short period of time in the early 1870s and later on studied under the wings of fellow artists René Princeton and John Lewis Brown. These two painters focused most of their creative efforts towards exploring the boundaries of animal portraiture and that naturally extended down to the ideas of the pupil they shared - this heavily influenced some of Toulouse-Lautrec’s sensibilities later in his career. When Henri decided art was something he would enjoy pursuing on a professional level, the young painter sought further knowledge at the workshops of Léon Bonnat and Fernand Cormon during the years of 1882 and 1883, respectfully.  During the year of 1884, Toulouse-Lautrec moved to the Montmartre section of Paris, an area that was well known for its bohemian lifestyle which included exciting musical performances, numerous bars and the most popular brothels. During that period, Henri was expressing his artistic tendencies by creating pieces to accompany the music shows of singer/composer Bruant, a man that was also an owner of a prestigious cabaret where Toulouse-Lautrec was able to showcase his pieces. This time was quite essential for the development of a young aspiring artist because it allowed him to see from the get-go how it is to work for a client and how difficult it can be when you are trying to promote yourself in a compatible game such as the art scene of the late 19th century. Slowly progressing and tirelessly evolving, Toulouse-Lautrec built a stellar reputation for himself by depicting regular Montmartre denizens and celebrities. He worked with some of the most valuable and important individuals Paris had to offer, with the list of his subjects being topped by such names as Yvette Guilbert, Jane Avril and Loïe Fuller. Soon enough, residents of the Montmartre boulevard were literally lining up in order to get a chance of model for Henri - to be depicted by Toulouse-Lautrec was soon a sign of prestige and a hint that you are a popular and prosperous person. Needless to say, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec loved every minute of it as this was a whole new world to explore, not to mention how radically different it was when compared to the isolated lifestyle he was used to. Toulouse-Lautrec did not experiment that much with the material he used as much as he did with the ways of depicting same subjects in different ways. He mostly worked on canvas when he was painting ordered pieces of portraiture for his clients, but what separated him from the rest of the pack was the fact Henri did not frown upon the newly popularized medium of posters. Furthermore, Toulouse-Lautrec embraced the new method and decided to devote much artistic energy towards it, seeing the poster’s potential hidden, quite literally, in plain sight. Soon, people started to identify the process of making posters with Henri, which in return made him extremely popular and highly sought after, as well as making him the poster-boy of the entire new medium. Furthermore, Toulouse-Lautrec became famous for his unique style that was unlike anything the audience has ever seen prior to Henri’s arrival to the French capital. In an attempt to somehow locate the roots of this visual artist’s methods and style, many experts agreed that Toulouse-Lautrec found much incentive and influence inside the works of Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock printmakers which served as a limitless source of inspiration for the young artist. Henri was also heavily guided by the concepts of Edgar Degas, a fellow artist that also lived in the Montmartre section of Paris and was Toulouse-Lautrec’s close neighbor for a short period of time.    Over time, Henri developed an affinity of portraying damsels over gentlemen. This has often been attributed to simple sexual urge, but it seems as Toulouse-Lautrec found females to be more aesthetically diverse and more chelanging to portray. Some of the most well-known works this artist ever authored are The Englishman at the Moulin Rouge and the paintings At the Moulin Rouge - pieces in which Henri often portrayed himself amidst the masses, enjoying the view or a tasty beverage. Another popular painting of Toulouse-Lautrec is Rousse, a genius composition of a half-bare woman sitting in a café. As opposed to many of his contemporaries, French art critics at the time have regularly pointed out that Henri Toulouse-Lautrec had an unusual focal point and that it could be found somewhere at the crossroads of humor and realistic representation. He had a masterfull skill of eschewing fantasy to accurately reflect the circumstances surrounding the people he painted, many of which became his close friends afterward. Henri is also praised for being one of the first artists to ever depict workers of the sex industry without relying solely on erotic objectification. This revolutionary concept was seen in Toulouse-Lautrec’s famed 1896 brothel series of prints, Elles, as well as in the 1897 painting Woman Before a Mirror. In this remarkable piece, Henri presents her neither as a moralizing symbol nor a romantic heroine, but rather as a flesh-and-blood woman as capable of joy or sadness as anyone else. Through that sort of depicting, Toulouse-Lautrec showed both directness and honesty that are a true indicator of his love towards women.    Although he loved presenting himself as a witty, fun man about town, the truth was that Toulouse-Lautrec suffered greatly due to his physical ailments that were bothering him every single day of his life. One should not forget the circumstances of Henri’s childhood as well, as the rumors that were circulating around his household have definitely left him with a life-long trauma. Furthermore, his father never accepted his son’s decision to pursue a career of a professional artist, believing  Henri was supposed to be a worthy heir of both the family estate and the business that made them prosperous. At the peak of his career when he was truly accepted and appreciated by the public, Toulouse-Lautrec was forced to struggle with the new illness as he had contracted syphilis, a sickness that did nothing but further impact already bad health. In order to somehow go through the day, Henri turned to alcohol that did a good job of dealing with pain and letting him sleep - however, the artist ultimately  drunk himself into oblivion. He suffered a nervous breakdown in the year of 1899 after his mother, whom he was extremely close to, decided to leave Paris and abandon her son in the process. Consequently, Toulouse-Lautrec had to be hospitalized and was  committed to a sanitarium for several months. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec died on September 9, 1901, at the Château Malromé in Saint-André-du-Bois. He was only 36 years of age.    With a sad life story that is one of the rare careers capable of rivaling the circumstances of Vincent van Gogh, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is a true example of a crying clown with a sadness that couldn’t be fixed. Always presenting himself as a happy and satisfied person, he channeled his rage and melancholy through his art. Henri left behind him more than 700 canvas paintings, 350 prints and posters, as well as over 5,000 drawings. With so much artwork under his belt, Toulouse-Lautrec is a seminal pioneer to a number of movements, heavily influencing the way artists used to think. Many experts have connected Henri with the 20th-century phenomenon called Pop-art, claiming Toulouse-Lautrec was an early forerunner to later icons like Andy Warhol. This may very well be the most impressive aspect of Henri’s art - it has actually influenced movements that emerged almost a hundred years after it was created. An impressive feat not many can claim they have in their artistic arsenal.

Man Ray,"Emmanuel Radnitzky, by far better known by his iconic pseudonym of Man Ray, was an American artist whose innovative work established him as the leading figure behind the concepts of Dada and Surrealism, as well as for the rest of the early avant-garde art. Heavily influenced by the artworks of European authors such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Radnitzky was one of the few American artists to truly be accepted as the leading source of creative ideas on the Old Continent. Among his numerous contributions to the world of art, Man Ray's greatest achievement was the way he was able to manipulate the medium of photography by introducing the artistic potentials of different processes, such as solarization and rayographs (a special eponym for his photograms). Emmanuel Radnitzky once famously stated that he does not photograph nature, but his own visions - this was the main driving force behind all of art Man Ray ever created.  During his career as an artist, Man Ray worked hard at not allowing many details of his early life or family background to become open knowledge to the public. Why this was the case remains anyone's guess, but it was probably due to Radnitzky's desire to remain as mysterious as possible and allow his art to do most of the talking. He even went as far as saying that he had no name other than Man Ray, refusing to be called by the name found on his birth certificate. However, as he became increasingly more famous and admired by the contemporaries, many details of his private life leaked to the public. Man Ray was born as Emmanuel Radnitzky in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the year of 1890. His father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home, often depending on the help of his children to get the job done on time. Emmanuel had a brother and two sisters, where the youngest was born in 1897, shortly after the entire Radnitzky settled in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn, New York City. During the early portion of the year 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray as a reaction to the ethnic discrimination and antisemitism prevalent at the time. Additionally, Emmanuel altered his own first name into Man (a shorter variation of his childhood nickname of Manny) and gradually began to use Man Ray as his combined single name.  From an early point in his life, Man Ray wished to disassociate himself from his family background as much as possible, but the tailoring business left an enduring mark on his art. Mannequins, flat irons, sewing machines, needles, pins, threads, swatches of fabric and other items related to tailoring appear in almost every medium of his work. Some art historians have even gone as far as claiming that there are technical similarities between tailoring and Ray's collage/painting methods. Radnitzky's education at the Brooklyn's Boys' High School from 1904 to 1909 provided him with a solid grounding in drafting and other basic art techniques, setting up a fine understanding of art practices that served the author exceptionally well in the long run. As an addition to his classes, Ray also educated himself with frequent visits to the local New York art museums, where he studied the works of the Old Masters. Upon graduation, Man was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as a painter believing that this more conventional form of visual arts was much more suitable to his talents. His parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue such a goal, but they eventually agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his studio. From that point forward, Young Ray worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter[1], earning money as a commercial artist and a technical illustrator at several Manhattan companies.   Man Ray's early career artworks were mostly paintings and drawings created in a 19th-century style-inspired manner.[2] However, this changed radically when he started exploring the contemporary avant-garde art of Europe, a door that was opened by the stories and works of Alfred Stieglitz and the ideas of the Ashcan School. Although he was still not able to integrate these avant-garde trends into his own work, Man Ray enrolled in the Ferrer School in the autumn of 1912 and began a period of intense and rapid artistic development. He started briefly experimenting with cubistic ideas popular at the time, but after Ray befriended Marcel Duchamp, he started preferring more static compositions. In 1913, he met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur). Ray's first proto-Dada object was an assemblage titled as Self-Portrait[4] and was exhibited in the year of 1916. Man produced his first significant photographs in 1918, starting what many experts describe as his most important chapter as far as artistic practices are concerned. Ray soon became an integral part of the radical anti-art movement known as Dadaism that emerged from Zurich, regularly producing objects and developing unique mechanical methods of making images[5]. Of course, he was a huge part of the work created by Duchamp too as the two remained close friends for the remainder of their lives. They also accepted Francis Picabia in their close circle and all of them were connected by their experimental, entertaining and innovative art.   In the July of the year 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, France.[6] He settled in the famous Montparnasse quarter favored by many notable artists at the time. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Kiki de Montparnasse (Alice Prin), an artists' model and a celebrated character within Paris' bohemian circles. She subsequently became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images and starred in a few of his experimental films. For the next 20 years in Montparnasse, Man Ray was a distinguished photographer. He was a crucial part of the Surrealistic movement and was proudly featured as a part of the first Surrealist exhibition with Jean Arp, Max Ernst, André Masson, Joan Miró and Pablo Picasso at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. About four years later, Man began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer Lee Miller - a relationship that provided Ray with an opportunity to reinvent the photographic technique of solarization[7]. In 1934, surrealist artist Méret Oppenheim, known primarily for her fur-covered feministic art, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a printing press. Unfortunately, the artist was forced to return from Paris to the United States due to the events that led to the Second World War. He lived in Los Angeles, California, from 1940 to 1951 where he focused his creative energy on painting. After the horrors of the war were through, Man Ray returned to Paris and spent the rest of his life in the City of Light, creating art, writing theories and attending cultural events.[8] He died on the 18th of November in the year of 1976 from complications following a dire lung infection.    Man Ray's photographic artworks are often considered to be his most profound achievement, particularly his portraits pieces, fashion photographs and technical experiments with the medium that left a long lasting mark on all of the 20th-century art. However, despite this sounding very unrealistic, there is one other contribution of Emmanuel Radnitzky that by far exceeds the influence of rayographs and other similar projects. It was the ability of Man Ray to think outside the box, to not be confined by any conventional limitations set by the society, that allowed this artist to introduce some of the most important avant-garde concepts ever invented. By doing so, he set the big percentage of the stage for the remainder of the 20th century art, a time that will prove to be the most radically different from any other point in history before it - and if you start investigating any given movement of the last century, almost every conceptual road will somehow take you back to the ideas of Man Ray.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir,"Celebrated as one of the most popular French Impressionist artists, Pierre-Auguste Renoir was famed for his nudes and images of lavish Parisian modernity and leisure. Still, his art was more complex and thoughtful and besides being a skillful colorist with a keen eye for capturing the moment of light and shadow, thanks to exploring the Renaissance painting, his mature works are characterized by integration of line and composition. Working alongside Claude Monet, Renoir was a key person and one of the leaders of Impressionism, although unlike theirs, his paintings had conspicuous human element that set him apart. He was also only one that noticed the limitations of the expression based just on optical sensations and light effects, asserting the necessity of underlying structure and composition in modern painting. His theories were particularly important and widely incorporated into the major later movements as Fauvism and Cubism. Regarded as the master of facial expressions, his early works features pleasant, light themes of everyday life conveyed with the use of his distinctive technique of broken brush strokes of bright colors that portray the light and movement of the subject, reflecting his enjoyment of painting figures, particularly of women. Creating structural and monumental vivid paintings, Renoir bridged the gap between early colorists like Raphael, Rubens, Watteau and Delacroix and 20th-century great minds Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.   Renoir was born in 1841, in Limoges, French city in the central west area, known as the center of porcelain production in 19th-century. It was natural path that young artist took his first job as a painter in one of the factories. Growing up in a working-class family, as the son of tailor and sewer, he had deft hands, inheriting the talent for the detail and decoration that distinguished him among the other employers and draw the attention of wealthy patrons for whom he started to create different decorations. This early success encouraged him to leave the job and devote himself to fine art painting. He began with the visits to Louvre where he studied the French Rococo masters, Jean-Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honore Fragonard, Francois Boucher and Romantic painter Eugene Delacroix. He noticed the similarities in their brushstrokes and handling of paint, but also the departure from the classical norms by giving priority to color and movement instead of form. Entering the studio of a Swiss academic painter Charles Gleyre, Renoir directed his future career, due to the acquaintance with Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley and Frederic Bazille who became his close friends and future Impressionist colleagues. They often visited the forest of Fontainebleau to paint in plain air. Still, unlike his friends, Renoir always preferred work in studio and more traditional approach based on the style of the masters he admired. His friend Jules le Coeur owned the house in the southern border of the forest and, during the time, the artist accepted Fontainebleau as a favorite painting place, especially after 1865, when he was here introduced to Lise Trehot who became his lover and model for numerous portraits. One of these paintings, Lise with a Parasol, was received at the Salon of 1868. Familiar with the Salon’s standards, this portrait was created in a conventional manner in a combination of soft lines and clear coloration with the strict naturalism that evoked great Realist painter Gustave Courbet. Decisive for the further course of art history, the summer of 1989 was the time when Renoir and Monet laid the foundation of the style that would be later known as Impressionism. Two colleagues spent two months painting at La Grenouillere, a lakeside boating resort near the Paris. The indication of new approach was their use of broad brushstrokes with the aim to capture momentary scenes and natural movement of water surface with the reflection of light on it.   After the Franco-Prussian War in which he fought in and the occupation of the French Commune in 1871, everything changed for Renoir. Also, his 10-year friendship with le Coeur ended and he lost his favorite place for painting and source of patronage. He was in a situation when he had to choose whether buying a paint or paying a model. The Salon rejected his paintings, but he insisted on submitting work until 1873, believing that was the only way to achieve success. According to some of his writings, he thought that collectors were not capable of liking a painter who didn’t have the backing of the Salon. Still, he decided to join his friends Monet, Sisley, and Pissarro in their plans for the organization of the independent exhibition of their works, deprived of the strict and outdated propositions of the Salon’s jury. The first Impressionists exhibition was held on April 15, 1874, and although it didn’t meet critical acclaim, Renoir sold few paintings and attracted the attention of the collector Victor Chocquet who became his financial supporter during this period. Hoping to secure his income for a longer period, he decided to display mostly portraits at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, but next year he showed a more diverse range of themes and among these paintings were distinguished Dance at Le Moulin Galette and The Swing. Renoir chose not to exhibit at fourth and fifth Impressionist exhibition and instead submitted again to the Salon which now accepted his work and thanks to success of Mme Charpentier and her Children (1878), he became widely accepted and fashionable painter.   As he later wrote to the art dealer Ambroise Vollard, by the early 1880’s, he felt that he had ""reached the end of Impressionism and could neither paint or draw."" This feeling encouraged him to move toward more Classical ideas of composition and modeling. He decided to take a trip to Italy and before he left, he produced iconic Luncheon of the Boating Party (1880-1881) that already showed his technical change toward greater composition unity. His mature work no longer focused on expressing the movement and light but got closer to the coloring of Rococo and late Renaissance. Further inspired by his trip to Italy and later Spain, and England, Renoir drastically changed his approach. He even visited Algeria, following the steps of Eugene Delacroix and Madrid with the aim to study Diego Velazquez and Francisco Goya. In Italy, he admired Titian’s and Raphael’s masterpieces and met composer Richard Wagner at his home in Palermo where he painted his portrait in only half an hour. Summer 1883 which he spent on one island in the English Channel painting landscapes with beaches, cliffs, and bays, was a very productive considering the fact that re managed to produce fifteen paintings for little more than a month. When he returned to France, Renoir married Aline Victorine Charigot who was a model for his Luncheon of the Boating Party and got three sons with her. Although having a problem with continually failing health, after the bicycle accident his right arm was affected by arthritis, rheumatism plagued his left eye, and by 1910, he was mostly relegated to a wheelchair, he continued to produce a considerable number of art pieces. Purchasing a home in Cagnes-sur-Mer in the south of France, appropriate climate helped him to feel some relief. Great art dealer of that period, Ambroise Vollard, became his important patron and trusted friend who proposed him, according to his physical limitations, to attempt sculpture introducing him to young sculptor Richard Guino who worked in clay. Renoir created several very successful sculptures.   La Grenouillere (1869) represents the popular leisure place during the summer days where young Renoir with his friend Monet often painted developing new theories and techniques that became the basis of the future Impressionism. Unlike his friend who was focused on effects of light, Renoir always paid more attention to a human figure and stability of the composition. La Loge (1874) was one of the paintings presented in the first Impressionist exhibition that celebrated Parisian modern life. Having a very important role in society, the theater was popular place especially for the middle class to see and be seen and this painting depicted exactly the moment when the woman lowered her opera glasses, allowing her face to be seen. Beside her is a man (Renoir’s brother) who leaned back in his seat exploring the upper balconies with his glasses. The artist’s keen eye is recognizable for masterful treatment of detail on their clothes and jewelry.   Dance at the Moulin de la Galette (1876) is among Renoir’s masterpieces. Typical Impressionist scene depicts one moment of everyday life in the fashionable part of the city, near Montmartre where the middle-class people gathering for dancing, drinking, and dining. This unusual monumental piece (4 x 6 feet) reflects his extraordinary sense for the detail, capturing the scene with sheer quantity of people who do different things, conjoined under the flickering sunlight and parts of shade from the treetops above. Luncheon of the Boating Party (1881) represents more intimate scene with the number of his close friends, and future wife Aline Charigot. Looking beyond individual portraits, this painting is a beginning of his distancing from the Impressionism. Creating a scene less crowded with people but more full of light, shadow, and color, Renoir was getting closer to the Classic ideals of monumental and structural painting. The Umbrellas (1881) is a fine example of his use of underlying structure that he introduced into the Impressionist visual language. It represents the basis for the later movements, like Post-Impressionism and Cubism that adopted and developed Renoir’s approach to form.  Experimentation with color and light is joined with stronger line and emphasized geometric forms hidden in the background. The Large Bathers (1884-1887) evokes Ruben’s approach to the High Renaissance techniques. Renoir worked three years on this painting, making numerous preparatory drawings and sketches. Skillfully merging timelessness of Classical style with modern modes of painting, the artist moved away from the smaller, in the moment captured images of Impressionism. Portrait of Ambroise Vollard (1908) represents the celebration of their friendship. Besides revealing the artist’s considerable possibilities as a portraitist it shows his characteristic structure, coloration and impressionistic application of paint. Vollard was so great supporter and admirer of Renoir’s art that he published his biography in 1925.   His illness developed numerous deformities in his hands, forcing him to change his painting technique. Paralyzed fingers and bandages on his hands required and assistant to place the brush. Last twenty years of his life, he created with limited mobility using moving canvas and picture roll. In the winter of 1919, Renoir suffered heart attack and shortly after died in his family home in Cagnes-sur-Mer. He lived enough long to see his paintings in Louvre next to the masterpieces of the old masters he admired and studied earlier. While his Impressionist peers remained faithful to their convictions focusing on effects of light, he advanced his technique achieving almost sculptural quality of his later paintings. The next generation of artist including Pierre Bonnard, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Maurice Denis, all of them passionate collectors of Renoir’s work, were widely influenced by his distinctive combination of modernity and tradition.

Kurar,"Kurar is the pseudonym of a French artist whose work often addresses complex social issues such as post-urbanization, climate change, terrorism, and violence in local and global terms. In his practice, the artist highlights the important ideas and details by utilizing contrast, mainly between gray, black and fluorescent colors to make the subject and messages of the piece come out intensely. His witty and clever artworks have been included in numerous individual and collective shows worldwide.   Born in 1983 in France’s city Clermont-Ferrand, Kurar started to have a genuine interest in graffiti in the early 1990s, at a time when we couldn’t have talked about a street art scene, in France or anywhere else. There was no art market as we know it today nor any street artist’s exhibitions. It was all about the passion that the artists shared with friends. Kurar used to paint in brownfield sites for the space that allowed him to realize wall frescoes. Although he is today best known for his stencil art, the mysterious creative did not immediately start painting with stencils. At first, Kurar worked on 3D lettering, but over the years, he developed his distinctive stenciling techniques in order to express more concrete ideas in a different format.   Who is Kurar? This seems to be the commonly asked question for those who encounter his pieces for the first time. He chose his alias while he was playing with the word ""Curare"", describing a very poisonous substance extracted from a South American plant formally used by indigenous people to paralyze their target. Even though he didn’t choose that word based only on its meaning, he found it very coherent with his artistic approach. Working on the lettering, the artist modified the word “Curare” into ""Kurar"" as the letters were more graphical and interesting, so he could create a new dynamic by playing with them.   Over the years, Kurar has developed his stencil techniques in order to express more complex ideas restructured in a more logical and readable format. He uses stencils to express his opinion of the world around us, especially focusing on economic, political and social problems with an emphasis on the evolution of our societies through the decades. Believing that art is a testimony of our history, of our traditions and of our values, Kurar portrays these dysfunctions within a global and artistic approach. He fearlessly tackles some sensitive issues that the world deals with today, and he does it with a pinch of humor and in the manner of an effective wake-up call to our culture and society.    The main subjects in Kurar’s pieces are children often surrounded by weapon, chains, or symbols of modern age like computers, or shopping bags. He brilliantly uses the symbol of innocence to contrast with the satirical and provocative aspect of these representations and, simultaneously, to emphasize the message and its effects like in his mural entitled And the Light is... (also known as A Girl & TV) painted in Berlin, Germany for Urban Nation group show. Featuring a girl captivated by interesting content on television, we see both the negative and critical side of the piece as well as the artist’s sense of humor and his undoubted talent. And the Light is... (A Girl & TV) was included in Widewalls selection of top 100 murals, painted on the walls across the globe by the world’s leading street and urban artist, during the one hundred weeks starting from 2013 when the magazine was established.   The French graffiti artist seems to be quite fascinated with the phenomenon of television, and its effects on the audience’s behavior. His latest series of paintings, custom castings, objects, and installations revolves around the topic of TV and the way it is still an inescapable, ubiquitous factor of our everyday life. TV Rules Your Life was the title of one of his latest solo shows that was on view at Next Street Gallery in Paris in March 2016. His work was also included in numerous individual and collective shows in such countries as Spain, Singapore, Germany, and the United States.  In his oeuvre, the artist depicts his own vision of our current society and its issues. Delicate subjects such as war, religion, and consumer society are all portrayed with poetry, humor, and provocation. Kurar forces us to ask ourselves the question, what is our role in society and how we can make the world a better place. He challenges our expectations toward social, cultural, economic and environmental issues, and opens us up to new ideas.  The artist is represented by We Are Partners Gallery in Paris, Artemisia Gallery in New York City, and GCA Gallery in Nice.   All images courtesy of the artist",1782

Al Held,"American artist Al Held is a pioneer of hard-edged abstraction. His paintings embrace spatial illusion and explore the dimensions that go beyond the realm of the viewer's primary senses. For five decades, the artist created post-Abstract Expressionism works that feature hard-edged geometries of such precision that they almost defy categorization. Throughout his career experimented Held with different movements and styles, constantly striving to expanding his painterly practice and language. Today the artist's works are represented in collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tate Gallery in London, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Whitney Museum of American Art, the Kunsthaus Zürich, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, Kunstmuseum Basel and the Art Institute of Chicago.   Al Held ( born in 1928 in Brooklyn) served in the US Navy for two years before studying at the Art Students League of New York. Thanks to the GI scholarship, the artist traveled to Paris and studied under the tutorship of Ossip Zadkine. There he also became close friends with Joan Mitchell and Ellsworth Kelly. At Galerie Huit in 1952, Al Held had his first solo show. After returning to the US, he began refining Abstract Expressionist compositions. Influenced by mentors Franz Kline and Mark Rothko, he began utilizing expressive brushstrokes in order to create more textural paintings full of geometric forms and colors, such as his Alphabet series (1961–67). Again the artist changed his style and technique in the late 1960s when he began creating black and white paintings. This period void of bright colors was characterized by Al Held's exploration of dimensionality, as he began adding three-dimensional forms and the sense of deep space. Al Held said:   Influenced by the realist paintings and murals by Mexican socialist artist David Alfaro Siqueiros, Held became interested in large-scale works. He received several commissions, including the mural for NYC Subway's Lexington Avenue and Greek Garden in Met. The artist admired the polished surfaces of Renaissance art and strived to completely eliminate traces of gesture in his works throughout his career. In his later large-scale murals, he sanded down surfaces in order to achieve the same effect.   Held took part in several group exhibitions that were key for the Abstract Expressionism movement in America, including Post Painterly Abstraction (1964) at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and American Abstract Expressionists and Imagists at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. From 1962 to 1980 worked at Yale University as an associate professor of art. He received several awards, including the Guggenheim Fellowship (1966) and the Logan Medal of the Arts (1964). Al Held passed away in 2005 in Camerata di Todi, Italy. ",1785
Leon Golub,"Leon Golub, born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1922, was an American painter who was both horrified and inspired by the Vietnam War. Many of his paintings in the 1960s and '70s were commentaries on the Vietnam War, and his works had a sense of gritty immediacy. He received his BA at the University of Chicago in 1942, and his BFA and MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1949 and 1950, respectively.",1786
Sam Gilliam,"An American abstract painter, Sam Gilliam is best known for his works that test the boundaries of color, form, texture, and the canvas itself. Gilliam was a part of the Washington Color School in the late 1950s through mid-1970s and has been associated with the Abstract Expressionists. Born in 1933 in Tupelo, Mississippi, Gilliam wanted to be a cartoonist from an early age and spent most of his time drawing. He attended the University of Louisville and received his B.A. degree in Fine Arts in 1955 and held his first solo exhibition at the University the same year. After serving the army, he continued his education at the University of Louisville as a student of Charles Crodel, where he received his M.A. degree in painting. In 1962, Gilliam moved to Washington, D.C., where he supported himself teaching at public schools. One of the great innovators in postwar American painting, Gilliam rose to prominence with his canonical Drape paintings, which expanded upon the tenets of Abstract Expressionism in entirely new ways. He suspended stretcherless lengths of painted canvas from the walls or ceilings of exhibition spaces, transforming the medium and the contexts in which it was viewed. He imparted a sculptural quality to the installations, allowing them to become site-responsive. ",1787
Thomas Downing,"American artist Thomas Downing is best known for his abstract color field paintings. In his work, he explored the possibilities of color and space, creating compositions that were free from traditional associations. Throughout the 1960s, he was associated with Washington Color Field Movement, which was founded by Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis in the 50s. Today Downing's work is part of several private and public collections, including the Phillips Collection, the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Harvard University Art Museum, and the National Gallery of Art. Thomas Downing, born in 1928 in Suffolk, Virginia, earned his bachelor's degree in 1948 from the Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, where he studied literature. However, throughout his studies, he cultivated an interest in art by visiting exhibitions at Randolph-Macon and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Eventually, Thomas decided to switch to art and entered the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. After receiving a grant, he traveled to Europe and entered Académie Julian in Paris. Downing's mentor at the Catholic University in Washington DC was Kenneth Noland, the founder of Washington Color School, who greatly influenced his artistic expression. The Color School, even though it is similar to abstract expressionism, should not be confused with it due to the orderliness of their works. Along with Noland, Mehring, Helen Frankenthaler, and Frank Stella. In 1964 Downing's work was included in the traveling exhibition titled Post-Painterly Abstraction by renowned art critic Clement Greenberg. In 1965 he participated in the highly influential show The Responsive Eye at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In the 1960s, the artist began creating grids and circles of dots compositions of varying colors, which came from his exploration of possibilities of color and color-space. In his paintings, the cycles of various sizes and colors seem to float within a space that is not defined. The arranged and precise pattern was of utmost importance to Downing. Inspired by Helen Frankenthaler's and Morris Louis's works, he produced powerful compositions that seemed to pulsate. Later the artist began experimenting with shaped canvases, which eventually he included into his repertoire. The first exhibition that included them was the Systemic Painting show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1966. Unfortunately, in the 1970s, the public lost interest in his art, and the demand for his work decreased. After several relocations around the USA, he finally settled in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Downing taught the next generation of Color School painters at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, among them Sam Gilliam. Thomas Downing passed away in 1985 in his home in Provincetown. The same year two major shows celebrated his work and legacy: Addison/Ripley Fine Art gallery and Phillips Collection, both located in Washington, DC. Throughout his career, he showcased his work in several major institutions, including the Whitney Museum, Allan Stone and the Stable Gallery, and the Museum of Modern Art. ",1788

Lawrence Weiner,"Lawrence Weiner is an American artist, one of the central figures in the formation of conceptual art in the 1960s. His work often takes the form of typographic texts. Born in 1942 in the Bronx, New York, Weiner graduated from Stuyvesant High School at 16 and had a variety of jobs, working on an oil tanker, on docks, and unloading railroad cars. After studying at Hunter College for less than a year, he traveled throughout North America before returning to New York. As an artist, he is self-taught. His work has been exhibited in a range of venues, including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, Dia Center for the Arts, New York, Musée d'Art Contemporain, Bordeaux, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Philadelphia Museum of Art (1994), and Museum Ludwig, Cologne.

Although celebrated as a conceptual artist, Weiner sees himself as a sculptor, defining his sculptural medium simply as ""language + the material referred to"" in the sense that language is a material for construction.",1790
John Armleder,"Known far and wide for his performance acts and sculptural pieces, John Armleder is a Swiss author that finds creativity and inspiration within what he calls a supermarket of forms. It is possible to connect this artist's artworks with many different movements and artistic concepts, such as the Suprematism, Minimalism and the infamous Dada. Although it covers a wide range of mediums and techniques, in its core, John's art explores decoration as the impending devolution of cultural and artistic expressions[1]. Surprisingly complex with his concepts and playful in style, Armleder is responsible for authoring some of the most interesting and unusual pieces that emerged from Europe in the last half a century. [caption id=""attachment_337854"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] John Armleder - La ora i te forerei 2001 - Image via galeriecaratsch.com[/caption]  John Armleder acquired his artistic education at the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva, as well at the Glamorgan Summer School. After graduating, the young artist established the Groupe Ecart with friends Patrick Lucchini and Claude Rychner. This organization played a big role in the European scene during the 1970s and 1980s as it was responsible for introducing a large number of notable artists to the Old Continent - namely Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol. In the meantime, Armleder never stopped developing his own creative vocabulary. He had a habit of constantly examining the context in which his work was displayed, so the very act of exhibition became a genuine medium for John, as well as the key feature of his work. Since the 1990s, this author has created installations, paintings, sculpted pieces and what he likes to call Furniture Sculptures[2] - pieces that juxtapose furniture with monochrome or abstract paintings. Besides dramatically varying in form, Armleder's work also used chance as a method of producing the final form of the piece - a characteristic often associated with the music of John Cage.  [caption id=""attachment_337855"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] John Armleder - Ciliata (FS), 1994, and Foraminifers (FS), 1994 - Image via nyogalleristnycom[/caption]  As it was clued at earlier, Armleder was associated with many artistic groups over the course of his long career. He is considered to be a leading figure of the 1960/70s Fluxus as well as the key individual of the Neo-Geo group (short for Neo-Geometric Conceptualism). Additionally, it should also be noted that Armleder was, along with the aforementioned Patrick Lucchini and Claude Rychner, the founder of the Galerie Ecart which had the role of acting as a performance art space and independent publishing house. Considering all of these activities and combining them with the fact his varied work is extremely interesting, it comes as no surprise whatsoever that John is present on virtually all the lists that deal with the most prominent and key Swiss artists of the last and the current century.

El Pez,"Pez or El Pez is a pseudonym for a Barcelona-born artist who began his artistic career by writing his tag on the streets of hometown in 1999. Searching for an original language to interact with the pedestrians, the Spanish artist soon shifted from writing his tag to using the figure of a grinning fish which led to the emergence of his current moniker - El Pez (The Fish in Spanish). Over the years the images of smiling fish have evolved to a varied range of characters and doodles that are easily recognizable. Soon after El Pez had invaded the streets of Spain's second most populated city, he went on to travel to Madrid, Pamplona, Las Palmas, Valencia, Bilbao, Sevilla, as well as to various European metropolis including Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Milan. Pez’s colourfull and jolly works became instantly recognizable throughout Europe thanks to its uniqueness, as well as the artist’s perseverance and hard work.  In 2006 he traveled to South America to paint in Venezuela, Colombia and Peru. Being part the K-Swiss Tour, El Pez travelled to the some of the biggest Asia’s cities including to Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei.

Rene Magritte,"With his highly magical Surrealist imagery, Rene Magritte had a way of breathing new life into seemingly ordinary subject matters. This Belgian surrealist artist often painted everyday objects intentionally placed far out of their contexts, making them a part of such compositions that forced the viewer to reconsider things normally taken for granted. For example, in his iconic The Treachery of Images, Magritte painted a hyper-realistic pipe and beneath it wrote this is not a pipe — this kind of caution was a focal point of Rene's art, he taught us not to trust our eyes. He also reminded us that the art object, no matter what it was or how convincing it seemed, was not the real thing - even though it's often easy to fool yourself into believing that what you see is all authentic.    With a full name of René François Ghislain Magritte, this artist was born in Lessines, a province of Hainaut, during the year of 1898. He turned out to be the eldest son of Leopold Magritte, a tailor and textile merchant, and Regina, a retired milliner that forsake her vocation due to marriage responsibilities. His father’s manufacturing business at times allowed the family to live in relative comfort, but financial difficulties were a constant threat and forced them to move about the country with some regularity, chasing the places with lesser taxes and cheaper cost. As for the life of little Rene, little is known to this day with certainty. Besides constant travels and relocations with his family, Magritte started drawing in the year of 1910. On the 12th March in 1912, the future artist suffered the worst day of his young life as his mother committed suicide by drowning herself in the River Sambre - this was actually not Regina's first attempt to take her own life, as she had quite a history of suicidal tendencies. According to an interesting and frightening legend, 13-year-old Magritte was present when her body was retrieved from the water, but recent research has discredited this story, claiming it may have originated with the family nurse. Supposedly, when his mother was found, her dress was covering her face, an image that has been suggested as the source of several oil paintings Magritte painted in 1927-1928 in which people had cloth obscuring their faces. This is just one - and probably the most tragic one at that - of many influences whose roots can be traced to Rene's childhood and who proved to be a crucial aspect of his future career.    Magritte's earliest oil paintings, which date to a time around the year of 1915, were quite Impressionistic in style and showed Rene's early tendencies to strive for styles that have been long forsaken and defined. Between the years of 1916 and 1918, during the aftermath of the First World War and all its horrors, Magritte studied at the Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, under the wings of Constant Montald. However, the young artist did not find mister Montald's guidance too inspiring, so Magritte started straying away from Impressionism and its concepts. He stuck to oil as the material of his choice and in the 1918-1924 period Rene started to discover the potential and ideas of both the famous Futurism and Cubism - most of his works from this time are female nudes. During the year of 1922, Magritte married Georgette Berger, whom he had met as a child in 1913, a year after the one his mother died. The next few years were very turbulent for Rene, as he served in the Belgian infantry in the Flemish town of Beverlo, worked as a draughtsman in a wallpaper factory and was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926. In an interesting turn of events, Magritte got an opportunity in 1926 to sign a contract with Galerie la Centaure in Brussels, allowing him to paint full time. The same year, his first surreal oil painting came to be - the now legendary Lost Jockey (Le jockey perdu). Although it is today considered to be a classic of modern art, back in the mid-1920s, The Lost Jockey was regarded to be an utter failure as Magritte held his first exhibition in the year of 1927 and critics heaped abuse on the young painter.  Depressed by the failure of The Jockey and insulted for the way Belgian critics treated him, Rene Magritte moved to Paris where he became friends with Andre Breton and got himself involved in the surrealist group which accepted his ideas with open arms. However, even though the time in France started out as a success, Rene soon became bored and his (now international) contract with the Galerie la Centaure came to an end in 1929, so penniless Magritte made a decision to return to Brussels the next year. Having made little impact in Paris, Magritte resumed working in advertising - he and his brother Paul formed an agency which earned him a living wage. However, the artist never seized to create paintings, privately continuing to develop his aesthetics. As some of his paintings started to somehow float to surface without the artist actually promoting them, Rene's work caught the eye of the surrealist patron Edward James - this man allowed Magritte to stay rent free in his London home and paint. It was here that the artist established his style even further, but yet again was not able to make an impact he desired. All the while he was in London, Magritte stayed in correspondence with Breton, as the two were in an artistic relationship of ideas and concepts, as well as being close friends ever since Rene spent some time in The City of Light.    Soon after he departed to London, Magritte was yet again forced to return to Brussels due to lack of funds and success. His aforementioned brother welcomed him back into family business and Rene went back to his rhythm of advertising during the day and painting at night. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War Two, Magritte never fled his country and remained in Brussels the entire time, which led to a break with Breton who wanted his friend by his side in Paris. Rene briefly adopted a colorful, painterly style in the war years of 1943-44, an interlude known as his Renoir Period - widely accepted as a reaction to his feelings of alienation and abandonment that came with living in German-occupied Belgium. As the death of his mother, it appears that the WWII tragedies also had a negative effect on Rene's art, turning him to darker creative waters then he was used to by then. In 1946, as the Second World War was starting to be perceived as a distant nightmare, the artist renounced the violence and pessimism of his earlier work and joined several other Belgian artists in signing the manifesto Surrealism in Full Sunlight. During this time, Magritte supported himself through the production of fake paintings ""authored"" by Picasso, Van Gogh, Manet and Paul Cezanne - a fraudulent repertoire he was later to expand into the printing of forged banknotes during the lean postwar period. At the end of 1948, he returned to the style and themes of his prewar surrealistic art.  As he was constantly evolving in style and concepts, Magritte wished to cultivate an approach that avoided the stylistic distractions of most modern painting. While some French Surrealists experimented with new techniques, Magritte settled on an illustrative technique that clearly articulated the content of his pictures. It should be noted that the men wearing bowler hats that often appear in Magritte's pictures can be interpreted as self-portraits! Magritte was fascinated by the interactions of textual and visual signs, and some of his most famous pictures employ both words and images. While those pictures often share the air of mystery that characterizes much of his Surrealist work, they often seem motivated more by a spirit of rational inquiry - and wonder - at the misunderstandings that can lurk in language. Repetition was an important strategy for Magritte, informing not only his handling of motifs within individual pictures but also encouraging him to produce multiple copies of some of his greatest works. His interest in the idea may have come in part from Freudian psychoanalysis, for which repetition is a sign of trauma - Freud was a big part of the original Breton's ideas associated with Surrealism, so naturally, Rene was well educated with the father of psychotherapy. But his work in the commercial art may have also played a role in prompting him to question the conventional modernist belief in the unique, original work of art. With the arrival of the 1950s, Magritte enjoyed an ongoing international interest in his work and continued his prolific output. Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on 15 August 1967 in his own bed and was interred in Schaerbeek Cemetery, Evere, Brussels.    Popular interest in Magritte's work rose considerably in the 1960s and he reached the highest peak of popularity after his death - as is the case with many great artists. René Magritte's now iconic imagery has heavily influenced pop, minimalist and conceptual art, whilst forever serving as one of the most instantly recognizable trademarks Surrealism movement has to offer. Magritte’s highly figurative style is often discussed along the work of Salvador Dalí and Giorgio de Chirico, while his persistent interrogation of objects has both influenced and paved the way for many aspiring young artists, not to mention they've been fascinating and entertaining the members of the art scene circles for decades now.

Ellen Gallagher,"American contemporary artist, Ellen Gallagher (b.1965), in her work examines the evolution of African American stereotypes. Inspired by postwar era beauty advertisements targeting African-American women, she incorporates them in her collages, paintings, and films. Although at first glance her work might appear minimalistic, is in fact a complex investigation of questions of social class, gender, and racial identity. Gallagher's work is part of numerous international collections, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Tate, London; MOCA, Los Angeles; MoMA, New York; Whitney Museum of Art, New York, and Centre Pompidou, Paris. In 2000 she was the recipient of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Art.   Ellen Gallagher was born in Providence, US, and at a young age attended a top preparatory school, the Quaker college, and a year at the Oberlin College in Ohio, where she studied writing. After dropping out, she briefly worked as a fisherman in Alaska and with the carpenters' union in Seattle. In 1992 she graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and went on to study in Maine at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 1995 after her solo show held at the Mary Boone in New York, Gallagher gained recognition as an artist. The artist purposely chose this space for it is a neutral ground where her work, specifically its abstract quality could stand out. In her work, she is particularly interested and inspired by 19th-century American musical theater. It was the era of the blackface minstrelsy, where instead of employing black actors, the institutions used makeup to blacken the faces of white performers.   Inspired by Gertrude Stein’s writing and paintings of Agnes Martin, Ellen creates artworks with a subjective narrative. This multimedia artist creates abstract paintings that possess a strong tension between fantasy and reality. Through her minimalistic work, she illuminates today's problems that come from established designations concerning nations and race. Inspired by images advertising skin-whitening and hair-straightening products from magazines like Sepia and Ebony, the artist created the DeLuxe series in 2005. For the series Watery Ecstatic, Gallagher created an underwater world, Drexciya, populated by slaves who were casualties of the transatlantic trade. Using a variation of the scrimshaw technique where the artist instead on ivory carves images on a watercolor paper to depict the rich world of the Black Atlantis. Often the artist manipulates images from magazines by removing texts, cutting them apart, and applying them to canvas.   Gallagher’s DeLuxe series was showcased in 2005 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Her artwork is often, thanks to various methods, such as puncturing, staining, and smudging, transformed to illegibility, yet it possesses an arresting composition of subtle textures. Throughout her rich career, the artist has exhibited her work in numerous venues, including the Freud Museum, London; Henry Art Gallery, Seattle; Drawing Center, New York and Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami, to name a few.  Ellen Gallagher currently lives and works between New York and Rotterdam, Netherlands.

John Cage,"Recognized as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century and a leading figure in the post-war avant-garde scene, John Cage was an American musician, theorist, writer and artist. Besides being considered to be a pioneer of indeterminacy in music and non-standard use of instruments, Cage is also held in high regard for his visual pieces, namely paintings and prints. Additionally, he was also deemed pivotal in the development of modern dance and performance art. John Cage's work challenged the definitions of what a composer does, music and musical experience, as well as the broader new aesthetics of art and performance pieces.  John Cage was born on the 5th of September in the year of 1912, at Good Samaritan Hospital in downtown Los Angeles. His father was John Milton Cage Sr., a successful man who was regarded as an inventor by the local populace. Cage's mother, Lucretia Harvey, worked as a part-time journalist for the Los Angeles Times and was an oftentimes depressed person. Although there is no proving this to be a fact, the Cage bloodline is supposedly trackable to an ancestor named John Cage who was George Washington's assistant and had a task of surveying the Colony of Virginia. Cage's first experiences with music were received from the private piano teachers in the Greater Los Angeles. Cage also had an aunt, Phoebe Harvey James, who was rather talented in the music department. However, Cage was more interested in writing then composing and this is what got him involved with the valedictorian field[1]. Even then, when he was still a rather young man, John Cage already laid his theoretical grounds for the famous 4'33"" composition of silence. In one of his written essays from the time he was a student of the Los Angeles High School, John Cage wrote the following: By being hushed and silent, we should have the opportunity to hear what other people think. In 1928, the young theorist enrolled at Pomona College in Claremont, aiming at the theology major. John Cage yet again started merging disciplines, as he was always prone to doing. He encountered the work of artist Marcel Duchamp via one of his Pomona professors and decided to drop from college in order to pursue a similar line of work.   After much wheedling, Cage managed to persuade his parents that a trip to Europe would be more beneficial to a future writer than any amount of college studies. After that, John hitchhiked to Galveston and sailed to Le Havre. He later made his way to the City of Light. Cage stayed in Europe for about eighteen months and spent most of his time trying his hand at various forms of art. Although he did focus on modern expression the most, John also studied Gothic and Greek architecture. He also took up painting, poetry and music - especially the work of the legendary Johann Sebastian Bach, something Cage never had an opportunity to hear earlier in his life. After the Euro trip came to an end, young artist took his enthusiasm back home in 1931. He went to live in Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art based on his direct explorations of the Old Continent. By the year of 1933, Cage decided to concentrate on music composing rather than painting. John explained such a decision by stating the following: The people who heard my music had better things to say about it than the people who looked at my paintings had to say about my paintings. In order to advance himself in the music department, the artist traveled to the Big Apple and started taking lessons at The New School of music. Several months later, still in 1933, Cage became sufficiently good at composition and he was offered to become the next student of famous Schoenberg - free of charge. At some point in 1934, John met and fell in love with a fellow artist Xenia Andreyevna Kashevaroff. The two were married in the desert at Yuma, Arizona, on the 7th of June, 1935.   The newly married couple first lived with Cage's parents in Pacific Palisades for a few months, but then moved to Hollywood. Between the years of 1936 and 1938, Cage changed numerous jobs, including one that started his lifelong association with modern dance - a position of a dance accompanist at UCLA. He was in charge of producing compositions for choreographies and it was here that Cage first started experimenting with unorthodox instruments, such as household items, metal sheets and so on. In the meantime, the artist's thirst for visual expression yet again emerged from the depth of his inner self - he frequently traveled to New York City and eventually became a part of the local art scene. Through such travels, John met and became friends with such painters as Max Ernst, Peggy Guggenheim, Piet Mondrian, André Breton, Jackson Pollock, and many others. This American composer made something like music in New York, presenting a large number of prepared pieces that featured no sound, introducing numerous changes to the medium. He even met and befriended his idol, Marcel Duchamp, as he visited New York and wanted to listen to one of his piano music works. He was interested in visual pieces of his fellow artists whilst they were intrigued by Cage's avant-garde musical concepts. However, Cage's artistic life went through a crisis in the mid-1940s. The public rarely accepted his work and Cage he himself had trouble understanding the music of his colleagues, meaning he was often disregarded by both his fellow musicians and the audience[2]. This, naturally, led to many depressing emotions within Cage's mind, severely shaking his confidence. This was the time John dedicated much of his time to writing about music and art in general, discussing his philosophical views on both matters. Years of 1948 and 1952 were pivotal for Cage's music and sounds as it was then that he received classical piano lessons on sonatas from a professional composer.       At one point of the early 1950s, Cage was offered an opportunity to teach at the avant-garde Black Mountain College just outside Asheville, NC. This helped him regain his confidence and set him back on the course of the modern dance. He wrote his widely read and influential book titled Silence, the first one of what will become a five book series. Cage's work from the sixties features some of his largest and most ambitious pieces to date, heavily reflecting the mood of the era. It was then that John produced the first fully notated work in years - Cheap Imitation for piano. The piece is a chance-controlled reworking of Erik Satie's Socrate and it was openly sympathetic to its source. This artwork marked a major change in Cage's music as he turned again to writing fully notated works for traditional instruments and tried out several new approaches along the way, such as improvisation. However, Cheap Imitation ultimately became the last work John ever performed in public himself. Arthritis had troubled Cage since the year of 1960, and by the early 1970s, his hands were painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform in such fashion. Instead, he started to paint in watercolors[3], in an abstract method which did not require too much precision from Cage's limbs as music did. His paintings were oftentimes combined with his musical concepts, always leading to interesting results which are unlike anything the scene has seen prior to Cage. John as well started working in another field - the opera. This was the climax of Cage's artistic career as this was the first time the composer/artist undoubtedly wanted to be involved within a field without compromising it with other mediums.    During the mid and late 1980s, Cage's health worsened progressively, The problem with arthritis was mixed with sciatica and arteriosclerosis as John suffered a stroke that left the movement of his left leg restricted. The transitoriness and fragility of his well-being were extremely obvious in his later works as Cage accepted his fate and did not allow fear to find its place between him and his art. On August 11, 1992, while he was preparing evening two cups of tea for himself and his friend Cunningham, Cage suffered another stroke in New York. He died during the morning. Ultimately, what remains behind him is an incredible legacy of impacts on various creative fields, underlined by his unique view on the music, world and art. Since words were Cage's favorite expression tool[4], we find it fitting that the end of this short biography be concluded with Cage's following words: Left to itself art would have to be something very simple - it would be sufficient for it to be beautiful. But when it's useful it should spill out of just being beautiful and move over to other aspects of life so that when we're not with the art it has nevertheless influenced our actions or our responses.

Sergio Camargo,"Sérgio de Camargo was a Brazilian sculptor and relief maker best known for wall-based reliefs, public sculptures and architectural commissions. His monochromatic reliefs and sculptures are simple, elegant explorations of mass and void. Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1933, de Camargo began his art education at the Academia Altamira in Buenos Aires under Lucio Fontana and Emilio Pettoruti. Moving to Paris in 1948, he enrolled at the Academie de la Grand Chaumiere and studied at the Sorbonne, where he encountered the philosopher Gaston Bachelard. His greatest influence was Constantin Brancusi’s study of the natural world through the lens of volumetric forms. After returning to Brazil in 1950s, he became immersed into the rising Neo-Concrete Constructivist and Kinetic Op Art movements. He once again returned to Paris, living there between 1961 and 1974, and becoming a member of the Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV) in 1963. During the late 1960s Sérgio de Camargo showed work at numerous international exhibitions, including the 1965 São Paulo Biennale, the 1966 Venice Biennale, and the 1968 documenta in Kassel. Throughout his career, de Camargo was consistent in his use of color, working first with white and then with black since 1981. He focused on creating cylinders and prisms, with variance in volume and position. Throughout his practice, he explored the dramatic and expressive potential of light and shadow to accentuate the realm of lived experience.  ",1801

Lauren Baker,"As a multidisciplinary artist, Lauren Baker explores the fragility of life and what comes after that. Exactly as her approach to creating is multidisciplinary, so are the subjects of her art. She presents her interest in after-life through sculptures of animal and human skulls. Her ornate skulls have been recognized both in the art world and popular culture. Recent George Michael's music video – White Light, which featured Kate Moss had Lauren's skull art in it. Besides skull designs, she also does installations. 100 of her mirror eyes were attached to trees at Unknown Festival in Croatia.    Lauren's journey to becoming an artist is a strange one. After a trip to South America where she helped to do street art and more importantly, had an epiphany in the Peruvian Amazon, she decided she had enough with her life, gave up on her daily job and started doing sculptures. For Lauren, skulls represent the connection between this life and after-life. In the traditional Day of the Dead in Mexico, skulls question death as the true end, the similar importance they have for Lauren.  Her first exhibition was in the basement of a small pub, after which her career as an artist skyrocketed. Tate Britain heard of her strange mosaics and ravish sculptures and asked her to collaborate in the Damien Hirst exhibition. It didn't take long for galleries and people from popular culture to pay interest in her work. Soon enough, Lauren became known as Queen of the Skulls.   Later in her career, Lauren started getting interested in incorporating neon lights with moving sculptures and infinity mirrors. With the intrigue for reflective material and the ways it could be used, Lauren created the first infinity mirror coffin, which was later presented in Tate Britain. Title The White Light, it served as a „door to another world“. This installation deepened her interest in ways life and death are connected. But maybe one of her most intricate work as of recently is the one which was sold for 420k pounds. In collaboration with British piano brand Goldfinch, Lauren decorated a Steinway grand piano with half a million crystals, after which it was sold to a Qatar sheikh. Her lavish art pieces are both provocative and engaging to people. Why some might find it blatant, there are more of those who find her creativity both intriguing and worthy of presentation in various galleries.       Lauren is a young contemporary artist who managed to achieve a lot in a short time. With every next project, she takes a different approach in which she implements her interest in the topic of life and death. Similar as it's impossible to really know what comes after life, so it is hard to guess what her next work will be. Besides doing art, Lauren is also an ambassador for Save Wild Tigers, where her artwork has raised more than 50k pounds. Besides that, she curated Thrive exhibition which featured 20 artists. Taking place at the Sanderson in London and auctioned at the Mango Tree dinner, the event raised £62K. In 2016, Lauren still supports and contributes to the charity. She is represented by Hang-Up Gallery in London.  ",1804

Magnus Gjoen,"Magnus Gjoen is a multitalented London-born artist, of Norwegian origin, who explores how something that appears powerful and destructive can be transformed into elegant and fragile object of art. He often questions the role and relationship between religion, peace, conflict, and war in his practice.   Born in England’s capital to Norwegian parents, Gjoen studied design in London and at the Insituto Marangoni in Milan. He has worked as a denim designer and graphic designer for British fashion legend Vivienne Westwood and in product development at the American brand Lee Jeans, amongst others. Having a background in fashion, the artist has brought a modern punk-sensibility to his practice. He revisits old concepts and finds beauty in destructive objects trying to twist their meaning into something that is relevant to contemporary society.    Gjoen’s delicate images of beauty and death, depicting symbols such as skulls and weaponry, reminds viewers of the ephemeral nature of conceivable pursuits. His pieces have the ability to turn dark and strong imagery into something tender and soft. By infusing his work with a mixture of dark humor, pop art and urban art into his fine art prints, the artist has captured the attention of the next generation of art collectors who relate to his perspicacious comments on contemporary society. In his pieces, the artist works digitally, building virtual 3D structures in Illustrator, before adding meticulous detail and shadow in Photoshop.   Gjoen is known for sampling imagery dating back to as early as the 14th century and mixing it with street and pop art producing original and modern takes on old masterpieces or manipulating something ferocious and vigorous into something fragile but alluring. For the past several years he has been creating pieces inspired by different sources, especially by Renaissance and Flemish masters, religion and war while the human race itself is often his favoured subject.    The London-born artist also explores his artistic potential through the medium of porcelain, producing sculptures inspired by his digital prints, while continuing to express his messages through more daring and subversive prints.    In March 2015, Gjoen presented a brand new collection of multi-media originals and limited editions titled Monster in London-based Hang-Up gallery. The series of works explores and analyses the mind of a serial killer and their pre occupation with fantasy stemming from childhood. For the first time the artist has experimented with a variety of materials such as Perspex and wood as opposed to working flat and digitally. Monster illustrates the extremely organized, yet befuddled mind of a serial killer, by fusing affectionate, attractive imagery with bold, primitive colours. The artist investigates how imagination can be the main part in the creation of a monster by using primitive shape and form overlaid with otherworldly scenes.   Coming from a fashion and graphics background, Magnus decided to turn his full attention to his art several years ago. Since then he has participated in more than twenty exhibitions and art fairs. His work was included in group shows in Lawrence Alkin Gallery, London; Underdog Gallery, London; Soze Gallery, LA; and Galleri Geo, Bergen, Norway, to name a few. His first solo exhibition was Between Heaven & Hell at Hang-Up Gallery, London in December 2013. He is represented by Hang-Up Gallery and Verso Contemporary, both in London.

Shae DeTar,"Shae DeTar is an American photographer and artist, known for her wildly evocative, colorful and fiercely bold hand-colored photograph-painting hybrids, shot in surreal locations. She adds layers of paint to emphasize color, texture and a fantastical element.  Shae DeTar grew up between Pennsylvania and New York. When she was 18, she worked for a few years as a model in Milan, Italy. Back in New York, DeTar studied graphic design at the School of Visual Art.  The artist's practice is divided into two distinct actions - she takes the photograph first, and afterwards paints prints of photographs by hand, using both Acrylic and watercolor. Shae became interested in the technique as a teenager, when she started hand-painting on the photographs she’d find in magazines.   Young nude girls are the subject of most part of her personal, very imaginative work, painted with the bright vibrant hues, and shot in captivating, otherworldly landscapes. However, she seeks to portray a nude female form without the over-sexualization of the image that our culture is saturated with.   Using analog and digital photography, DeTar manages to filter her sensibilities into work, creating her own visual utopia. Her hazy and almost transcendental images are inspired by the paintings of old masters, such as Van Gogh, Egon Schiele, Jean-Édouard Vuillard, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Klimt, Picasso, and Matisse.  Successful in both personal and commercial endeavors, Shae DeTar shoots regularly for The New Yorker Magazine, and her images have been featured in publications such as Nylon Magazine and Juxtapose, among others. In addition, the artist has shot campaigns for fashion brands such as Cosabella, Free People, Erin Fetherston and Alice and Olivia, and a billboard for Aritizia.

Tim Doyle,"Tim Doyle is an American illustrator and print-maker, best known for his UnReal Estate series in which he re-imagines iconic fictional locations placed in worlds of popular television shows.  Doyle grew up in the suburbs of Dallas, spending his time reading comic-books and playing video games. Thanks to his mother, the artist started drawing from an early age. She encouraged him to draw for hours, to express himself through images. At the same time, Tim started learning how to read mostly through comics. He moved to Austin, Texas in 1999. From 2001 till 2003, Doyle self-published a zine titled Amazing Adult Fantasy, inspired by his personal experiences. In 2009, Tim launched and established his own screen printing studio and nerd-art collective named Nakatomi. Working together with the artist Clint Wilson, the studio is active in commercial printing for outside clients. Their clients include Creature Design, The Astor Theatre, ABC’s Lost Poster project, Hasbro, Lucasfilm, DC, and many more.  UnReal Estate is Doyle’s most significant series of artworks. In the series, the artist has taken mythical places from various popular shows like The Simpsons, King of the Hill, Futurama, Sesame Street and Arrested Development, and painted them in a dramatic, moody style with a remarkable work on the lights and atmosphere. The whole series is an example of how the settings and locations of the things you love can become just as distinctive as the characters that occupy them. He aims to preserve and honor the non-physical spaces found in popular shows, such as Moe’s tavern from the legendary Simpsons.  Since his first gallery exhibition in 2001, Tim has been featured in many group and solo shows. His major exhibitions were the ones hosted by Spoke Art - 4 sold-out one-man shows, which featured his dark and dismal UnReal Estate series of hand-printed screenprints and original art. He is represented by Spoke Art Gallery located in San Francisco, CA.  Images courtesy of Spoke Art and the artist",1813
Friedrich Heinrich Fuger,"Friedrich Heinrich Füger was a German Neoclassical painter, recognized as one of the most important portraitist and miniaturist. He is also known as a painter of historical subjects. While his miniatures are often painted in a surprisingly easy style with fascinating color combinations, he generally followed a strict style in his paintings.  Born in 1751 in Heilbronn, Wurttemberg, Füger was already painting miniature portraits at the age of 8. In 1764 he enrolled at the Hohe Karlsschule in Stuttgart and received drawing lessons from Nicolas Guibal. Later he moved to Halle to study law, but returned to painting in 1771, encouraged by public demand for his miniatures. In the same year the artist moved to Leipzig and became a pupil of Adam Friedrich Oeser.  Returning from this two-year training, he was introduced to the works of the Italian Renaissance by Guibal. He later traveled to Rome and Naples and studied the Italian masters, and also left his mark by painting frescoes in the The Royal Palace of Caserta.  In 1774, Füger moved to Vienna. Supported by the imperial court, he was commissioned for his miniatures, and also became professor and director of the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1806, he became a head of the Imperial Picture Gallery in Vienna. Füger's works are regularly sold at auctions. He is represented by Puccio Fine Art, located in New York.  ",1814

Jan Voss,"Jan Voss is a versatile German artist, working in painting, sculpture, engraving and ceramics. He is best known for collaged works on canvas which incorporate rudimentary, figure-like shapes and scrawling, painted lines. Born in 1936 in Hamburg, Germany, Voss lives and works between Paris and Berlin. After studying at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts from 1956 to 1960, he moved to Paris and became a teacher at the École Nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, teaching there from 1987 to 1992. A monograph by Yves Michaud was published in 2001 and a second by Anne Tronche in 2015. He has exhibited his work in a range of venues, including the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Dunkerque, the Palais Synodal in Sens and the Arnhem Museum in the Netherlands. His works are in the collections of the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the Museum of Fine Arts in Dunkirk, and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. Voss lives and works in Gentilly, France. Through his practice, Voss seeks to ""create order"" in the midst of the perpetually moving chaos of a complex situation. Experimenting with various different techniques and materials, he creates powerfully vibrant works on canvas in saturated color as well as quiet, narrative works that are more linear than painterly. These are in contrast with paper reliefs made up collage-like of torn watercolors. ",1816

David Bromley,"When one artist defines himself as high school drop-out, surf bum, and a lost boy who discovered clay – his art couldn’t be anything less than charming and honest. David Bromley first employed art just to help him pacify his overactive mind, but then he fell in love and decided to dedicate his whole life to it.  Bromley was born in Sheffield, England, in 1960. When he was four years old, his family moved to Australia where he grew up and got interested in pottery. Soon, he shifted his focus, becoming a painter who emerged on the Adelaide art scene in the mid-80s. It didn’t take long for the public to recognize this artist’s innovative approach, so David Bromley became a well-known artist in Australia, but worldwide as well. David draws inspiration and ideas mostly from his the books of his childhood but pop artists like Warhol and Lichtenstein as well. His large-scale artworks could be defined as figurative expressionism done in a Pop Art manner. The themes he covers are mostly classified into three groups - Boys Own adventure project, Female Nude series, and Butterflies. What these series have in common is David’s figurative method and his use of vivid colors.   For the project about Boys Own adventure, Bromley was inspired by The Boy's Own Paper, a British story paper for the young and teenage boys, coming out between 1879 and 1967. The aim of this project is to explore phenomena of innocence that belongs to children only and to question the possibility of finding once lost purity and naturalness of one’s soul. Paintings belonging to this enigmatic series linger somewhere between sentimentality and symbolism, but were never explained by the author as he prefers to avoid the explicitly of a message sent and to leave the interpretation to a viewer’s imagination and his life experience.   David’s portrays of nude females are made in layering and texturing techniques, carried out in a metallic paint. The leitmotif of leaves is merged with black outlines and vibrant colors. The way Bromley fused traditional portrait and contemporary expression in Female Nudes series, only emphasize this artist’s skill to create an original and seductive art piece depicting a femme fatale.   Before moving to Melbourne, David has been painting in sort of a partly outside studio in semi-tropical surroundings, listening and absorbing any hint of a communication nature offered. His first painted butterflies date from this period of time. After moving to a noisy city (even though he enjoy its busy streets), Bromley felt the urge to start painting butterflies again. Only, this time, it wasn’t a product of direct inspiration from butterflies’ visits in Byron – for these painting, the author had to take a trip to the garden he nurtures inside his mind, dreams and imagination. Any piece done by David Bromley offers viewers his characteristic graphic brushwork, blurring lines between the color of the subject and the color of the background, due to his heavy layering of paint. However, he is extremely precise in his expression, and sometimes all he needs to capture the appearance or manner of someone’s face is just one brush stroke.   From the beginning of his career, Bromley held more than 30 solo exhibitions throughout the entire Australia, Europe, Asia, States, and Africa. Actually, if we don’t count Antarctic, he has been exhibiting on any continent there is! No wonder he is listed as one of Australia’s 50 most collectible artists by the Australian Art Collector magazine. Numerous private and public collections acquired his work, so it could be seen in London, Paris, Tokyo, Johannesburg, United States… This artist was a four-time finalist for the Archibald Prize, the most important portraiture prize in Australia and was commissioned to portrait many famous people, like filmmaker Scott Hicks, actor Hugo Weaving and pop-star Kylie Minogue amongst the others.   Today, Bromley is well-known artist – a brilliant portraitist, who established a little artistic oasis named Bromley&Co. As he explains, it is the web that connects artists and artisans in an effort to assist and answer to any type of intervention needed in a field of art, design, interiors, and fashion. Bromley&Co is led by an artist and his wife Yume, but also by many of their friends, relatives, and colleagues. One rule is strictly applied on this project – and that is to obey the custom to choose projects based on their feeling and passion.  This artist is represented by The Cat Street Gallery.

Jorge Macchi,"Jorge Macchi is an Argentinian artist who combines music and painting. Also a sculptor and filmmaker, he makes profound art using all of these mediums, in order to highlight the simplicity of the message he's sending. Macchi was born in 1963 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he still lives and works. He studied art at the National School of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires. He exhibited in a range of venues, including Musée Cantonal Des Beux Arts, Lausanne, Galería Ruth Benzacar, Buenos Aires, Galleria Continua, San Gimignano, Italy, Quartz Studio, Torino, Italy, Centro de Arte 2 de Mayo, Madrid, Galeria Luisa Strina, San Pablo and NC ARTE, Bogota, Colombia.

Working in a wide range of mediums, Macchi begins his process with a drawing. While some images would remains as drawings, others would evolve into three-dimensional works or videos. In his practice, the artist explores chance and the accidental. He often uses readymades, such as newspaper clippings, city maps, and sheet music.",1820
Terry Allen,"Terry Allen, a visual artist with a big heart, is one of the most loved personalities from the world of American Southwest. Musician, sculptor and theater enthusiast, Terry Allen is the perfect example of a Renaissance man. No matter if he’s composing a song or creating a sculpture, his unique sense of humor and criticism of the corporate machinery shine through his work.  His playful mind doesn’t take music and paintings too seriously and prefers to see them as a source of personal joy. He loves to cite the great master of photography, Man Ray, who once said : You know, it’s OK to be a really bad artist, because they don’t hurt anybody. Not like a bad doctor.  Terry Allen grew up in Lubbock in Texas, which is certainly not the most exciting place for a child. Allen spent his young days hiding out in movie theaters and he knew every single theater in Lubbock in the 1950s. These places were shelter for young  Allen, who wanted to get away from problematic, alcohol-fueled atmosphere at home. Allen grew up in  a musical environment since his father used to sing and play country music at home, so it is not surprising that he picked up music at very early age. However, when it comes to painting, there was absolutely no one in Lubbock engaged in any sort of visual arts and Allen blames the city of Lubbock itself for the lack of talented individuals since it’s a boring flat place with harsh summers that last all year long, kill plants and make people tired. During his teenage years, the biggest visual impact for Allen came from the rock and roll stars and the aesthetics they cultivated. Also, once he was able to buy a car, he started to run away from Lubbock as often as possible.  He decided to move to California, where he went to (Choinard Art Institute) and lived in Los Angeles throughout the 60s, coming back to Lubbock only to visit his family. Already in 1966, Allen was established as a musician, sculptor and painter.   Allen discovered, after he graduated from Choinard, that he can’t choose whether he enjoys more music or visual arts, so he kept being engaged in both realms. He writes brilliant lyrics for his music and his songs can’t be simply categorized as regular country songs. What he creates is a fine blend of rock and country, in which he sings about universal topics that anyone can relate to, such as family, love, religion, and violence. His work in multimedia also deals with universal issues, but there’s a significant portion of humor present in all of Allen’s sculptures, paintings, installations, even stage and radio plays. A good example of Allen’s approach is his sculptural installation called Humanature. It consists of 2 life-size figures, one male and one female, carved in clay and cast in bronze. The female statue is standing upside down, attached to a stone into which her head disappears while a headless male figure in business attire is leaning against a tree, looking confused and overwhelmed with problems. There are also some unintelligible sounds coming from the nearby speakers, as a part of the installation. These two figures symbolize the common human trait of turning a deaf ear, which means avoiding to acknowledge and accept reality. This is a very common human problem, especially in the modern era when we have to deal with so many things at the same time and Allen made a humorous remark about this behavioral trait through his installation.   Allen has received numerous awards for his work along with the great honors such as Guggenheim Fellowship and National Endowment for the Art Fellowships. His work has been exhibited throughout the United States and internationally, in San Paolo, Paris and Sydney. Also, his pieces are present in many private and public collections, the most notable among them being The Metropolitan Museum  and MOMA in New York. Exhibitions are just a small part of Allen’s success – he has also written a theater piece Dugout which was published in 2005 and he has worked in both radio and theater. No matter his major awards for sculptures and in theater, Allen never forgot his initial love that was music and has recorded 12 albums of original songs, first one called Juarez  and his most recent one from 2013, named Bottom of the World. He is still very active artist not only in music - his latest group exhibitions were held in 2016, in Austin and Houston, TX.   Terry Allen is equally famous for his music and visual art, but his paintings and sculpture have a wonderful complexity that completes his world of music. Allen is a musician who understood at some point that music is not enough and that he has much more to say. He chose visual arts as a means of the additional self-expression. His sculptures that can be found in various public places throughout the United States  are a brilliant commentary on many issues of the modern world, most notably the human obsession  with money, lack of face to face communication and slavery within corporate systems. All of that is wrapped up in Allen’s unique heart-warming humor. The artist is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art.  ",1821
Aya Takano,"When one artist’s inspiration roams between 14th Century Italian religious painting, MTV aesthetics and alien evidence, the final product must be worthy of attention. That is the case with the artwork created by Japanese artist Aya Takano, born in a city of Saitama - first mentioned in the famous 8th-century poetry anthology Man'yōshū. She grew up in this ancient city surrounded by her father’s natural science and science fiction library, which explains her unique style and curiosity towards the future. Aya creates her manga work in Superflat style, popularized by Murakami.    Aya used to read a lot in her childhood and she even said once how she thought that everything she read was true until she was nineteen! Talking about the imagination! Even now, Takano indulges her fantasies, letting herself think she possesses the ability to fly. There was no way this kind of girl would study anything else but art, and Takano made that clear to her parents. So, Aya Takano received her bachelor's degree from Tama Art University in Tokyo. Just around the time she graduated, great Murakami searched for talents among the young artists, with a goal to create the Superflat style artistic community. And this is how the Kaikai Kiki Co. was born. The method of emphasizing the two-dimensionality of figures visually based in Japanese manga and anime and combined with the fetishes of consumerism soon became popular worldwide and the Kaikai Kiki Co, counting seven members (five of them - women) started creating a universe of its own. Of course, one of those five women was Takano. Not long after Murakami met Takano and saw her work, she found herself being this artist’s assistant. Murakami was more than willing to be the mentor of an artist with such a unique imagination so he quickly jump-started her career.   Aya Takano transmitted onto her works her ever-growing fascination by any unusual form of nature or animal life, clearly identified in her works where she presents many exotic animals and plants. This approach of twisted reality soon gained a public of her own, attracted by the infantilization and objectification of the female - one of Takano’s regular themes, besides the senseless Japanese consumerism that grew to become a fetish itself. However, it wasn’t Takano who invented this combination where pre-pubescent girls are being a target of the consumer culture. So-called Otaku culture, mainly centered at the Akihabara district in Tokyo, was the fertile soil for this kind of fetish. Manga and anime obsession helped the members of this group to alienate almost completely from reality, creating a world of their own. The world where infantilization and objectification of the female were something completely normal and beyond acceptable.   Takano’s figures are often androgynous, playing a role of female heroine in society. She strongly dissociates from any sexual connotation, even though her females are usually only partially clothed or even fully nude. Takano claims that her aim is to reinvent the entire otaku culture, this time only through the feminine perspective. Her heroines are still growing, finding themselves on the border between the adulthood and childhood, and the red dots on their elbows, knees, and shoulders, together with their bulbous heads, and large eyes prove that they are still in the process of growing, both physically and mentally.  Today, a girl who still thinks from time to time she can fly, is a well-known manga artist, illustrator, and science fiction author.  Outside Japan, the world enthusiastically embraced her somewhat odd universe, following closely Takano’s new works, waiting for her strange-looking girls to lighten up their world. She is represented by Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art from Miami and Galerie Perrotin from Hong Kong.  ",1822

Elian,"Like many other positive things, art can be therapeutic and have healing properties. Coming from Argentina, Elian Chali is a contemporary artist who, due to dyslexia, always had problems when it came to writing. However, all those problems seem to go away when he is holding a can of spray in his hands and painting on the walls around the world. Characterized by the close dialogue with the environment in which they are created, Elian’s works are composed through basic geometry and abstraction, and influenced by architecture, climate, and the current socio-political situations. His favorite theme is the city. Through his work, the artist seeks to open a discussion that goes from the social problems to the poetry of the habitat in which he creates.  Always interested in the environment and the surroundings in which he paints, Elian has been particularly interested in perspective in 2016. For his piece in the historical neighborhood of Barracas, Buenos Aires, he highlighted the original structure of the building with the intention of proving that the city functions as a dynamic body and suffers the evolution of adaptations every day. A piece created in Ostend, Belgium, titled Exercise Of Anamorphosis #2, is a continuation of his explorations of perspective. This time, he painted on a two-sided building, located on the corner and in front of the playground and a square. Based on generating the effect of image construction by finding the exact point of view from which the piece should be observed, this has been the second time that Elian exercised the technique of anamorphosis. As always, the composition is made of primary colors and geometric elements. What’s interesting about this piece and the applied technique is that with each new angle of observation comes the natural deformation of both perspective and methodology of the site.   Always working with a sketch in hand, Elian’s art has evolved from 3D graffiti to flat images. He studied graphic design but doesn’t have a particular affection towards “institutions”. When he started painting in the streets, he was fifteen and drawn to the field by many of his friends that were also working on the streets. As mentioned above, being dyslexic always meant having troubles with writing – with spray cans, he finally found the way to truly express himself without any problems. Everyone in his family was supportive of his decision to make art, and his mother even bought his first can of spray. His aesthetics are inspired by the Pop-Art, minimalism, Russian constructivism, and neoplasticism. Speaking of artists that are inspirational to him, El Tono, Jaz, and Momo stand out among those who paint in the public spaces. On the other side, he also enjoys the work of Pablo Siquier, Piet Mondrian and Sol LeWitt. In May 2016, Elian published Hábitat, a conceptual book where he discusses the city as socio-cultural phenomenon, pretending to understand the environment in which the humans live. Aside from Prologue written by the renowned american photographer and anthropologist Martha Cooper, this masterpiece also contains 143 images taken around the world and 3 essays. He is represented by Adda Gallery.  ",1824
Deborah Sengl,"Deborah Sengl is an Austrian artist whose paintings, drawings and sculptures pose many questions about the role of individual identity in the modern society. Her creative processes are quite unusual and may sound a bit eerie to the traditional audience, since she is working closely with a taxidermist and using animal skins to create hybrid animal-human forms in her sculptures and installations. The artist said about her projects: I therefore use the animal as a metaphor of human behaviour, because I find that it is distracting when one portrays people - everyone starts to have a subjective view of these people and that is quite distracting.  Sengl is interested not only in fine arts, but also  and scene  and costume design. She studied at the University of applied Arts in Vienna and later on at the University of Arts in Berlin. After obtaining her BFA, she worked as a lecturer at Mozarteum in Salzburg, from 2011 to 2013. Her study of costume design influenced her future career as an artist because she has already gained a solid knowledge when is comes to costumography and meanings of masks and avatars in the world of theater.  However, her own art at this point doesn’t have much to do with the theater – what Sengl creates is bizarre, paradoxical, but nevertheless humorous. Her portrayal of human virtues and vices through a peculiar kind of animal masquerade is having many references in literature and history, making her work multidisciplinary and dynamic.   For her debut installation called The Last Days of Mankind, inspired by Karl Kraus’ stage version of the satire with the same name, Sengl used around 200 stuffed rats , in 44 separate installation scenes. The exhibition is closely connected with the 100th anniversary of the First World War and Kraus’s satire captured the absurdity and cruelty of the war so precisely that Viennese artist decided to use his writing as  a reference. She is representing and reinterpreting scenes in the Kraus’ work, especially dialogues, by her installation with rats and additional drawings and paintings. The scenes include streets and courts, hospitals and battlefields. Her work is an artistic interpretation of Kraus’ writing even though modern issues are also present in her pieces. Kraus was more of a starting point for the artist, from which her own elaborate projects continued to develop. I actually always portray only what I experience, what I see in our time, in our society. I don’t invent any extras. Neither did Karl Kraus, said the artist about her debut installation.   The artist is working with a taxidermist who prepares the rat skins based on her meticulous choices. Sengl decided to use rats as a metaphor for people because she finds them similar to humans in the sense that they are quite selfish animals who think of themselves first. She didn’t pay attention only to her protagonists which are rats, but she also carefully designed small objects such as flags, newspapers, furniture or jewellery, to make her main characters more lively and recognisable. In addition to The Last Days of Mankind, her other important projects were Zebralion from 2003 and Home Story from 2015. Zebralion is dealing with our obsession with brands products and our need and search for material gratification. This is also the artist's criticism of consumerism, which is bringing us a fake, deceptive sense of safety, dangerous for the overall functionality of the society. In her another series, Home Story, Sengl is telling stories about the strong contrast between luxurious lifestyle and horrible poverty, which are both equally present categories in our world. She is giving an artistic commentary about the lifestyle of those who live at the fringes of society and also about those who are addicted to material goods. She is again using animal forms, such as skulls or stuffed heads in these series – mostly cows and pigs, which again have a strong symbolic value.   The artist's innovative works offer unique, tongue-in-cheek commentary on our society and universal issues such as consumerism, poverty, identity crises and self-esteem. By her clever and audacious usage of stuffed animals, Sengl is, in a way, retelling the fables about basic human values we were told in our childhood. But now we have this special treat of being able to enjoy her dramatic fables for the adults, told by a dozen of various carefully prepared, sometimes eerie but also humorous, animal characters. The artist is represented by Lisabird Contemporary.  ",1825

Eric Joyner,"Robots have been a popular topic ever since the golden age of science fiction in the 40s and 50s when Isaac Asimov wrote his imaginative novels on robots and their code of conduct and initiated the innovative issue of artificial intelligence. For Eric Joyner, an American painter and professional illustrator, robots have been the major inspiration throughout his career and his entire body of work is dedicated to various sorts of old-school tin creatures. His characters are similar to legendary R2D2 from Star Wars or more recent star of the robot world, Pixar’s Wall-E. Joyner’s work is quite straightforward, narrative and realistic with a refreshing pop & sci-fi twist.   Joyner was born in a suburb of San Francisco and he describes his childhood as quite uneventful. He was spending his time reading comics, playing sports, collecting toys as well as drawing and painting. Already as a child, Joyner was interested in eminent painters such as Van Gogh and decided to take painting lessons. When he was in the first grade, his classmates and teachers started to notice his talent and even some of his early artworks got significant awards. Encouraged and inspired by his instant success, Joyner decided to study visual arts at the Academy of Art in San Francisco. After the graduation, Joyner began working as a commercial illustrator and created the covers for several video games. His interest in sci-fi topics became much more prominent by 1999 when Joyner decided to base his art on his childhood hobby and never forgotten passion, which were Japanese toy robots. The other recurring motif in his art, donuts, showed up a little bit later after Joyner felt that he needs one more distinctive, key element in his work. Inspired by the movie Pleasantville and the scene in which one of the characters is painting donuts, Joyner introduced donuts to his already unique and fanciful sci-fi compositions. The result turned out to be quite successful, a little bit bizarre but above all visually appealing.   When it comes to creating his pieces, Joyner is usually inventing a unique visual concept first. Later on, he does some research if necessary, followed by taking photos of his tin toys and creating sketches based on the photos. He uses a baltic birch as his canvas and paints it with gesso before transferring the drawing onto it. Even though he uses oil colors as his main medium, he always makes an underpainting in acrylics, to make sure everything is at the right place before working on the final version of his piece. Joyner’s routine is well-planned and strategic, just like his paintings, which are highly detailed and precise, yet infinitely playful and able to bring the viewer back to the early childhood days and the unforgotten magic of old-school entertainment. Also, it is interesting to observe the relationship between robots and donuts in Joyner’s work. The donuts are represented as both objects of desire and enemies of the robots and there are constant fights and chases going on between them. At the same time, no one is represented as the definite, final winner in this hilarious war and the circle of fighting goes on and on, shown in numberless colorful scenarios. This is the reason why Joyner's paintings are highly dynamic and always fun to look at.   Before concentrating on robots and donuts, Joyner was painting San Francisco urbanscapes, various cartoons characters, and Mexican masks. He chose to focus on the tin robots not only because they were one of the trendy topics at the time but also because he felt that robots would introduce a lot of possibilities and novelties when it comes to the diversity of scenes and characters, especially after he added the motif of donuts. By 2007, Joyner already entered many juried shows, had more than 20 solo and group exhibitions and his work was getting much more public exposure. At the same time, his paintings were becoming more complex and he started to depict huge, hilarious battle scenes, resembling the action frames in thrillers or sci-fi movies.   Joyner’s paintings went viral after being used in the famous TV show The Big Bang Theory. Also, the adaptation of his artworks Collator and Submerged got featured on the album cover of the Ben Folds Five’s The Sound of the Life of the Mind, which brought Joyner an outstanding media recognition. His humorous and light-hearted style which isn’t overly concerned with pressing social or political topics appeals to versatile audiences – to those who were growing up at the time of early sci-fi books as well as those raised on Japanese and Western modern animation. Beyond a long list of gallery exhibits, Joyner's work has been used in films, computer games, books and humorous commercials.  The artist is represented by Corey Helford Gallery.  ",1827
BK FOXX,"BK FOXX is an animal lover who works as a street artist in New York city. Her mission is to raise the awareness on animal treatment and their rights. The artist works on large surfaces and uses spray paint and brush work to portray beautiful creatures in their natural habitat, whether that would be a puma living in the wild, or a house cat posing her cat bed. She is a truly kindred spirit to her wildlife beings and she engages the viewer to feel and to become one with the painted animals. The accent is on the importance of caring and looking after the ones we share our planet with.  BK are the initials of her given name, and BK Foxx is a street wanderer, an artistic persona, whose soul is full of love and caring for all the living spirits of the world. She expresses her opinion visually and shows how important it is to be fully aware that living things have their own soul, their spirit, or anima. Her goal is to paint as much as possible and to work on things that move people, that mean something, that have an impact. The artist didn't go to art school, she is completely self-taught. The combination of amazing talent and hard work and some social media activity lead her to the top of New York contemporary street art scene.   BK Foxx paints animals, domestic and wild, jellyfish, but also urban motifs that depict the culture she lives in. She tries to choose items with a wide range of potential meaning, so the symbols she uses induce universal, yet unique interpretation, depending on the viewer. Her first gallery exhibition was at Woodward Gallery and it benefited the World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) for the cause of preserving natural animal habitats and reducing extinction threats. Her glorious animal kingdom is rich in color and texture. The artist worked in the studio and created a rich collection of animals and family portraits. In family portraits, the pet owners posed with their companions.   Her mission is to inspire people to think about their own personal values and how they treat their loving ones. The planet is big enough for all of its living creatures, and it is of great importance to do everything that is in our power to stop the pollution and reduce the damage that has already been done to nature reserves and wildlife. Along with animals, she paints wonderful and inspirational images of life, imagination, cosmos and material objects that have personal sentimental value or could be a cultural reference. She mixes street style motifs and pop culture tokens and creates her wonderful world of living spirits. The artist is represented by Woodward Gallery.

Audrey Flack,"Although quite heterogeneous, unpredictable and often surreal, the work of Audrey Flack is strongly rooted in the focal examination of perception. During her several decades-long career, the artist has established herself as one of the pioneers of the genre of photorealism and has produced a notable number of abstract works. Primarily governed by her own fancy and intuition, Flack has carefully departed from the canons of then popular genres in order to manage her own authentic expression. With great effort, patience, and immense courage the artist has struggled to sought her agenda out and express how limitless her creativity is.  Audrey Flack was born in 1931 in New York. She attended High School of Music & Art and studied fine arts in New York from 1948 to 1953, studying under Josef Albers among others. Afterward, from the Cooper Union in New York City the artist has earned a graduate degree and received an honorary doctorate and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Yale University. Flack even collected art history diploma at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. In May 2015, Flack received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Clark University, where she also gave a commencement address. The artist is an honorary professor at George Washington University, and currently is a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania.   During her studies, Flack was apparently dazzled by the current of Abstract Expressionist. One of the paintings produced was an homage to Franz Kline. Nevertheless, during the late 1950s, Flack decided to depart from the Abstract Expressionist aesthetic since she felt did not communicate effectively or clearly with viewers. That transition can be marked as a crucial point of transition. Then Flack enrolled at the Art Students League to study anatomy with Robert Beverly Hale because she thought her ability to paint in a realistic manner was inadequate. But gradually, she became a New Realist and then evolved into photorealism during the 1960s.   From the time stance, Audrey Flack is best known for her photorealist paintings. The fascination with the real, everyday objects is without a doubt reminiscent of Pop Art, but the genre of photorealism was practically based on exploring the matter of perception. Therefore, Flack's work depicted everyday household items like tubes of lipstick and, most commonly, fruit in almost blurry fashion, in order to undermine the enticing line between reality and fantasy. The innovation was using photographs as the foundation of her work. Besides paintings of vernacular objects which were the commentary on the construction of femininity, that method led to paintings fulfilled with sociopolitical commentary.   The early 1970s marked the beginning of Flack’s mature body of work. For example, a significant painting from this period, Farb Family Portrait (1969–70), was the result of a new working technique. The base of the work was a slide of the family portrait which was projected onto the canvas to use as her guide for painting. Such a method spared her from making preliminary drawings. Flack also developed a method of applying paint in layers with an airbrush. Besides portrayals, the artist released a number of still life paintings which reflected her fascination with Baroque, especially the notorious vanitas, collections of objects symbolic of the inevitability of death.   The 80’s brought yet another transformation of Flack’s work. The focus from painting, which was her primary media, was shifted to sculpture. The artist started exploring iconographic and mythological representations of goddesses which were inclined in feminist agenda. By evoking such a narrative, Flack tended to accentuate the female principle and ancient traditions of matriarchy. Her new trajectory led to many public commissions for her artwork. In 1986 Flack published Art & Soul: Notes on Creating, a book expressing some of her thoughts on being an artist.   The notable work’s of Audrey Flack are displayed in several major museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The artist was the first photo-realist painter to be added to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in 1966. During her career, Flac was awarded several in occasions and the most important are the St. Gaudens Medal from the Cooper Union, and the honorary Albert Dome professorship from Bridgeport University. The domains of Audrey Flak’s art are immense, she has influenced generations of artists (the ironic kitsch themes in her early work profoundly influenced Jeff Koons) and contributed not only to the art history but to feminism as well.

Bradley Theodore,"Bradley Theodore mixes art and fashion. Fashion allows people to show how they really feel and how they would like to be perceived by others. When people dress up they want to present themselves in an art form, whether that is flamboyant style, glamor or kitsch, or just casual street style, it is all part of expressing identity. That was the leading idea for Theodore when he started painting fashion icons and designers in colorful and impressionistic manner. He portrays fashion legends, such as Anna Wintour, Kate Moss or Karl Lagerfeld in Mexican Cinco de Mayo style. However, skeletons have more to do with the disclosure of the real human nature, than it has to do with folklore and symbolism.  He studied at School of Visual arts in New York and graduated with BA. He mostly focused on drawing and design, although his major was computer graphics. While he was growing up he had to struggle with issues of race, poverty, gangs and ghettos in New York. He did not let the inconvenient circumstances stop him, and he worked hard to pursue his dreams. When he portrays famous people from the fashion industry, he does it in an impressionistic method, mimicking the style of Mexican folk art. Using skulls and bones he wants to show, that under all the fancy attire lies an ordinary man or women.   The artist started out with vector art and motion graphics. At the time, he felt that it took him a bit far away from the personal feeling of art, so he decided to focus more on his inner self and he picked up the paintbrush and ditched the computer tools. He made most of his work on the streets and he prefers to create there, so he could affect the wider range of people. Even though he is a favorite in the gallery and high fashion world, he still remains humble, with his two feet firmly on the ground, and his mind always focused on deeper contemplations. He chose to make skeletons his theme, as he focuses on depth, structure, and essence.    His technique consists of making rough outlines in calm and repetitive manner, that sets the perfect beginning for both mental activity required for painting, and the details that he has to achieve by brushwork. Theodore, the interesting person himself, likes to meet other interesting people, and those encounters challenge him and inspire him. When he paints, he likes to paint not portraits, but conversations that people are having, a dream they are dreaming, emphasizing their favorite and distinctive details. When it is a single person portrayed it is about inner monolog. Historical figures and celebrities are stripped to the bone in Theodore's paintings and murals. From famous artists to celebrities like Kanye, Justin Bieber, and Skrillex, he tries to show what people are really made of. His work is showing us that underneath the body lies the soul with a story to tell.  ",1833
Ellen Carey,"Basing her work on the complete contradictions, Ellen Carey creates lens-based art in a context of abstraction and minimalism. The usual imagery of the photographs is replaced with imagined, chemically created colors, with the use or light or no light. Mixing the conventional practice with experimental processes, her inventive techniques create colors and its combinations never seen before. For the past three decades, Carey uses the large format Polaroid 20 x 24 camera that reflects her creative efforts and strivings in expression in artistic medium highly regarded for its technical advances. Unlike the traditional photography where both process and invention are transparent and equally important, in her work the process becomes the subject seen in the final object.   Her early work, Painted Self-Portraits (1978), first exhibited at Hallwalls, an alternative art space, launched her into the world of avant-garde. In 1983, The Polaroid Artists Support Program invited her to work in their studio. Carey’s pioneering series The Pull (1996) and Rollback (1997) named her practice Photography Degree Zero (1996-2016). Exploring the minimalistic and abstract images with Polaroid technology with innovative approach of using only light or none, emphasizing zero. Following the same aesthetics, she also creates photograms, photograph works made without camera. The series Struck by Light (1992-2016) represents her final concept of the less-is-more rule and consist of photograms that makes parallel practice with the Polaroid lens-based Photography Degree Zero.    The Photography Degree Zero images have no subject or any reference to a place or object. They are created with camera, in studio, but without the use of darkroom. She remained faithful to her large-format Polaroid 20 x 24 camera that she has used since 1983, and whose new possibilities she discovered thirteen years later. It has been represented in artworks Pulls and Rollbacks. Carey's visual breakthrough and creative innovation introduces the visual form called parabola as a conical loop, or a hyperbola, the shape seen in the nature, for example, in the frontal curve of a comet. Struck by Light, series of photograms, are not studio-based, but made in a darkroom, with the exclusive use of light upon exposure. Literally and figuratively Struck by Light, these images are the embodiment of her photogram research. Carey started with a reductive palette of black and white, successively adding warm tones and muted color. Using the light in a combination of photographic color theory, she incorporates unconventional objects, metal push pins, glass marbles or photographic grey card, to interrupt the light beam that strikes the paper. All Carey’s photograms in the color darkroom are light-tight, i.e. no light (zero again) allowed except upon exposure; literally blind, without sight, she introduces an aporia to our notions in photography and its camera vision.   Creating the work that consist of conceptually connected elements posted through visual characteristics as shadows and shapes seen in the object as negative, Carey considers the formal issues of size and scale conjoined with color palette. The content echoes in her choices of method and material asserting the symbols and signs that give the deeper meaning to her art. Themes on love and loss, seen in her monumental Mourning Wall (2000) and her new project To Paris with Love are captured in the large format Polaroid grey negatives. Monochrome palette of black, white and gray have a conceptual value putting the images into to specific context. Carey’s work has been exhibited in numerous solo and group shows and also is a part of the permanent collections of over twenty museums. ",1834
Emanuele Ravagnani,"Being a versatile artist isn’t always easy. There is an ever-present danger of over-saturating your pieces with different techniques that don't always go along. Emanuele Ravagnani is an Italian contemporary artist, who has mastered several techniques. He makes the best out of painting (from oil-based paints to natural pigments), material assembly and collage, black and white photographs that the artist himself develops in a darkroom, to objects recovering. Producing big and medium sized artworks on canvas, with lines defining utopian architectures hidden by a haze of color, Ravagnani’s chosen territory veers on graphics. Sometimes clear and recognizable, sometimes blurred and hidden, his trait is the creative tension of the shapes, seemingly carved in the high density of color meant as matter. The shapes spread in a chaotic and cryptic connection with language and numerology, inciting the viewers to seek for mysterious relations between signs, figures, and space.  Since he plays bass guitar and contrabass, the music, fundamental in his visual language, expresses itself in two ways; firstly, it’s a big deal, conceptually speaking, with numerous references to important musicians who have left their marks on the history of jazz and avant-garde music; and secondly, working experimentally, through sculptures and installations created by using old and recovered instruments, welded metals, and a series of saved gears and wheels which move and play different instruments, such as keyboards, drums, and guitars. Ravagnani uses electronic music as well, through bases and synthesized sounds, created specifically to serve as a base for videos.   Despite being young (born in 1989) and having recently graduated from the Accademia delle Belle Arti of Brera, Milano (2013), Ravagnani is a busy artist, who’s been included in a number of successful group exhibitions. He’s also had several equally successful and critically acclaimed solo shows, with the most recent being the Untitled, which was organized by Molin Corvo Gallery and held at Spazio Folli 50.0, Milano in 2015. The opening of the show was accompanied by a small musical performance with a video projection. In 2014, the artist was a finalist of the 6th edition of Nocivelli prize, held at the church of Disciplina di Verolanuova and sponsored by the municipality of Brescia. Currently, Ravagnani is working on a project that’ll feature a set of works, video, photography and paintings resulting from spending several months in an abandoned factory where he patiently gathered sounds, images, and emotions to be rewritten and transposed in his work.  He is represented by Molin Corvo Gallery.  ",1835
Kensuke Koike,"Through juggling, ripping, disassembling and then reassembling photographs, a Japanese artist Kensuke Koike creates new images with their own independent lives, just barely connected with their previous ones. As he constantly searches for a perfect image processing that would ultimately lead to a perfect collage, the artist slowly becomes an alchemist who uses everyday materials, turning them into artistic gold, showing that everything depends on our point of observation of reality and the way in which we take into consideration.    Arguably, his most famous pieces are the diamond shaped collages. He chose this particular shape because it is a widely recognizable symbol, but also because of the memorial diamonds, made from the ashes of departed loved ones. Indistinguishable from the actual stones, they possess a value much greater to their owners. Koike knows that the value here isn’t economical, and if the diamond is artificial, the emotions it causes are certainly honest. A precious stone can be pretty much ruined by a bad, faulty cut, losing its monetary value – this is also true for Koike’s work on paper. Once again, the idea that a man’s ability determinates the object’s value is proven axiomatic; otherwise, a diamond would be just an ordinary stone, and a collage would simply be a piece of paper. Speaking of his process applied in all his works, the composition of the collage sees the exclusive application of fragments of the same photograph. Challenging the objectivity of the photographic product, Koike’s subjects regain possession of a soul that lives only in the fantasies of the viewer. Through his work, he always wanted to see and unravel the birth of imagination, and this fantastic trait is so characteristic for many of his artworks.   Born in Nagoya, Japan, Koike moved to Italy, pursuing studies. He graduated from Accademia di Belle Arti, Venice, Italy in 2004, and he spent the next three years further expanding his knowledge at the IUAV University, Faculty of Arts and Design in Venice. Since 2005, he has actively exhibited his works, mainly in Italy, but also in Germany, the USA, Canada and Slovenia, first as a part of group shows, and later having his own successful solo shows. In 2015, Koike introduced his most recent opus in a publication entitled Over Their Dead Bodies. Inspired by the photographs of two group portraits that he saw at a flea market, the artist wanted to find out why there were eight women in the first photo and only six in the other. The six women from the second picture were also in the first, though he had some troubles recognizing them. Intrigued to discover what happened to the other two, what was the relationship between all of them, Koike took an adventurous journey that culminated in the beautiful publication. Since the photographs were very old (from WWI), there was no doubt that the characters were long deceased, and with the people were also gone their stories and memories. Now, the artist has allowed us to use our own imagination, so we can grant them new stories. He is represented by A plus A gallery.  ",1836

Lu Hong,"Forming his earliest artistic beginnings during the period of China’s oppressive Cultural Revolution, Lu Hong had a luck that regime’s dictate was about to end. The visit of his uncle, already famous painter, Ting Shao Kuang at decisive moment changed his life direction. He helped him to enter the most prestigious art school in country, the Central Academy of Design and Arts in Beijing, followed by a scholarship to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and to reach the United States where he could freely express his visual language formed on the influences of artists like Paul Klee, Modigliani, and Picasso.  Lu Hong was born in 1959, in Qin Huangdao, a city on the coast of northeastern China. He graduated high school in 1981 when his uncle Ting Shao Kuang helped him to realize his dream. Kuang was one of the leaders of already internationally-known Chinese art movement of Yunnan School. Also persecuted by the communist authorities, he eventually left the country and asked Hong to join him in 1986. Liberated of any fears, the artist could finally enjoy his inspirations, masters of European contemporary art and music of Chopin, Mueller and Wagner he admired the most. Hong is best known for his multi-faceted paintings on rice paper, a very delicate technique that includes the use of different water-based mediums, as watercolor and gouache, Japanese mineral and Chinese stone paints. His cautiously applied lines form drawing on rice paper sheets that are affiliated with liquid acrylic and placed on the painting board.   After his great introduction at Segal Fine Art during the New York Art Expo and Los Angeles Art Expo in 1987, where he showed his works infused by Western inspiration with his distinctive traditional technique, Lu Hong has become one of the most acclaimed contemporary Chinese painters worldwide. His paintings have been exhibited in Japan, France, Netherlands, Taiwan and Canada and the United States, and published in numerous publications and famous magazines, such as The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, China Daily News, and L.A. Weekly among the others.",1840
Nanami Cowdroy,"Under the influences of her Japanese-European heritage, Nanami Cowdroy juxtaposes foreign and familiar making illustrations that are products of her exotic imagination. Using the pen and ink techniques she depicts strong and deep compositions characteristic for her monochrome palette and recognizable for the signature in Japanese characters stamped in red (Nanami means “Seven Seas” in Japanese). Intertwined detailed objects and composite characters are often connected to the pattern of contradicting elements, such as urban landscapes and underwater creatures or technology and nature, creating the fantastical world of art.  Cowdroy was born in Sydney, Australia but she frequently visited her mother’s family in Tokyo that highly influenced her early creative development. Coming from an artistic family, that naturally became a part of her commitment and future career. Her mother was an Ikebana teacher whose floral arrangements were very inspirational for a curious young girl and her father’s ancestry refers to the painters, writers, and designers. On their home walls were hung oil paintings of Australian landscapes beside Japanese Ukiyo-E woodblock prints and Sumi-E scrolls of bamboo, photos of Sydney in the same frames with Mount Fuji and hand-made clay vases from the Blue Mountains together with the images of cherry blossoms.   One of the most dominant elements in her work is fishes and water creatures that she admires since she was a child. Thanks to the good memory and vivid dreams, the artist easy finds the material and inspiration for her works. Depicting origami Tsuru (paper cranes), a symbol of peace and longevity, she remembers her grandmother who taught her how to make these paper creations. Having a problem with patience, but also hand and eye coordination, she found more convenient to transfer the origami pieces onto her drawn works. According to an old tale, whoever folds a thousand cranes, will have their heart’s wish come true. She combines her black and white palette with the shades of gray on a white paper.   Growing up in contrasting cultures, the artist considers her childhood as a formative factor. Through her illustrative style and mixed media compositions, she strives to stay true to her artistic instincts. Trying not to do preparing sketches, her final work is a reproduction of things she sees in her mind and a kind of visual evidence of her thoughts and feelings. Encouraged and inspired by disorder, the driving force of her creative expression is in detail that gives her great sense of freedom and possibility to make hidden things, seen only if looks closely enough. Her work has been exhibited in numerous group and solo shows in Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. She collaborated with global brands such as Smirnoff and Nissan Micra, creating characteristic design for their products. ",1841
Yang She Wei,"Focusing on different kind of problems that affect people, Yang She Wei questions life circumstances that lead us to have certain expectations from the others. During the times when the world seems preoccupied with countless relevant and irrelevant information, others’ issues and global problems, the identity of individual becomes unnoticed. People get used to being guided by their own prejudices, not having time to think about things they see. The artist explores the narratives behind the visual, encouraging the viewer to find the truth hidden in the deeper meaning.  Yang She Wei is born in 1971. He graduated with Bachelor of Fine Arts from Hubei Institute of Fine Arts and with Master of Fine Arts from Xu Beihong Art College of the Renmin University of China in 1995. Connecting traditional and modern, he uses China ink and color on rice paper to depict contemporary themes full of content and questions. Have the women become the victims of their own fight for emancipation? They are in a constant struggle to achieve something, from education and gainful employment to perfect partner and normal family, often losing their own individuality, bringing the bitterness in everything they do. Wei’s Bikini series explores the negative effect of social expectations and pressure for woman to constantly strives for more. The same vulnerability is seen on the faces of his characters from the Opera series, where the artist puts an accent on their expressions beneath the masks. He tried to point out the situation of the Chinese opera singers who are sometimes forced to play several roles at the same time. Instead of glorious and respectable persons they should be, these performers work hard for little money and insufficiently recognition in today’s world.     Discussing the ever-present dilemmas in the modern, urban lives, Wei’s works reveal raw emotion of his subjects through the masterful use of ink and color technique. He has exhibited in couple of solos and numerous group exhibitions and his works are collected by a number of museums and institutions in China including Today Art Museum, Beijing, Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, Chengdu, Guan Shanyue Art Museum, Shenzhen, Hubei Museum of Art, Wuhan and Lingnan Museum of Fine Art, Guangzhou and private collectors in Hong Kong, China and overseas.

Tian Xu Tong,"If we had to choose three words to describe paintings by Tian Xu Tong, we would definitely choose calmness, simplicity and peace. These words wouldn’t be chosen accidentally as the Chinese artist creates paintings influenced by his interest in Zen philosophy and the Song Dynasty, a culturally rich and sophisticated age for his native country when ink painting became an important and popular genre. His meditating monks represent the stillness, perfection and co-existence with the totality of all things Zen. Using brushstrokes that seem bold and spontaneous, his paintings resonate simplicity but also reflect the meanings of peace and universality.   Tian Xu Tong found a great source of inspiration in the way sagacious monks live their lives: the simplicity of their lives, the concentration, tranquility, and mindfulness of every activity, the calm and peace they find in their days. They are often depicted while meditating on boats on water or on mountain tops illuminated by the sun's or moon’s light in plain, abstracted space. His paintings remind us that in today's world of ever-increasing responsibility and pressure, we all need to slow down, stop rushing, and enjoy the simple wonders of life.   Born in 1962, Tian Xu Tong graduated from the Central Academy of Craft and Design in Beijing in 1985 with a major in ink painting.

Fajari was born in 1980 in Singapore where he completed his studies earning the Master of Arts and Fine Arts diploma at LASALLE College of the Arts in 2007. His artworks, from illustrations to graffiti, expose his personality, taste for music, inner thoughts and doubts. Influenced by fanzines, the hand-made magazines very popular in underground circles before the arrival of the Internet, Speak Cryptic is recognizable for his uncommon style that means implementation of black and white lines with the use of Chinese ink and small brush when he paints over the walls. A great fun of rock and metal music particularly bands Fugazi and Meshuggah, his characters often have heads of rockers and punkers, resembling the characteristic portrait of the young people who live in Singapore.

He participated in the Venice Biennale in 1954, 1974, 1978, 1993, 2003, 2013 and 2015, and to dOCUMENTA(13) in Kassel in 2012. Mauri’s art addresses themes of communication and manipulation, bringing light to the 'political dimension of the image,' as it is projected and proliferated throughout contemporary society. Several important themes can be found in Mauri’s work - the Screen, the Prototypes, the Projections, the Photography as Painting, the substantial Identity of Expressive Structures, the lasting relationship between Thought and World and between Thought as World.

Genieve Figgis,"Irish artist Genieve Figgis in her work, explores images from art history, that of the French pre-revolutionary Rococo period, and transforms them into figurative abstraction. The ever-present dark humor stands in contrast with faceless subjects as they lounge about in lavish environments. Her work, full of vibrant color, texture, and macabre, questions the idealization of luxury seen throughout art history. Today Figgis' works, which fetches six-figure prices, belong in a number of private and public collections, including the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Smart Museum in Chicago, the Consortium Museum, the X Museum, and the Arts Council of Ireland. Figgis (born 1972), from a young age, wished to be an artist, but she was able to realize that dream in her 30s when she began studying at Gorey School of Art, Wexford. After graduating with a BA in Fine Art, the artist studied at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, where she earned an MFA in 2012. Figgis was discovered by fellow artist Richard Prince who saw her painting Lady with a bird (2013) on Twitter and wished to buy it. Thanks to his support and the introduction to the New York art scene, she quickly gained wide recognition.   Genieve Figgis had her first solo exhibition in the US entitled Yes, Captain (2014) at Harpers Books in East Hampton. In four years since her work first appeared at an auction, the artist has generated more than $10 million in sales. The critics often compare her work to the dramatic bent of such masters as Francisco Goya, Édouard Manet, Diego Velázquez, George Condo, and Karen Kilimnik. Working with acrylic and oil, the artist has developed a technique in which she pores the paint directly onto canvas and lets the pull of gravity create the bleeding of colors. The blurring of faces and the zombie-like feel of the subjects emulate the portraits of the bourgeoisie enjoying their wealthy homes. The grotesque aspects of the faces transform the lush portraits and landscapes into scenes that seem to have come straight out of horror. In the Pink Couch (2015), the subject wearing pink seems to be disappearing and melting into the pink Victorian furniture creating a nightmarish atmosphere. Much of the artist's fascination with Rococo and Romanticism comes from growing up in a household full of replicas from that time. Besides trying to recreate the pre-revolutionary world, the artist, through her work, features many powerful women ""who are playing the role and having fun themselves."" Figgis' recent exhibitions include Immortal Reflection (2021) and Salon de Peinture (2021) in New York, Un Hiver à Paris (2021) in Paris, and Wish you were here (2018) at Almine Rech Gallery in Paris. The artist also published a book entitled Making Love With the Devil in 2014. She has exhibited in New York, Copenhagen, Paris, London, Dublin, and Brussels. Genieve Figgis lives and works in County Wicklow, Ireland. ",1857

Yigal Ozeri,"Yigal Ozeri is an Israeli artist based in New York City, best known for photo-realistic depictions of young women juxtaposed against colorful landscapes. By carefully portraying the sensuousness of youth, the artist explores the notion of female archetype while evoking the ancient traditions of feminine cults and Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics. The muses in his works are presented as if focused on their self-exploration, freed of the male gaze; these images are saturated with ambiguity since they are simultaneously evoking hope, freedom, and love of life, as well as a sort of melancholy.

Jose Davila,"A contemporary Mexican artist, Jose Dávila reflects on the failure of utopian, modernist architectural principles in his assemblages, mixed-media works, photography and installations. Drawing from the symbolic languages that function within art history and Western visual culture, he reconfigures them as contradictory and contrasting relations, taking the correspondence between form and content to its limit. Dávila is born in in 1974 in Guadalajara, Mexico, Dávila where he currently lives and works. He studied Sculpture at Academia de Bellas Artes, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico Architecture at ITESO, Guadalajara, Mexico.

Roberto Burle Marx,"Brazilian artist Roberto Burle Marx was a landscape artist, painter, musician, printmaker, ecologist, and naturalist. World-renowned for his exceptional designs of parks and gardens of which he designed nearly 3000, he is accredited with having introduced modernist landscape architecture to Brazil. Burle Marx collaborated with several architecture masters, including Oscar Niemeyer and Le Corbusier. Marx's work is so bellowed by people around the world that when New York Botanical Garden organized his solo exhibition it was a major success, attracting over 240,000 visitors.   Born in São Paulo in 1909, Marx moved to Rio de Janeiro with his family in 1913. He was first drawn to landscaping after visits to the Botanical Garden in Berlin during his studies. Upon returning to Brazil in 1930, he began collecting plants in and around his home. He studied at the National School of Fine Arts in Rio in 1930, where he focused on visual arts under Leo Putz and Cândido Portinari. During his studies, he associated with several of Brazil's future leaders in architecture and botanists, including his professor, Brazilian Modernism's Lucio Costa, the architect, and planner. He taught landscape architecture at the University of Brazil and wrote a number of essays. In 1938 Marx received his first major commission by the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro. The work was a groundbreaking success, for he changed the usual style of his contemporaries. He forgo the static architectural design and succeeded in creating a visual flow by introducing texture and strong colors. By the 1950s, the artist began to incorporate geometrical forms into the gardens’ compositions.   Drawing on a wide range of cultural and natural references, Marx explored an anti-mimetic and skeptical aesthetic developed from modernism with a distinctly Brazilian style. Considering himself foremost a painter, he treated his landscapes as works of art, utilizing bold combinations of massed plantings and colorful amorphous paving patterns as his palette. Yet, he always sought to control nature by merging his artistic training with horticultural skills. All Marx’s designs show a strong affinity for abstract art, which he achieved by incorporating sculptures, mosaics, walkaways, and water. Also, the artist had an exceptional eye and skill for recognizing the value of the sculptural form of plants.  Throughout his life, Marx was a strong advocate for the preservation of Amazon rain forests and always tried to incorporate exotic native flora in garden design.   Burle Marx designed gardens in various countries, including Brazil, France, Washington D.C., South Africa, Los Angeles, and Argentina. Among his most prominent designs is the Sítio Roberto Burle Marx that served as his private garden, where he cultivated a vast number of tropical plants. Today, it is under the protection of UNESCO, not only for its design but also for its immense importance for environmental preservation. As a prolific painter, Marx had his first exhibition in 1941, and from there on, continued to exhibit throughout national and international salons. Burle Marx died in 1994 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Frank Bowling,"Throughout his career, Richard Sheridan Franklin Bowling OBE RA LG, better known as Frank Bowling, pushed the possibilities of painting through a sensual use of color and bold experimentation. His distinct painting practice has been defined by an integration of autobiography and postcolonial geopolitics into abstraction. Born in Bartica, Guyana, Bowling moved to England in1950, at the age of 19, where he lived with an uncle and completed his education. He first studied at the Chelsea School of Art, and then in 1959 won a scholarship to London's Royal College of Art, alongside artists such as David Hockney, Derek Boshier, Allen Jones, R. B. Kitaj and Peter Phillips. There, he graduated with a silver medal. His work evolved from figurative pop art to huge abstract canvases with colors and textures that draw the viewer in. Tirelessly exploring the material of paint, he continuously invented new techniques that pushed the medium to its limits. His visionary approach fuses abstraction with personal memories. Being a black artist in Britain, Bowling only really began to get the recognition he deserved when his paintings were included in a group show during the 2003 Venice Biennale. In 2019, his first major retrospective was held at Tate Britain, a first for a black British artist. ",1878

The masterfully created interplay between light and shadows gives life to the works’ two-dimensional nature and strengthens the message about the Earth’s surface. Born in Mexico City, Mareo Rodríguez was raised in Medellín, Colombia, and is currently based in Barcelona, Spain.",1881

She focuses on themes of mutability, geography and nature, seeking to unveil, and make sense of, the chaotic logic that underpins both the natural and man-made worlds.

Alec Monopoly,"Although the 20th century has seen exponential growth and discovery on the field of modern science and technology, it hasn’t been until the later part of it that we’ve seen it being used for entertainment as it is today. Often, one would turn to playing a board game for some quality spare time, and if so, Monopoly was likely the game to be played as one of the most famous of the era. The board game is widely known even today, and one artist going under the pseudonym of Alec Monopoly ironically appropriates the famous mascot that denotes financial success, criticizing the system of the billion-dollar bailouts and de-regulations associated with major banks.   Monopoly is an artist originating from New York whose identity is unknown. Following his aspiration towards graffiti, he moved to the city of Los Angeles in 2006, mainly for its many billboards that allow artists as him to work freely. Although he’s been based in LA ever since, his practice took him to Miami, New York, Europe and Asia, and his tuxedo and top-hat are instantly recognizable. The idea for the character was inspired by the stockbroker Bernie Madoff, says Monopoly, and his artistic origins come from his mother, as he had abandoned the traditional academic art in favor of individual methods. Highly aware of his surroundings, Alec Monopoly instituted a house rule of a sort: to avoid the vandalism aspect of street art. Even though it’s changing the world of art as we know it, doing graffiti is still often considered a crime and Monopoly is mindful of it. Staying clear of surfaces that include federal and government property like mailboxes, highways, and freeways, he chooses to express his artistic ways on abandoned buildings and warehouses. More so, he realizes that people who do get to see his work aren’t necessarily “graffiti people” or “art people,” and he does his part to make his art identifiable with.   His work often references the current economy status and the issues with bureaucratic hierarchies, and to portray these themes, Monopoly appropriates various pop characters and melds them in with newspaper clippings. Using various materials including stencils, spray paint, varnishes, and newspapers, he merges Pop art with social commentary and cultural criticism, leaving up to the viewers to decide whether he is against capitalism, or if he’s embracing it. Using the urban environments of New York City, Los Angeles, and London as his canvas, he’s achieved international renown, working on projects like The W Hotel, Vitamin Water, Avicii, and CoverGirl.   Although we may not know his identity, his character and graffiti works make as vivid a statement. Appropriating the mascot of the board game as his signature sign, his work brings to the forefront the issue of American collective consciousness and reminds of what the board game was meant to demonstrate: an economical surrounding in which monopolists work with few constraints is worse than the one rewarding wealth creation. Having Banksy as a role-model and Mr. Brainwash as a mentor, his artwork is some of the most wanted on the current art market, bringing together visual aesthetics and social awareness.  ",1891
David Choe,"David Choe is an American painter, muralist and urban graffiti artist who raise to fame when he painted murals on the walls of Facebook offices in 2005. He gave his style an epithet of dirty. He often portrays explicit scenes of sexual nature, but he does it under the name of expressing true nature of the human soul. He explores the feelings of desire and lust, creativity and decadence. His style is blatant, raw and bold, and he avoids any subtlety in his painting. David Choe started painting at an early age, and one of his first works were urban street graffiti. As his style progressed so did his artistic aspirations, and from graffiti, he switched to figure painting and murals.  Choe is a creative rebel who is on a constant hunt for better quality and new inspiration. He believes in down-to-earth nature of human existence, but when it comes to art, he believes in his visions more than anything. When he was young he felt that the social injustice did more to his perception of the world and values, than it just raised anger. He felt that his anarchistic feelings separated him from his peers, but wanted to do something with all that bottled up energy.That sort of faith led him to great success, when Internet entrepreneur Sean Parker, who was a fan of Choe's work for years, invited him to paint a mural at the new office of Facebook headquarters.  He painted graphic, explicit and sexual murals, and just two years later Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ask him to paint another set of walls, just in more chaste and pure nature. Choe used a somewhat rough style, free and wild, stressing out the freedom of movement. Swirly trails of color, combined with explicit subjects of the mural, opened up the office space and gave it a new and futuristic look. Futuristic, yet raw and natural. The murals were not painted on entire walls, they were carefully positioned on the most important areas. He used his favorite motif, portraits of naked women, painted in erotic light, with exuberant energy. For some parts, he was inspired by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, and he used the superflat feature of his palette. Along with women, he painted surreal, comic figures, symbolic and fantastic, who complemented the whole idea of originality and creativity. Instead of a commission he took some stocks in the company and gained fortune through this work. The murals became an integral part of the offices and every time the company changes a location, they carry the walls with them.   David Choe comes from Korean family and he spent his childhood in Korean district of Los Angeles. As a boy, he was fascinated with comic books and graphic novels, and at the beginning of 90's he began painting his first graffiti. He joined other LA artists, Mear One and Hex and started developing his own unique style. Graffiti were important to him in more than just creative sense. They were crucial for his self-development, and even in hardest times, he managed to find light and inspiration in his drawings. His spirit animal is a buchtooth whale who became a mascot and a sort of symbolic guide, and he was and still is an essential part of many of his works. Along with the whale, came many religious motifs, especially those taken out from the Bible. What he paints can be perceived as dark and dirty yet at the same time colorful and cartoonish. The case of this polarities in his work can be justified by the nature of the human soul. The unpolished and rough parts are originating from the dark side of emotions, and the optimistic and joyful subjects are following the path of happiness. Erotic and suggestive portraits and motifs are just part of Choe's style. Dirty elements are coming from the surface of the walls since he often paints on surfaces that are already painted or the walls that are decaying and crumbling. For some of his elements, he gets motivated by random shapes and patterns he finds on walls, ceilings, that inspire him to draw the first thing that comes to his mind. Sometimes it is the random scene of erotic nature, other times it is the famous whale again.   He spent most of his teenage years living a rebellious lifestyle, but he kept his heart and mind focused on art. Choe decided to drop out of high school and to spend those years on a spiritual journey. He painted graffiti, lead a street lifestyle, and, in the nomadic style, traveled through the USA and Europe, even the Middle East and Africa. He returned to LA to enroll at the university and for two years he studied at the California College of the Arts in Oakland. After all the adventures he returned to his family house where he grew up. Choe wanted to become a comic book artist and spent many years exhibiting at various gallery shows and at a San Diego Comic-Con. He made two novels, Slow Jams in 1998, and Bruised Fruit in 2002, which are now considered as a classics of the genre. Choe embraced pop culture elements and subjects from the entertainment industry. He made movie sets for the indie film Juno and made artwork for Jay Z and Linking Park album. Before the Facebook collaboration, he exhibited his fine art paintings at various galleries but decided to hang up his works in the ice cream shop called Double Rainbow, and became very successful at the hipster districts of LA.   One life event changes his perspective of life and living. After he was arrested in Japan and spent three months in Tokyo jail, he calmed down a bit and changed his life philosophy. His art was always provocative, full of naked, erotic portraits of seductive women. Over the time, he developed a more tame style but still stayed bold and visceral. For the 2008 presidential campaign, he painted a fine art piece of Barack Obama which the president hung in the White House after the election. The subjects of his work go from profound abstractions to concrete images of vamp women, almost always portrayed in a sexual light. Choe manages to be explicit and enigmatic at the same time. Women are pictured with heavy makeup, but they still have a touch of mystery to their appearance. His hybrid technique is a mixture of dirty walls, chaotic patterns, recurring symbols and harmonious totality. It is in his nature to start out with raw and chaotic style, but also his mission as an artist to expose beauty and harmony. All the women symbolize the feeling of desire, which is often present in his murals. He likes to see himself as more than just a graffiti artist since he believes that graffiti are political and social by definition, and his murals are sometimes only entertaining and fun. However, he puts a lot of work into his murals and paintings, and when it's not political or anarchistic, his work is still spiritual. Art was a form of salvation for Choe, and he believes his life would not function normally without it.   Even though he enjoys the celebrity culture and pop-culture references, he challenges himself to explore more heartfelt dimensions of fame and creativity. What concerns him is the status of freedom and privacy in our modern times where people expose themselves to the outer world completely. In his murals, he frequently attends the topic of emotional freedom and self-evaluation. Being inspired by the show he had in Mexico in 2013, just a year after he released a book of watercolor works, called Snowman Monkey BBQ. The book was a great success and what is truly admirable in his work is the ability to paint on such diverse levels. The book has all the watercolor work he exhibited in Mexico, and all the paintings are presented neatly over the 266 pages. Not worrying about pleasing the masses, this artist continues to grow as a person and as creative professional. The artist is represented by Hang-Up Gallery and Lazarides, both from London.  ",1892
Buff Monster,"Known for his adorable one-eyed characters living in brightly colored lollipop landscapes, Buff Monster is a famous street and urban artist currently based in New York. Born in Hawaii in 1979, he began his prosperous art career making graffiti over two decades ago. In 1997, the young creative moved to Los Angeles, California where he quickly made a name for himself by putting up thousands of hand-silkscreened posters and stickers across LA. After a while, his creativity extended into many different areas, so today he also works on paintings, collectible toys and design projects. Buff Monster’s distinctive style – influenced by black metal music, ice cream and Japanese culture – is dominated by different shades of pink that he associates with confidence and individuality.[1]  Born and raised in Hawaii, Buff Monster began painting graffiti back in his early teens. At the age of seventeen, he moved to California to pursue his further education at the USC for Business Administration and Fine Art. After receiving a BA in Fine Art with a minor in business, he lived in Santa Monica for a couple of years, then, he moved to Hollywood. The history and the culture of contemporary LA along with the movie industry, the culture of image in the city, and even the porn industry on one hand, and the dirty industrial areas downtown on the other inspired artist to start putting posters on the walls across a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles.[2] The experience in painting graffiti gave him a good understanding of the fun and effectiveness of displaying works in the street.     The Hawaiian-born artist creates amazing wheat-pasted posters and colorful murals filled with cherries, breasts, ice cream and gooey cheerful monsters painted bright colors. All of his works are characterized by bubble gum pink that became his trademark over the years. When he began creating the “Buff Monster” characters, he wanted something simple, versatile and fun, but at the same time, something he would be able to draw very easily, at any scale and any proportion. So, he came up with his early creature that was versatile enough he could make a million different characters from it and draw it with a million different faces. It was everything he ever wanted, but he probably couldn’t imagine how famous his characters would become.    Originally released in 1985 by the Topps Chewing Gum company, Garbage Pail Kids is a series of trading cards designed to parody the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, which were immensely popular in the early ‘80s. Buff Monster started collecting these inspiring cards in second grade always admiring to major Garbage Pail Kids artist John Pound, who created idea sketches, pencil work, color roughs, and final paintings for hundreds of GPKs. In 2012, Buff created a high-quality homage to Pound and the iconic Topps character series through the collection of trading cards - The Melty Misfits - curated with the artist’s original work. Produced in association with Sidekick Labs, these cards are reproduced from original 5x7 acrylic and airbrush paintings - the same manner in which the original GPK work was created. The back of each card features puzzles, checklists and reproductions of pencil sketches. In 2014, the globally popular painter published The Melty Misfits series 2 featuring 41 new colorful, cartoonish gross-out characters, all hand-painted using acrylic and airbrush on watercolor paper.    The multitalented Buff has released numerous signature vinyl objects through MINDstyle, and has many other projects in the works with leading toy companies. The muralist got into making his adorable sculptures in the mid-2000s when he made a little 3-inch piece in his recognizable style. Since then, countless of these cute figures were born as he enjoyed the fact that he could make little 3D representations of the characters imagined in his mind. These pieces range from tiny Munnys to Buff's own Ice Creams based on the icon he popularized in his early career. One of the most famous pieces has been a 14-inch-high Destroyer (Embrace the Darkness Version) made in 2010. Toy Machine Toys is Buff Monster’s double machine inspired by Duchamp’s readymades and Koons’ Equilibrium and Banality series. Full of hand-cast resin figures, the piece was created in NYC in collaboration with PK Shop. The work features two different machines, each of which is filled with designs from one of two series. The first is Ice Cream Resin Heads which includes four main variations - Original, Zombie, Devil, and Skull designs, along with three rare variations - Split Devil/Zombie and 2 different Double Zombies. The second machine includes Melty Misfits Cheap Toys with three characters: Double Heather, Graffiti Petey and Alice Island.   The first book of Buff Monster’s work, Life is Sweet was published in 2009 by MINDstyle. Layed out by the man himself, the book includes images of paintings, figures, posters, installations and more – all in a style that oozes confidence and happiness. Stay Melty is his second book published in December 2015 by Gingko Press. The full-color book features 600 images of the artist’s work created between 2013 and 2015 covering everything from his paintings and murals to resin releases. It offers a unique view into Buff's amazing body of work.[3]   Over the years, New York based artist has built a virtual army of fans. His Facebook page has more than 685,000 followers while his Instagram account is followed by more than 128,000 fans. His Twitter account is followed by just 18,500 people. They are devoted to Buff’s irresistible artistic style that spread happiness and joy. His work has been included in many one-man and group exhibitions in such galleries as Corey Helford Gallery, LA, Kolly Gallery, Zurich, Thinkspace Gallery, Culver City, 101/exhibit Gallery, LA and many others. Various magazines, websites, newspapers and books wrote about his artworks, including Juxtapoz, Paper, Nylon, Cool Hunting, Angeleno, The Los Angeles Times, LA Weekly and much more. Buff was also featured in Banksy’s Oscar-nominated documentary movie Exit through the Gift Shop. Home or abroad, he still likes painting large and vibrant murals that can be found everywhere from the United States to Italy to New Zealand. He is represented by Corey Helford Gallery.

Blek le Rat,"France's capital may be the world renowned for the invaluable pieces of art that reside in such museums as the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay, but it is also home to some of the most exciting street art in Europe. One of the first artist who started decorating the streets of the City of Light was legendary graffiti artist Blek le Rat who has inspired generations of graffiti artists across the globe. The true pioneer of street art, he is often cited as a major influence of artists like Banksy, Space Invader, Shepard Fairey, and Icy and Sot. Through his work in his hometown, the artist established a style of urban art that rapidly spread throughout the continent and beyond.   The father of stencil graffiti, Xavier Prou was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, a commune in the western suburbs of Paris in 1951. He studied fine art and architecture at the prestigious École Des Beaux Arts in Paris, graduating in 1982. Before his graduation, Prou visited New York and developed a fascination with the city’s street art. Inspired by the NYC graffiti, he returned to France and began his artistic career in 1981 by painting stencils of rats. What he did that no one artist in France had was the utilization of pre-stenciled posters and images allowing the application of paint to be a lot speedier, mostly because he didn’t want to stay a long time on the streets because of the police. His black painted rats which began to appear on the street walls of the city would mark the beginning of the transformation of Paris’s visual landscape and identity. His pseudonym, Blek le Rat, originates from a childhood cartoon ""Blek le Roc"", using ""rat"" as an anagram for “art” because, for him, the rats symbolized both freedom and the spread of art throughout the city as an invasion.   In the early 80s, American artist Richard Hambleton came to Paris and brought his work over from the US. By that time, Blek was already making rats, but when he saw Hambleton’s large shadow human figures, he got the idea of making bigger pieces, so he soon began doing larger works, as well as self-portraits. Today, Blek is credited as the first to transform stencil from basic lettering into imagery, and the one to invent the life-sized stencils. He creates most of his stencils by hand, crafting each to perfection to allow for the best detail possible upon application, and works mainly in black and white.  Ten years after he made his first piece, Blek le Rat was eventually discovered and caught by the French authorities. He was charged and fined for stenciling his own version of Caravaggio's Madonna and Child onto a wall in Paris. This image is Blek le Rat’s oldest remaining artwork, and it depicts a woman called Sybille. Blek le Rat had fallen in love with Sybille and decided to proclaim his feelings to her by spray painting her image while interpreting Caravaggio’s notorious piece. Luckily, this love story has a happy ending, as Sybille and Prou are now married and have a son.  Over the years, it seems that the subject of Blek’s depictions has changed a bit – he is more focused on questions that regard social consciousness, politics, and environmental problems. He creates socially engaged artworks, intended to bring attention to global problems, often depicting marginalized individuals opposed to large oppressive groups. He has also been noted for his series of images of homeless people, begun in 2006, which depict them standing, sitting or laying on sidewalks, in attempts to bring attention to what he views as a global problem, to provoke thoughts, and even actions. Popular opinion believes that Banksy was greatly influenced by the work of Blek le Rat, which shares a similar style.   With the impressive career that spans over three decades, Blek le Rat continues to influence many street artists and to amaze us all to this day. He remains one of the most referenced artists by other artists, and his contribution to the movement is invaluable. In the past decade Blek’s popularity has become more mainstream and in 2006, Blek showed his works in London’s Leonard Street Gallery. Since then, his oeuvre has been included in numerous individual and collective shows in galleries across the globe. That doesn’t mean he has stopped the street art, his graffiti work has continued to appear throughout the world.  The French artist is represented by Vertical Gallery in London; Ministry of Walls, Cologne; Hang-Up Gallery, London; 44309 Street//art Gallery, Dortmund; Wunderkammern, Rome; Wunderkammern, Milan; Jonathan Levine Gallery, NY; and Artsuggest.com.

C215,"Many of the street artists have faced problems with the law in their careers. It’s up to each and every one of them to decide what to do when after those kinds of situations. Some change their MO, some simply give up, some come out stronger and with more determination. When you choose the number of a jail cell you were locked in as your moniker, you are clearly making a statement. Christian Guémy chose C215 as his moniker, and rose to become one of the most famous stencil artists in the world. Since he’s been active for more than 20 years, he is considered to be a veteran, and one of the top ones still in the game.  Christian was born in Paris, and his first stencil work was put up in 2005, but he has been a graffiti artist for over 20 years. C215's favorite topic is portrait, as faces have a universal message that everybody will understand and be moved by. But ""In the end, behind the portraits, the question is always freedom and dignity in the face of a capitalist daily life system"", as he claims. His striking portraits of local people, children and especially his daughter Nina are expressive and distinctive in style. With his subjects always portrayed as proud and dignified, his images communicate on a universal level and draw attention to those that society has forgotten about. He paints, draws, and makes stencils, and he truly enjoys painting in the streets. The technique makes it possible to paint beautiful street art portraits in unauthorized locations. They are often enhanced through the use of graffiti markers. C215 also began using spray painting techniques in 2005. He believes that graffiti is focusing on a name by marking a territory and street art is placing art in the perfect location.   Each of his stencils has its own story, and most of them come from his very own pictures. His primary medium for art is stencil graffiti or street art. In fact, his collection of works is so massive, primarily because he cuts stencils and paints almost every day. In October 2014, C215 visited Valletta, Malta, because of his interest in Caravaggio as well as 17th-century religious architecture. He produced various examples of street art on post boxes within the city, but MaltaPost removed the artworks after a few days. Various people have criticized MaltaPost for removing the artworks, including the mayor of Valletta Alexei Dingli. In addition to his street work, C215 also produces commercial artwork for galleries on wood and canvas. C215 has to date done a number of solo gallery shows to promote his work. Shepard Fairey said about him: ""C215's art captures a light, depth, and humanity that is difficult, and rare, using stencils, his chosen medium. Stencils tend to flatten images and make them static, but C215 has developed a style of illustrating and stenciling that yields an impressionistic illumination of his subject's character. Even though his technique is meticulously refined, C215's work transcends the formal and seems to get to the core of compassion and belief in the human spirit. Encountering C215's pieces on the street always makes me happy.""   Although C215 has been writing and publishing poetry separately, the artist never adds text to his stencils, in order to give the viewer the full possibility of the interpretation. In his choosing of the backgrounds, layers of random, yet well selected found objects speak of the passing time, with an outcome that is both aesthetic and meaningful. His elaborate stencils - if outside a gallery - appear in the streets of various cities all over the globe, such as New Delhi, London, Istanbul, Fes, Rome, Barcelona, and Paris. Lighting up the urban spaces, they decorate; every stencil has a reason to exist in its specific, well-thought of place and all his pieces are hand cut and sprayed originals with a mix of found objects. He is represented by Vertical Gallery, Artstübli, iDroom, Azart Gallery, 999Contemporary, GCA Gallery, We Art Partners and Hang-Up Gallery London.  Featured image photo credits Claire Boucher.",1895
Dabs Myla,"Melbourne natives Dabs Myla are a dynamic duo who have been living and working in Los Angeles since 2009, and they absolutely love it. They say it feels like home. Warm colors of L.A. and its vibrant life had an impact on their style, so they welcomed the change. It was in 1995 that Dabs started painting graffiti, unlike Myla who has been painting with a brush most of her career. During art school, where they met while studying illustration, Dabs started using acrylic. Along with their love, a unique style was born, and that is when they both started using spray paint. As it turns out they liked their collaborative work better than the individual one. From that point on they have been working together. They only work solo when they paint letters.  Inspired by graffiti, food, travel and their life together as a couple, their paintings depict Dabs’ mischievous characters on Myla’s photorealistic cityscapes. They say, with smiles on their faces, how in all their years together, not a day has passed that they’ve been separate. As they would say, truly – two peas in a pod, that is if peas were this creative, ingenious and flamboyant. The duo does all their work together, at a shared desk. And this is what brings them closer. When something happens, a spill on the painting, or an error – it’s not a problem, they will fix it. They keep motivating each other, growing ideas, and never separating their work, in the means of who did what. It is one art piece, and they are clearly one love, so why separate. They keep pushing their creative boundaries, and the collaborative process is blooming with ideas.   Their works include installations, murals, and paintings. They are also featured on famous clothing bradns, such as Vans collection 2016. The most ambitious exhibition yet was Before and Further, when Dabs and Myla transformed a 4,000 square foot factory property. Space was filled with their newest paintings, installations, sculptures, and furnishing, including hand-painted ceramics and custom-made light installations. This was more than an exhibition, it was an experience. In 2015 the duo reinvented the logo for MTV Movie Awards, symbolically claiming their place in pop culture history. In all of their art, not only do we get to witness the immense talent they both poses, but also a one of a kind consciousness two people can create and is not seen very often.   When working outside, on exteriors, they use bold colors, and heavy strokes, while their paintings are subtle, gentle and harmonious. No matter what they do, their shared love for narrative illustrations is definitely to brighten everybody’s day. They imagine cityscapes inhabited by photorealistic drawings, with the most adorable faces. The impeccable drawings, filled with either paint or graffiti spray bring to life anything they set their minds to. Whether it’s a hydrant, flower or a piece of furniture, it will bring up the warmest memories from your childhood and make you feel like a child again, and all that with their weirdly, joyfully precise lines and fiery colors.

Faith47,"Located on the southernmost tip of the African continent, South Africa is widely known for its ethnic and cultural diversity and eleven official languages. But what many people don’t know is that the country has the contemporary art scene that is as diverse and vibrant as the population living there. One of the most talented creatives coming from this amazing country is Faith47, a street artist whose original name is still unknown but whose work is instantly recognizable. Inspired primarily by the social realities in her homeland, Faith47 creates striking graffiti and murals that deal with the universal themes of life, death, freedom, authority and respect. The artist also produces works on canvas, photographs and collages often with found objects which she cleverly incorporates into the artwork.  Born in 1979, Faith47 is a self-taught street artist and graphic designer active on the streets of Cape Town for more than fifteen years now. Through her creative practice, she conveys her thoughts on the political, social and environmental spheres and cultural traditions in her homeland. Her raw and realistic murals tackle issues like injustice and inequality making powerful political and social statements. Inspired primarily by the social realities in her country, she skillfully creates artworks  that evoke strong emotions and illustrate the profound political and social instability of South Africa.     In her early works, Faith47 was interested in juxtaposing the large difference between the promises of a better life and some harsh realities of life that most South Africans have to face constantly. Additionally, she became interested in the themes like the human condition and our relationship to animals and nature, for example, her monochromatic piece Estamos Todos Los Que Cabemos - painted in Haarlem in 2015 - speaks of the migratory patterns of birds, while The Taming of the Beasts – painted in Shanghai in 2012 – draws attention to the execution of rhinos from their natural habitat. One of her most recent series of works is entitled 7.83 Hz, after the natural phenomenon in which thousands of thunderstorms each second create an “atmospheric heartbeat known as Schumann resonance,” the highest frequency of which is 7.83 Hz. In her pieces, this resonance serves as a metaphor for our collective actions, which create an overall reverberation that we can call human nature.    Primarily known for her outdoor pieces, Faith47 creates nothing less than amazing studio works that she has exhibited in galleries throughout the world including her native country, Europe, Australia and the United States. The artist’s first personal show in her native county was held at David Krut Projects Parkwood from November 2012 to January 2013. Entitled Fragments of a Burnt History, the show was composed of an installation of found objects and pieces created in the artist’s studio. The exhibition was inspired by the Faith47's experience of living in the city of Johannesburg and all the problems that a common person faces in his/her daily life. The exhibition was followed by a highly successful Aqua Regalia - Chapter One at Moniker Projects, London in 2014, and Aqua Regalia – Chapter Two at Jonathan Levine Gallery, New York in 2015. Her work is included in Freedom as Form exhibition, alongside BR1, Alexis Diaz and Eron at Wunderkammern Milano. The show is open until August 10, 2016.  ",1897
Conor Harrington,"Conor Harrington combines street art with realist painting. This Irish born artist did graffiti in his early days and he still enjoys painting outdoor murals but keeps on track with completely new and inventive form, mostly in gallery settings. He uses an inside-outside way to present his work. Both on the streets and in the galleries. Conor’s early work inside this form involved cutting-edge graffiti techniques with an aim to create multi-layered artworks, akin to abstract expressionist artists’ works. This is the point where radical street art movement met an anti-figurative counterpart of the early and mid-20th century.   It wasn’t before the mid-90s that Conor included male figurative aspects. For example, in his work titled The Rum and Raisin of Irish Society, one young contemporary metropolitan man juxtaposes with the classic masculine identity. On the other hand, some male icons he used, like for example Formula One drivers, are meant to examine and explore that universal tendency towards machismo at the peak of the gender role crisis today. One characteristic of his inside as well as of his outside pieces is that he usually depicts images of people in a realistic manner while incorporating some abstract elements. By using a bold line in his work, together with exquisite shading and bursts of color, he creates a precision surface and texture in illustrations of the human form. A darker color palette Harrington chooses presents an alternation of obscured and revealed parts of the figure on the painting. A large scale of sharp lines next to the softer image of the human form is his way of modernizing what could be interpreted as a more classical image. He clearly has a message for the audience (or better said, he opens a resonant dialogue with the viewer) and by tackling socio-political themes - he stands tall among this new breed of young people that use fine art techniques in a context formerly reserved for street artists.   In 2008, Harrington’s exhibition Weekend Warriors opened a new era for him – for the first time he showed costumes and other historical descriptors such as Europe's uniforms of the 16th century. These historic clues were meant to examine current affairs and conditions in the world.  A piece from this series titled Saint with the Powers of Superman illuminated a modern man's fascination with his own personal fights he might be battling inside – in the context of these day’s war that are waged simply by a remote control. For 2012's Dead Meat exhibition, that took place at Lazarides Rathbone, Conor was inspired by the Regency-era costumes on, once again, contemporary models. He even included the pin-up models for the female nudes, telling the story of one pretty hedonistic banquet.  However, this lavish feast symbolizes the end of global Anglo-Saxon influence in the present day. Some metaphorical visual cues are also a part of this series, following the example of a Renaissance-era old master painting.   A Whole Lot of trouble for a Little Bit of Win show was held in 2013 at the same gallery as Dead Meat. This exhibition actually profiled his notable study paintings. Next year, in 2014, Eat and Delete show introduced Instagram as a part of the vision – Conor has been updating his Instagram with photographs of a progress and the entire process of preparing this show.  Eat and Delete was planned to come to life at a previously undisclosed pop-up location in Manhattan, being so his first solo exhibition in New York. All in all, the show surprised the viewers by introducing a different kind of visual experience – during the whole exhibition, a series of short films were on display. Most of the video material was made in collaboration with film and music maker Andrew Telling and included some of his previous documentary works, as well as the original recreation of the dramatic narrative throughout the film.   During 2015, Harrington’s oil and spray paint piece on stretched linen titled Dance with the Devil was sold for amazing $116,413 at Bonham’s Auction. Even though this painting had an estimated pre-sale price between $45,000 and $75,000 - it was sold for more than, for example, Rude Copper on the same auction, a piece by Banksy himself, sold for $48,800. The additional curiosity was the fact that this was the first time that he ever had his work up for auction. Conor’s works can be found all across the globe, from the United States and the United Kingdom to Norway, Spain, and the Bethlehem Wall.  He is represented by Hang-Up Gallery and Lazarides.  ",1898
Terry Rodgers,"Considered as one of the world’s most famous representatives of representational painting, Terry Rodgers made a name for himself by depicting what seems to be perfect. At first, the viewers are confused, as the paintings look like they are a part of some advertising campaign. They become trapped in this world and slowly begin to define themselves through media images they are exposed to on a daily basis. Strongly interested in film and photography, these two fields nudged the artist’s style in the direction of representational realism.  Born in Newark, NJ, Terry Rodgers grew up in Washington, D.C. He studied Fine Art at the Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he graduated cum laude in 1969. Inspired by the American writers David Foster Wallace and Thomas Pynchon, musicians Bob Dylan, Jimmy Hendricks and The Rolling Stones, and influenced by David Salle, Max Beckman, Diego Velászquez, Otto Dix, but also Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, Rodgers chose the oil paint as his favorite medium. It was a logical choice since it possesses greater viscosity and definition than everything but the film, but then, a film requires significant funding and a crew. Considering creativity to be the same as invention, he focuses on perception, making his surrounding the subjects of his paintings.[1] The seductive power of his work is unquestionable, as both man and women are depicted glamorous, their hair being perfect, full lips, and teeth that are sparkling white. As if he’s trying to capture all those confusions to which we are all subjected, confronting the desires we all have with the realistic possibilities that are not that perfect.   However, as perfect as this world may seem, Terry Rodgers is fully aware there is no such thing as perfection. With no intention of criticizing anything, he paints what he sees – fragile humans trying to connect with the others. The parties, one of his favorite subjects, often depicted, show just how much it can all be superficial. Every single painting takes a considerable amount of time, and Rodgers manages to finish about 12 to 13 paintings per year. For each of those, he photographs dozens of people in his studio. Sometimes models, sometimes ordinary people, and sometimes celebrities – he finds them everywhere. At restaurants, clubs, streets, airports. One thing is common for them all. Something in their appearance, a detail in their faces, their posture, intrigues the artist, and he invites them to his studio. Rodgers then draws them, slowly drafting the final picture in his imagination. His assistant paints a first, rather a rough color version of the piece in acrylic, before the artist himself begin applying layer upon layer of translucent oil in a process that can last for months. One of the most important parts of the whole process is the thought of the viewers. Since he thinks of them as a part of the concept, Rodgers paints pieces with peculiar, attention-attracting details, or the dimensions of a small cinema screen. These immediately pull the viewers into the semi-imaginary world and make them members in the chain of connections between the figures in the painting. His solo show entitled Solo Spaces at Torch Gallery in Amsterdam was on display from October 29, 2016 until December 31, 2016. It marked a self-reflective turn in the artist's oeuvre. Rodgers' new work expands on the feelings of detachment and desire explored in his earlier work while emphasizing a contemporary disconnect between body and mind.   His first big and audacious show, in 2004 in Amsterdam, was called Angels of Desire. He then presented ten works of dramatic boldness and electrifying insight into the American and the entire Western culture simultaneously galvanized by terror and sated by technologically-driven ease. In 2009, the Scheringa Museum of Realist Art in Spanbroek organized the first European museum exhibition solely devoted to Terry Rodgers, titled Boundaries of Desire. With twenty large paintings and a number of sketches, the museum presented an overview of Rodgers’ unique oeuvre as it has developed over the last decades. The initial allure of his luxurious fictional world serves only to veil the artist's true subject: the tension between desire and loneliness. The viewer sees a beauty that is as inviting as it is repugnant, in which the figures exude boredom, loneliness and a yearning for human contact.[2] His works is included in prestigious collections such as the Stedelijk Museum-Hertogenbosch, the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung in Munich, the Museum Franz Gertsch in Burgdorf, the Museum Folkwang in Essen, the Scheringa Museum of Realist Art in Spanbroek, the Kunsthal Rotterdam, the Kunsthalle Krems in Austria, Kunsthalle Emden in Germany, Kunstmuseum Bern and Zentrum Paul Klee, me Berlin, the Helnwein Museum Galerie Rudolfinum in Prague, and the Kunsthalle Rotterdam.

Cope2,"Cope2, born as Fernando Carlo in 1968, is one of the pioneers of New York graffiti art. Great, ingenious, controversial, admired, arrested, loved and respected, this legendary artist has been active in the street game since 1985. The first graffiti he ever wrote was on a train done in his wild style manner. The international credit came in the 90's after he went through a troublesome time of working with gangs, living on the streets, and fighting to evolve as an artist. To pursue a career in street art was not his initial desire, however, the spontaneous jaunts to lettering and tagging brought him to where he is now - a legend of the Bronx style and a true mainstream graffiti star.  His personal best are the throw-up style wobbly letters, made out of two different styles, the wild style, and some hard lines. They are readable, recognizable and appreciated both in large formats on the walls, and in smaller scale inside many galleries worldwide. He started writing in the late 70's, early 80's when New York only started being the center of street art. Inspired and influenced by this cousin Chico80, Cope2 was painting at night, riding the subway and watching all the names of Big Apple's legends pass him by. Born in Southern Brox, he had everything but the easy childhood. Coming from diverse ancestry, American and Puerto Rican, Cope 2 emerged in both cultures, never giving up on his roots, but adapting himself to the rough style of hip-hop and street life. His first tool was a marker, and the first canvas was the wall on the stair of the building he grew up at. Joining the forces with his cousin Chico80 and Nano, he tagged his first subway train cart, actually the four of them.    The excitement and feeling of accomplishment followed by adrenaline set the path for him, and he could never go back. He didn't want to either because just some years after the first tagging he formed his own crew, the famous KD, Kids Destroy, that later changed to Kings Destroy. The King line originated from his graffiti ancestors, where the popular line was to tag King on every line, the King being a hard earned a title for every expedition one went on. Naturally, Cope2 started ruling his own kingdom and spreading the borders across the Bronx all the way to New York. As the 80's were coming to an end, a lot of graffiti artist were dropping out of the scene and leaving spray paint for good. There were many gangs in New York, problems with drugs and police force so many artists chose to cooperate with drug lords, dealing on the streets just to earn basic income. After the series of undercover operations, many artists were arrested or settling as double agents. Cope2 had a way of coping, but many others left the scene. Adventurous spirit drove him all over New York, not the just Bronx, as he enjoyed tagging. He teamed up with Per FX, Jez, Cap and painted not just trains, but walls also. At the end of the 80's decade a traumatic experience got him to try to change his lifestyle, as he nearly faced death in street shooting, drug related of course, and after two weeks being indoors he decided it was time to stop living dangerously, but not adventurously.   If we had to summarize Fernando Carlo in one word, or better two, we would say Cope2 is as wild as his throw-ups. The famous mix of styles, semi wild-style, and throw-up got him major wall space and in 1993 he joined Per FX in excursions all over the city. The younger artist started looking up to him, older writers respected him, police hunted him, while he was tagging where he wanted. An interesting fact is that he did not change his style for over 40 years. The throw up is usually something between the tag and a bomb, where the outline is filled with one layer of color. This method was very popular in the 80's since the police were always onto the graffiti artist, and they did not have the luxury of time to complete their works in detail, so a quick delivery was a perfect solution. Throw-ups were also very popular among street competitions, where one could easily paint dozen of them in a jiffy. Cope2 liked his throw-up, because, besides the tag, it was part of his identity, legacy and served as a token of recognition, self-promotion, and self-respect.    The 90's were a golden period for Fernando Carlo, who started getting his first commissioned contracts and opportunity to collaborate with famous brands. He did work for both Adidas and Nike had international exhibitions and continued to inspire others. However not everything was coming up roses, there was a huge battle going out among the group of artists who worked with him. It happened few times that Cope2 was painting a wall, and a few days later a word Snitch would be written over his name. This was a recurring occurrence and him defend his honor every single time. He claims that someone wanted to become famous posting these photos, by referring to two people in a case of vandalism. The main battlefield is the internet. Like in the past, where many fought for the kingdom governance of the street line, nowadays the battle has been moved online, and the territory is virtual, but the lines, the words matter. Cope2 does not hesitate to fight his battles on social media, but he strives to do it in a positive manner, spreading love instead hate, and keeping away from feeding the trolls. However, his sharp language hurt many and a lot of his contemporaries excluded him from the clique because of the online remarks.   Not all time online was repetitive relying on hateful comments, his willingness to work hard for himself got him to collaboration with many galleries, commissioned work, to moving his work from the streets to small formats. His paintings were selling and still are selling, and the online haters are not important anymore. Cope2 has a positive philosophy of life but approaches it realistically. He realized on time he had to change since the world had changed, and when he became a grandfather at the age forty, he switched his priorities, from fighting for principles to fighting for legacy. He finds inspiration in all of the works of Dondi, in successful artists like Kaws, Shepard Fairey, and Jose Parla. When he maintains his blog, he tries to promote himself, to write about his success, works, and to stay out of trouble. It doesn't matter that he is already a legend in the graffiti world, for him, the learning process never stops. He likes to experiment with tools and techniques, and in newer street and gallery works Cope2 combined layers and drips, painted abstractions, even used old photographs in order to expand his design and make it more personal and authentic.     The paintings he makes are honest, visually complex, and inspired by different energy. Having two open cases against him, he has to stay out of painting graffiti, at least the illegal ones. So, the gallery contracts were the perfect opportunity for Cope2 to continue to make art, but stay safe and sound. He is a family man, who has to take care of others, who cannot fight the neverending battle of gang vendetta. Revealing information on his friends and other artists was never an option, not even when he snitch rewriting took a toll on his reputation. His job is to stay true to his beliefs, so painting canvases still come straight from the heart, as well as the brand collaborations, but they come out of fun too. That little evolution for him was a necessary escape since the city changed so much. Cope2 is one of the old school legend, a member of the generation of a graffiti artist who risked everything for a tag and line. Before it was all about hierarchy and respect, it was about reputation and integrity. It was a time where no one could his behind the computer screen under the anonymous or alias name. So, no one is bombing, throwing and experimenting, it is done differently nowadays, but the streets remember the days when Cope2 was the king of the line. Cope2 is represented by Galerie Mathgoth in Paris, Vertical Gallery in Chicago, 19Karen Contemporary Artspace in Mermaid Beach, Australia, Azart Gallery, New York and Galerie Onega in Paris. ",1900
Beejoir,"The artist Beejoir is best known for his dry-humored and politically focused street art. He works in a broad variety of media experimenting with painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography and stencil. Beejoir was born in the UK but now spends much of his time living and practicing in Bangkok, Thailand. He exhibits in both the UK and abroad and has an international following. Beejoir’s trademark slurs and rants have appeared on walls all over the world, and his unique style of formulating two very different images together has created some beautiful and powerful images over the past few years. Among his best-known images are his LV Child, Turin Scam and his dripping spot paintings. His trademark slurs and political rants have appeared on walls from Bangkok to Shoreditch. Painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography and stencils are his mediums. Contrasting visual elements and saturated colors make his work personal and accessible eye catching. One step beyond and the familiar, comfortable frame disappears leaving yourself mumbling and scratching your head, immersed in considerations regarding the ultra-violent nature of the shiny happy people, the unsustainable way of living we are buried in and a huge feeling of guilt.",1901
AJ Fosik,"AJ Fosik is an American artist, known for his carefully crafted and vividly colored wooden sculptures. Fosik’s feral creations take the shape of fantastic beings that communicate a subversive, anti-religious commentary through the depiction of hyperbolized fictional gods. The artist's works are influenced by the concept of totems and fetishes. His nameless and meaningless pieces are created in order to examine the nature of spiritual iconography and the nature of existence. He is vocal in expressing his dissatisfaction with the way in which new urban art is moving, as it is becoming more and more a part of the mainstream culture. By using wood and found materials, he creates figurative, eclectic and intricately designed three-dimensional works that intrigue and provoke.  AJ Fosik was born in Detroit, Michigan, where he also grew up. No one in his family was an artist, nor had any interest in making objects. He wasn't raised religious, however, he went to catholic school for a while, before he was expelled for fighting. Later on, the artist attended Parsons School of Design in New York City. Fosik obtained his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration in 2003. He is a self-taught woodworker. After that, he moved across the United States several times, as he liked the idea of nomadic lifestyle and traveling as much as possible. Enjoying the freedom of nomadic exploration, he lived in various cities, such as Denver, New York, San Diego and Philadelphia. As much as he likes traveling abroad, Fosik claims that he would never move out of the United States. Prior to creating his three-dimensional works and installations, Fosik was interested in urban art. While most graffiti writers work by night in order to avoid being caught, AJ Fosik preferred working in the early morning, because nobody was awake on Saturday around 6 AM.    The artist's work ethic is strong, almost compulsive, his skill finely honed, and his art truly unique and immediately recognizable. The sculptor, who doesn't believe in having any free time, started making his three-dimensional artworks, which he hesitates to call sculptures, in 2004. At some point, AJ Fosik shifted from 2D to 3D works, which are essentially similar to his 2D pieces, as they are constructed in the same way. This rebellious workaholic enjoys investigating the boundary between 2D and 3D. Fosik tries to stay away from the computer as much as possible and do all his work by hand. For him, the computer is not a medium, but just a tool. The artist, who is passionate about his artistic improvement, has admitted that he cannot stand his old works. Once, while clearing the gallery, he threw away all of his old artworks.   Fosik's idols are nameless, assigned no specific meanings or powers, beholden to no formal faith — real or contrived. They are not meant to contribute to some grand theological narrative of the artist’s design. His artwork explores the powerful medium of language and metaphor. Fosik’s animal subjects and anthropomorphized creatures are built using a complex process in which each form is carefully handcrafted by arranging hundreds of pieces of individually cut and varnished wood, which the sculptor paints in vibrant colors and patterns. Sharp teeth, claws, and eyes emerge once the creatures are completed – some are constructed as freestanding forms while others are wall-mounted, referencing modern taxidermy practices. The presence of his fantasy creatures is intimidating. Evocative of American Folk Art and inspired by subversive cultural influences that shift complacency, Fosik’s work suspends comfort with the appeal of familiar symbols and images. In this dynamic tension, the art and viewer come together in an expanded definition of culture and assumption. AJ Fosik looks up to anyone who embraces their existence, despite its meaninglessness.   Against the Infinite was AJ Fosik's 2013 exhibition at Jonathan Levine Gallery in New York, and his third solo show at the gallery. The exhibition presented fantasy creatures at odds with themselves, worried about their mortality. The body of work was influenced by the book The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for his work on psychology and philosophy. The 3D beasts, hanging on the walls of the gallery or displayed as free-standing sculptures, were battling their own internal conflicts and their dualistic nature, torn between their physical self and a symbolic self. The exhibition also featured a large installation, consisting of 30 individual heads on panels, which formed a stunning geometric shape with 30 sides. The notions of mortality and invention were presented through skulls, sickles, swords and exposed rib cage.   AJ's work has been featured in numerous popular publications, including The Drama, Tokion, Juxtapoz, FecalFace.com, NY Arts, Illustration Play, SF Guardian, Ruby, The Brooklyn Rail, Hi-Fructose, Walls & Frames, Picto Plasma, Lost at E Minor, Picnic from Mexico, Belifo from Spain, Bang Art from Italy and many more. In 2011, the American heavy metal band Mastodon commissioned his artwork for the cover of their fifth studio album, The Hunter. Also, the band’s music video Black Tongue showed AJ Fosik creating the sculpture in his studio.   The recognitions from all over the world have allowed AJ Fosik to exhibit his works in numerous galleries throughout the United States, in the cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Austin, Miami, San Francisco, and abroad in Paris and Mexico City. His artworks were also displayed at places like Jonathan Levine Gallery and Giant Robot Gallery in New York, Vice Gallery in Mexico City, Guerrero Gallery in San Francisco, Galerie L.J. in Paris, and David B. Smith Gallery in Denver. The sculptor is represented by the Library Street Collective in Detroit, and the Jonathan Levine Gallery in New York, United States.  ",1902
Alexone Dizac,"Alexone Dizac is a French artist, painter and illustrator, coming from the Graffiti world. He is best known for mixing paint drips, ghost tags drawn with a marker pen or a spray can, flames, one-line geometrical patterns, funny punchlines and of course his surrealistic bestiary such as beheaded or blind penguins, cats, strange looking elephants... Dizac Alexander was born in Paris. At the end of the 80’s, Alëxone discovered Graffiti Art, and at the time, he became interested in art. At the beginning of the Nineties, he sprays graffiti on subway trains and in waste grounds, which lasts two or three years. By the year 1995, he develops his calligraphic work under the name “Oedipe” which can be described as stretched calligraphies with curves and thick angles, some really minimalistics and others very dense, all painted on disused surroundings and buildings. In the year 2000, he starts to introduce characters in his work and becomes Alëxone. It is at the sides of Jean Faucheur that he is initiated with the techniques of billboard posting. Thus, he creates works on paper intended for a precise place, which he will then stick in the streets. He does not hesitate to use various mediums and supports: aerosol, paper, acrylic paint and resin… He integrates the collective “9éme Concept” and takes part in the itinerant exhibition “Sang Neuf ” based on diversion of the medical care sheet of the French social security. In 2005, Alëxone carries out his first personal exhibition, at Alice Gallery, based in Brussels. In June 2006 opens his first show at the Speerstra Gallery in Paris, entitled “C’est quoi ton blaze? Je tague ass!” He is also a member of the Belgian crew, the GM (Gentle Men), with whom he artistically continues to explore urban territories. In June 2007, he participates at an in situ wall-painting for the show “L’Art Modeste sous les Bombes” at the Auberives’ abbey. Very colored, Alëxone creates a surrealist universe, with animals and characters, sometimes ridiculous, turning in derision today’s society. His work is meticulous, and requires a long preparation. Playing with curves and introducing calligraphy in his colored landscapes. Even if Alëxone seems to move away from street art, he does not forget where he came from, we can thus find elements of them in his work, like his trees of which the roots finish in arrows.",1903
Brett Amory,"Brett Amory is an American artist, best known for his ongoing Waiting series of paintings in which he poetically depicts isolation caused by the big city life. Born in 1975 in Chesapeake, Virginia, he has lived in San Francisco for 15 years before relocating to Oakland in 2009, where he is currently based. In the past year, he has had solo shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, New York and San Jose. Amory began the Waiting series in 2001 with paintings depicting commuter subjects seemingly detached from their fellow passengers and surrounding environments, inspired by the introverted culture of public transit and inhabitants of the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco (where the artist lived for fifteen years). Figures and places in Amory’s work are based on photographs the artist has taken of ordinary city architecture and random people who he sees on a daily basis but never speaks to. Brett feels especially drawn to individuals who look lost, lonely or awkward - those who don’t appear to fit in socially. As the title suggests, the Waiting series is about how we rarely experience living in the now, always awaiting what will come next or obsessed with what has already transpired. In our age of distraction, being in the present is difficult to achieve outside of meditation practice, it requires heightened cognitive awareness and clear mental space, often prevented by constant internal dialogue, preoccupation with memories of the past and/or concern for the future. Amory’s work attempts to visually represent this concept of disconnection and anticipation, conveying the idea of transient temporality that exists in most moments of our daily lives. ",1904
Bezt,"The peculiar take on representation in graffiti art in the work of Bezt has made him perhaps one of the most interesting figures within the Polish scene. The fine drawing, distinct coloring, and overall approach to the surface reflect the artist’s high painterly domains. Regardless of the media, Bezt invests tremendous efforts in creating strong narratives which should deliver the certain message. Fantastical, perhaps mythical or even dreamy, his works can certainly be perceived as images from another world. Nevertheless, Bezt’s solo works are inseparable from his activity within a duo called Etam Cru, which he formed with the artist Sainer.   Bezt was born in 1987 in Turek, Poland. He finished the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódź, where he met Sanier and the two started painting together. Besides the collaboration, Bezt soon became a successful commercial artists and freelance designers. Bezt is particularly specialized in frescoes and has released a large number of public works usually on facades of dim and gray buildings from socialist era. At the current moment, Bezt splits his time between traveling around Europe together with Sanier to paint murals at a variety of street art festivals and producing his individual work and exhibiting solo shows.    The artist handles several media at once, but primarily he's an illustrator, muralist, and painter. The employment of floral motifs, animals and woman portraits is interwoven with metaphors and symbols often borrowed from local folklore. Although his works strive for realism, they are still maintained in a characteristic style sourced from graffiti. At the same time, the artist very often juxtaposes representational and deconstructive geometric elements. The contrasting colors separate the figures from the background perfectly enabling the observer to see the composition beautifully.    In 2015 Bezt has been invited to participate in MyFinBec project, dedicated to urban art,  organized by Swiss winery FinBec. They have commissioned artists to create artworks to be used on labels of their fine organic wine, so Bezt provided the highly imaginative solution. Together with Natalia Rak, Bezt was commissioned the mural Knocking on Heavens door for the inaugurating of the brand new RAD Napa project. Polish art duo battled the horrid weather, creating a striking image consisting of landscape, figurative work, and with the use of vibrant, over saturated colors for full effect.   Being the part of  Etam Cru, Bezt was able to develop and perfect further his own inspiration. His works can be found on various buildings and with those ephemeral images, the artist surely goes beyond the borders of the graffiti as an artistic expression. As the times passed by, Bezt’s activity increased and he participated in a number of exhibitions and festivals. That goes along with the Etam Cru since they have created works all over the world, including their murals in the USA. Whether working by himself or in duo, the work of Bezt definitely reflects the artist’s outstanding efforts not only to beautify the chosen site but to employ the context and the atmosphere in order to achieve the best possible result.

Oscar Murillo,"Life can be unpredictable, but amazing. One day you’re a cleaner, mopping the floors to get yourself through art school, and on the next, your painting is sold for more than $400 000. Oscar Murillo is a versatile Colombian-British contemporary artist, who works in painting, installations, fine art, abstractions, and performance art. Thanks to his fast rise in the world of art, he is often called the 21st-century Basquiat. It’s a notable title and it carries specific weight, but Murillo proves on daily bases that he’s worth of being compared to one of the most famous artists ever.  Murillo was born in La Paila, Colombia – a small town where his family worked in sugar-cane mills. Pursuing a better life, his entire clan immigrated to London, when Oscar was 10 years old. In the UK, he cleaned offices to put himself through art school. Murillo earned his BFA in 2007 from the University of Westminster in London and completed his MFA in 2012 at the Royal College of Art. After graduating, he worked as a teacher in a secondary school, but soon he quit his job and traveled to South America. After that, he dedicated himself to art entirely. Diverse and original from the beginning, Murillo’s art practice includes performance, installation, publishing, painting and sculpture – where he uses a variety of different media and techniques, including text, recycled materials, and fragments collected from his studio. His defiantly un-precious paintings are usually made by using a broomstick – he even stitches together multiple canvases, listing “dirt” among used materials and tagging the work with large enigmatic words (YOGA, CHORIZO, MILK).   The buzz surrounding Murillo began in 2011 with his performance art piece Animals die from eating too much – – yoga! – when he had several women twisted into yoga poses as the audience watched. Oscar Murillo’s meteoric rise in the United States came next year, in 2012. Donald and Mera Rubell, one of the world’s largest, privately owned contemporary art collectors, have bought pieces made by artists like Richard Prince, Maurizio Cattelan, Mike Kelley, Keith Haring and Basquiat early in their careers. After seeing a suite of paintings Murillo created for the London dealer Stuart Shave, shown at the Independent Art Fair in New York, they came and met Murillo in a studio at Hunter College, where he had a residency. Ms. Rubell recalled that first meeting: “We arrived at 9 a.m., and he looked disheveled, exhausted, like a homeless person. He’d stayed up 36 hours straight and had made seven or eight paintings, so he had something to show us. They blew us away. We ended up spending four hours talking to him.” The Rubells bought all the work and invited Murillo to their Contemporary Arts Foundation in Miami where he stayed for six weeks and created a series of large-scale canvases (one was a seven-meter-long painting which he made in the private museum of Don and Mera Rubell). The star was born! In 2013, in just four months, his auction price raised from $37,500 (at his auction debut at Sotheby’s) to $400,000 (at Phillips)!   That same year, the South London Gallery held the Murillo’s first major solo exhibition in the UK. He presented stitched canvases, drawings, sculptures and films, tables constructed from copper sheets, used as flooring in previous shows, and floor pieces made from masses of pulped biro drawings… For this show, Murillo incorporated an active component in the form of a lottery – the individually screen-printed, artist-signed tickets. This artist’s large-scale paintings at first glance appear chaotic, but in fact, they are meticulously comprised of roughly made, stitched canvases. “I like to cut up the canvas in different sections, work on them individually, fold them and just leave them around for months. I don’t work on a painting with the goal of finishing it or having a complete and finished painting at the end of a work process.”  Murillo’s paintings, video art, installations, and performances evoke such themes as community, very much influenced and inspired by his cross-cultural ties to London and his native Colombia. He also works a lot with video and participatory installation. Murillo’s work titled “family parties” is composed of vibrant films, saturated with motion and color, of intimate gatherings of his friends and kin. These pieces are illustrations of localized ceremony and everyday happenings – the celebration and ritual of a collective public. ""I’ve been very cautious as to how I appropriate these family parties and bring them into the realm of my art practice and out to the public as an event that happens within the art world.""  In 2013, Murillo created Frequencies, an international art project in collaboration between students aged primarily 10 to 16 from schools across the globe. Over the course of 3 years, Frequencies are to travel across the globe to record the creative expression of children on the cusp of growing into young adults. Itinerant Works is managing the production of the entire project in collaboration with Oscar Murillo and David Zwirner Gallery. The idea of this project is that Murillo visits different schools in the world; inspiring children to document their creativity on canvases are temporarily affixed to classroom desks. The project aims to offer cross-cultural and social insights into youth communities around the world.   In 2014, at Christie’s, the bidding opened on a Murillo’s abstract painting filled with black scratching, titled Burrito. In the first minutes, the auctioneer announced that there were already 17 telephone and absentee buyers vying for the canvas, made in 2011. It was sold for $322,870, six times more than estimated.  In the same year, Murillo created quite a commotion in Madrid – a protest banner included in his installation was removed from the artwork by a museum guard. Murillo’s solo show was to inaugurate the newly-built cultural center Centro Cultural Daoiz y Velarde in Madrid. Centro Cultural’s construction took 7 years and €13 million to complete. Due to the government-imposed austerity measures and spending cuts, a group of protesters spontaneously formed outside on the day of the opening, carrying signs with slogans such as “€13 million, 7 years—cultural center or electoral propaganda?” Murillo was deeply surprised and moved by the protesters and their cause, having in mind that he had no prior knowledge of the controversy surrounding the building. When he was informed, Murillo decided to take an action, so he grabbed the banner and hung it in an installation titled De marcha, ¿una rumba? No, sólo un desfile con ética y estética standing in the middle of the exhibition. “This is a work in motion. What I do depends on the things happening around me.” But the banner had been removed and when Murillo asked the guards to put it back on claiming that it was the part of his exhibition, the manager refused at first. However, after Murillo’s protest, the banner was re-hung.   The show included pieces from 17 artists who, in their refusal to allow the viewers to define or even meter time by artworks, reflect a singular approach that characterizes our cultural moment at the beginning of a new millennium. William Gibson, a science fiction writer, identified this phenomenon and used the term “a-temporality” to describe a cultural product of our moment that paradoxically doesn’t represent, through style, through content, or through a medium, the time from which it comes. The exhibition brought a fresh breeze into the art world and included several of Murillo’s canvases hung on the wall and eight more lying outstretched on the floor, where visitors are welcome to handle them – walking on them, wrapping themselves up in the canvases while cameras snapped away as they posed. The idea behind this experiment was to criticize art market, even though (or, maybe on purpose) the critics go straight to his artwork’s high prices. But, the stir doesn't end there. One of the canvases, titled Grid, was stolen from the exhibition. Murillo’s canvas displayed on the floor in the exhibition had disappeared. Letting visitors handle the canvases apparently left them vulnerable to, say, theft by a visitor with a backpack while a guard was distracted. Art collectors have come to understand that Murillo is a new Basquiat, however reductive or maybe pretentious that might seem. Just like Basquiat, Murillo is black, ambitious, and engaged with both art history and graffiti. And, what is most important: Oscar Murillo, like Basquiat, makes work that speaks to class issues.   Nothing short of brave – Murillo decided, in mid-flight to Sydney, to flush his passport down a toilet. What was behind it, an artistic instinct or motivation for a protest? Quite possibly the both. As he explained in his statement to The New York Times, there was originally no intention to start a protest, but it has undeniably become one. Destroying his passport was the perfect opportunity to challenge the conditions which allow him to travel the world, as a citizen. A disruptive situation created by the art undoubtedly has the reasonable potential to engage and address different structures of power in the contemporary society. He speaks of his own status as an artist, the state as an arbiter, and of course, the question of mobility in general. After being detained for two days, despite having a valid Colombian passport, Murillo was deported from Australia.   Young age often means a lack of experience. In the world of art, tidal waves of inspiration and tireless work can compensate that inexperience. It shows dedication and hunger for continuous progress – markings of a true artistic star. Now it’s up to Murillo to show everyone just how bright he can shine, how many people can his art reach and how many of them will be influenced and emotionally moved. So far, he’s on a right track to greatness. He is represented by David Zwirner and Carlos/Ishikawa.  ",1906
Wes Lang,"Gathering and rearranging American iconography and imagery of flags, cowboys, eagles and skulls, Wes Lang creates amusing artworks that refer to his role models such as Philip Guston, Martin Kippenberger, and Cy Twombly. Surrounded by things of his own making, the artist holds on the line from the film The Departed when Jack Nicholson says, “I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.” So, he wears T-shirts that he drew, drinks from the mugs he made and even has the socks he designed and customized Rolex watch on his hand. Creating some kind of visual and literal record of life, his paintings reveal everything, from his past to the future.  Lang was born in 1972 in Chatham New Jersey where he was growing up obsessed with Snoopy and Star Wars figures. Always having the support of the family, his first bigger artistic expression occurred at the age of six when his mother has allowed him to paint the walls of an entire room with Star Wars characters. Artistically inclined, his mother was an interior designer and his father a jazz critic who has owned a record store, where young Wes Lang worked occasionally. Not much worried by the bad grades at school, Lang knew that he wants to make art and nothing else[1]. His often controversial artworks range from collages and illustrations to paintings, processing the themes of Native Americans, eagles, buffalos and skulls conjoined with clippings from porn magazines and newspapers. They are directly influenced by his first job at a tattoo shop right after the high school, but his later employment at the Guggenheim Museum where he helped install exhibitions encouraged him to begin creating his own artwork. Carefully studying the works of Cy Twombly, Francis Bacon, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Martin Kippenberger, the artist likes to point out also Damien Hirst as his biggest inspiration whom he dedicated his 18-carat solid gold skull. After seeing a Francis Bacon exhibition at Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York, which was also the home for Basquiat and Keith Haring, he was offered a job there and a chance to show his own work. Still, at his 30th birthday, Lang decided to leave Shafrazi to become a full-time artist. Unlike other artists, he has never hidden the influences of his idols, openly borrowing the elements of Philip Guston’s or Franz Kline’s paintings: “I do that all the time. Unapologetically so. He's dead. There's no more of them. Those experiences in his life and all that stuff was his. But his influences are also mine, from my own experience of life, before I knew who he was.”[2] Sensing that he has fallen into New York’s monotony, he decided to move to the West Coast, living in the famous Hollywood Chateau Marmont Hotel where he drew on the hotel’s stationery paper inspired by its history which resulted in one-night exhibition Sittin’ on a Rainbow in 2011 when he showed his characteristic vibrantly colored landscape sketches and portraits of the hotel’s past guests. His fascination with the skulls found its expression at the exhibition Skulls and Shit (2006) in Loyal Gallery in Sweden when Lang teamed up with fellow artist Donald Baechler in a common idea of enjoying life while one is still alive. Two artists later released an art book of the same name exploring meditations of the human skulls.   Occasionally taking on commercial projects, such as box set of concert recordings for Grateful Dead, or designs for Rolex, it showed as a prosperous job, considering the fact that Kanye West chose Lang to design the merchandise for his Yeesuz Tour. This collaboration led to the rapper and some of his friends becoming collectors of Lang’s work. “It was a real honor when Kanye called. It kind of blew my mind,” he says. “But I don’t talk about it because it is not important. What is important is the fact that I helped him convey his message to the world. Everything should always be about combining people’s creative energies and putting something positive out into the world.” Remembering the Grateful Dead concert in 1990, when math teacher took him and a couple friends to the show, as the night that changed his life, it was a great honor to design something for the band. In his manner, the box covers feature a skull in a vividly colored Native American headdress, while each CD features renderings of butterflies, birds, and skeletons. His oeuvre also includes already popular line of clothing named Best Wishes. Carefully choosing his commercial projects, Lang has never been involved in something that could call into question his artistic integrity or compromised his work in a negative context. Still, his engagements for celebrities and famous brands cannot exceed his artistic qualities proved, as example, by his first major museum exhibition The Studio held at the Aros Aarhus Museum in Denmark in 2014 where he showed sixty various pieces from different periods of his career along with the remake of his own studio in the middle of the room space. For his previous solo show held in 2011 at V1 Gallery in Copenhagen, Lang exhibited the various body of work that included references from Bob Dylan to Cy Twombly to the Grateful Dead and Chet Baker. Processing the theme of survival, he displayed some kind of suggestion how to live life, dealing with the good and bad experiences. Although not interested in politics at all, the artist admits that he doesn’t read newspapers and never watch informative shows, his work has been the subject of controversies, like at the group exhibition Mail Order Monsters at Deitch Projects in New York in 2007 when Jeffrey Deitch had to remove Lang’s paintings a day after the opening because of the claims that were offensive to the black community[3]. Indivisibility of his creative expression and music influences is visible in the four large-scale paintings made as an homage to the famous John Coltrane, named after his 1964 album The Believer, shown at the exhibition at Eighteen Gallery in Copenhagen. His visual representations are paired with the tracks Ascension, Manifestation, Voyage, and My Favorite Things, followed by Egyptian symbols[4].   Using the icons from the visual universe of the American biker culture where the Playboy’s pin-up girls, curved motorbikes, and Indians represent the main association to the continent and its history, Wes Lang creates his life story through the borrowed words of his favorite songs. Blending his own personality and manner of life with the fictional and propagated way of American dream he transfers these pictures on artworks, but also on different useful items. Lang’s work has been exhibited in numerous solo and group shows in the United States and Europe. Focusing on his art and finding peace of mind, he is still passionate about his creative expression, pushing it every day one step further hoping for the great future.  Sources:   ",1907
Know Hope,"I hope to move heavy hearts at least one inch to the side by confessing that I'm petrified of and secretly in love with the world. This is a statement that serves as a fuel for the creative machine of Know Hope, a famous Israelian artist renowned for his narrative urban pieces, murals, assemblages and installations. His artworks have a distinct way of pulling the heart strings of the viewers as Addam Yekutieli tries to make emotions the focal point of every single piece he authors. It should be noted that Yekutieli is prone to presenting his pieces both on a street and within the gallery space - a decision he made in the year of 2004. Over the course of his career, Addam has developed a visual iconography and vocabulary he utilizes to reflect real-life situations and document the notions of a collective human struggle we face every day.  This artist was born in Los Angeles in 1986 and grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel. Over the past ten years, Addam Yekutieli has formed a unique visual iconography and vocabulary utilized to reflect real-life circumstances and observations, as well as document the notion of a joint struggle of the human kind. An instant give away that you are looking at one of his original pieces is identifying the characteristic puppet style that made him famous in the first place. Very logical when you consider where he creates, Israeli-Palestinian conflict plays a major topic within Addam's pieces - all the issues concerning the identity and borders commonly found in this struggle can be regularly found in his pieces. However, Yekutieli insists that he is not a pure political artist despite these theories[1]. By making distinct parallels between governmental conditions and emotional situations, it's obvious why some consider this artist's work as political. Due to his attempt to make a dialogue with the audience on a level based on emotional mechanism, Addam's output tends to be understood and participated in intuitively without relying on solely intellectual interpretation. As was said earlier, Yekutieli operates both on the street and inside a gallery. This rule enables him to make various pieces without limiting himself to one or two mediums. Yekutieli also enjoys combining ready-made materials, mixed media pieces, photographs and text within his artworks. However, putting the painting tools aside, he mainly loves composing his pieces by using detritus and building materials, including wood, bricks and weathered paper.   As for Addam Yekutieli's ongoing projects, there are a few that should really be noted at this point as they either are or will make a massive impact. Truth and Method is a project substantially based on realistic situations, continuing a well-established process of extensive observations of context whilst providing greater insight into a reflective practice. Images of planned site-specific street pieces form the basis of Truth and Method, with a series of emotional, text-based messages creating narratives reinforced by their circumstances. This vigorous and ongoing process invites us to understand our mutual reality through our own subjective personal experience and the photographs which are also planned expose us to moments from different environments, inviting us to try to find both personal and collective meaning in them. The project will hopefully stimulate feelings of belonging, solidarity and compassion. Vicariously Speaking is another existing new project the artist has in store for us. Since early 2016, the artist has been exchanging letters with imprisoned individuals currently serving sentences on death row in a Nashville state penitentiary. Following this correspondence, fragments of sentences from the inmates’ letters were extracted and put on a series of billboards around the city of Nashville. By taking these phrases out of their original context and placing them in a completely new one, thoughts of inmates take place in a public space and a dialogue within an interactive environment is created between two separate realities. In the future, these phrases will be tattooed onto people on the outside. Taking Sides is the last huge project the artist plans on executing at this point and is a bit less morbid than the Vicariously Speaking. Taking Sides aims to examine the idea of territory and the notion of adopting a stance, something all of us are familiar with. Generally, lines are drawn on the ground in order to mark two territories or express allegiance to certain ideals. These pieces, being placed in high-traffic public spaces allow an unavoidable interaction on behalf of the bypassers, with people constantly taking sides without even noticing, by simply walking down the sidewalk. The interventions are created in a specific manner, each responding to their environment and interacting with the people using the public space, allowing various images to be created in real time. These images will surely pack an emotional punch due to the deep meanings behind the written statements.  Due to his unique style, it comes as no surprise that this artist has worked and exhibited in many countries around the world. He created and presented pieces in Norway, Israel, Croatia, Gambia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. And in all of those countries, Yekutieli managed to do what he strived for - to make the detachment between the emotional and political non-existent. This way, Addam Yekutieli allows the viewers to see themselves placed in the larger context than their own and realizing some long-ignored dark truths of our society. This artist are represented by Lazarides London, Die Kunstagentin and Galerie Openspace.  References:    ",1908
Levalet,"Street art has been taking a huge upswing during the 21st century and we've truly seen some rather astonishing pieces adorn the streets of the cities throughout the world. Recognised by the art world as a movement, it started appearing even within the gallery walls and many have gained critical acclaim in those circles. One such artist is Charles Leval, aka Levalet, who not only creates amazing street art, he develops it in a personal style. A French artist who takes advantage of Paris’ architecture, combining his knowledge of theatre and painting especially, with a keen eye for topography, Levalet produces site-specific scenes painted with Indian ink.  He was born in Epinal and spent his youth in Guadeloupe where he experienced urban graffiti culture. He trained initially in Strasbourg, studying painting and then animation. Interested in video installations located on the streets, Levalet developed a style which focuses on an interaction between the subject of the artworks and the dimensions and features of the space they’re in. For Levalet, urban art is part of the identity of the city, and the technicality of defining private property gives the idea of public space a new dimension. Inspired by the likes of Blek le Rat, Krzysztof Wodiczko, and Zevs, Levalet aims to explore the architectural diversity of Paris, favoring alleys and passages which create an immediate intimacy with the viewer. A lot of thought goes into location too as each piece usually interacts with its environment in one way or another. “Topography is very important for me, this is why I always check a place out before I work on it, I try to mix the world of representation with the real world by playing on the physical cohesion of the situations I put up. Architecture supports my work. Then I work on staging the artwork with photographs.”   This artist injects humor into the streets of Paris by gluing animal and human-shaped paste-ups onto walls. Levalet also fills concrete recesses and jagged sidewalks with black-and-white figures. His paste-up people made in ink on white Kraft and then glued walls, first spotted on Colossal, end up interacting with their environments in interesting ways. In one work, two paper and ink fencers battle with a real umbrella, collapsing two dimensions into a single installation. Levalet has created realistic street art figures across the streets of Paris. His work was achieved by careful location of the perfect spots and accurate measurements as well as inspirations when drawing. Charles Leval, also known as Tourist traffic, moves in the balance between poetry and social protest. His pieces are dynamic and dark paste-up tell everyday moments through paradox or aggravation, being critical and playful at the same time. His pieces, interacting with their environment, hide, climb, and often include three-dimensional objects transformed into urban installations.  Featured image: Charles Leval.

MadC,"Claudia Walde, better known by her alias MadC is a graffiti artist from Germany who is known for her impressive graffiti works. Although she created thousands of wall pieces, what brought her the most fame and fortune were her large-scale outdoor works that literally take your breath away. The artist has managed to create a personal universe of forms, colors and fonts that make sure her work is instantly recognizable. MadC is mostly based in her home country, but ever since her rise to stardom in 2010, she has been working around the world and it is possible to find her graffiti in many metropolises of the Old Continent and America.  MadC was born in 1980, in Bautzen, Germany, as Claudia Walde. She started her artistic experimentations as a teenage girl, back in a time when Walde was attempting to paint her first graffitis in her neighborhood. She proved to be a quick learner - Claudia's first graffiti piece was in 1996, in the time when she was a little over 16 years of age. While she was developing her urban art skills tirelessly, Walde never lost track of her education - in fact, she managed to graduate from two different schools while simultaneously learning to paint murals! She holds degrees in Graphic Design from the University of Art and Design in Halle and Central Saint Martins College in London. Such a combination of two far apart worlds, one academic and the other more street-wise, proved to be a key moment in MadC's career. It is this confluence of situations – immediate connection with the street art subculture and a devoted approach to art research – which has been decisive in turning Claudia into the artist she is today. Since she began developing her talent at an early age, MadC managed to broaden her creative endeavors on many fronts - such as writing and fine art, as well as graphic design which she studied at her collages. She recently made a bold decision to transport her work indoors as she started to paint on canvases too. By transforming her work into gallery pieces, MadC investigated the relationship between overlapping colors, light, glass and calligraphic movement, as well as the differences and similarities between seemingly opposite mediums. Some of her more famous works on canvas are Nineteen Nineteen and Twenty One Zero Six - both of who had a recognizable ratio of black and white, characteristic for MadC's early tags. By her own claim, she is influenced by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and the graffiti painter Dare (for whom Claudia dedicated a few mural pieces).    Besides the inevitable spray paint without which there is no graffiti, MadC has been known to use other techniques, such as ink, watercolor, acrylic paint and acrylic markers. Her work incorporates elements common in science fiction and fantasy worlds which Walde obviously enjoys in her personal life. But, without any further delay, it is time to dive right into MadC's masterpiece, an already iconic mural titled simply as 700 Wall. This large graffiti can be seen along the train line between Berlin and Halle and it stands as a reminder, an insight into a specific period of the artist's work. The incredible piece represents at least two levels of MadC’s creative capabilities: on the one hand, it is an homage to a meticulous approach to craftsmanship and, on the other, it resonates an intricate exploration of the artist’s visual language and its boundaries. On this wall, MadC told the story of a graffiti writer in various scenes and painted her name more than 100 times in diverse interpretations and esthetics. This big project covers over 700 square meters and is a real graffiti milestone - both for street art in general and MadC personally, for whom this project proved to be a real springboard that launched her into the stars of urban art. It could be said that, after this piece, MadC became ready to start building her unique aesthetic universe. This is exactly what she did with a new body of work which was a part of Reflections show at Kolly Gallery during 2014 and The Tahiti Mural in Tahiti, during the same year. The seemingly reduced aesthetics of MadC’s canvases and street artwork show a devotion to the exploration of roots of an entire subculture. MadC confronts us with the notion of addressing the essence of graffiti and urban art cultures, in a way that highlights the importance of a never-ending (re)interpretation of the two concepts. A “traditional” subject matter is re-contextualized into a completely new visual language. All of this can be attributed to her equally important street and academic education.    Much about MadC's art can be found out by reading her two books she published in 2007 and 2011 - both were published under her birth name, so do not be confused. As a young investigator of an entire movement - she carried out this research in her twenties - Claudia showed remarkable cultural and anthropological insight. In Sticker City – Paper Graffiti Art (2007), she explores the culture of hand-painted and hand-crafted posters and stickers. The significance of the book lies in Claudia’s success in capturing the transformation of the graffiti movement, enabling the reader to understand the evolutionary path of an entire art form. She offers first-hand explanations of how she developed her own style and, as a result, how the urban art reacted and evolved alongside her. The cultural comparative analysis is enriched with a large number of cities and artists which had been explored. For the other publication, Street Fonts – Graffiti Alphabets from Around the World, Claudia embarks on a different kind of reflection – one determined by an anthropological query and an artistic dialogue. 154 artists from 30 countries were asked to design the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. If the first book reflects the myth of the street art movement, this one undoubtedly conveys its logos. Finally, the spring of 2015 brings a publication focusing on leading mural artists and major murals from various corners of the world. Here, Claudia, the author, takes up the role of an experienced muralist herself. Both books are noted for being written in a way that everyone can enjoy them, no matter if they ever researched urban art before or are the masters of the medium. It should also be noted that, although MadC primarily works solo, she is also a part of a few graffiti crews - Bandits, Wallnuts and Stick up Kids.  Ultimately, what is there to say about MadC that would be a worthy conclusion for such an artist? She managed to establish some incredibly crucial aspects of the medium, painted the world's most impressive graffiti, created an amazing visual dictionary, painted some of the most beautiful urban art pieces in recent history - and achieved all that before she was even thirty years of age. Her versatility, fanatical dedication and sheer talent are the Holy Trinity that will make sure the name of MadC will be on the lips of street art fans for years to come. An incredible artist without whom we do not even want to imagine how the urban art would look. The artist is represented by 44309 Street Art Gallery in Dortmund, Galerie Brugier-Rigail in Paris and Kolly Gallery in Zurich.

Martin Wong,"Martin Wong was born in Portland, Ore., in 1946 and grew up in San Francisco, where his parents worked for Standard Oil and the Bechtel Corporation. He received a degree in ceramics from Humboldt State University in Arcata, Calif., and joined the Angels of Light, a mystically oriented gay street performance troupe in San Francisco. At 30 Wong decided to become a painter and, not wanting to return to school, began an arduous process of self-education. Wong arrived in New York in 1978, settling into an apartment on the Lower East Side and supporting himself with a job in the bookstore of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He first exhibited his work in 1981 at ABC No Rio on Rivington Street on the Lower East Side in an exhibition organized by Colab, an artists' group known for its impromptu ''first come, first hung'' shows, which were open to anyone while space lasted. At the opening Wong met  Miguel Pinero, the poet and prize-winning playwright of ''Short Eyes'' and a well-known figure on the Lower East Side. For the next few years Mr. Pinero was Mr. Wong's close friend and mentor, introducing him to the underbelly of the local art, poetry and drug scenes and providing entree to the local Hispanic community that figures so prominently in his paintings of the 80's. Mr. Wong made many portraits of Mr. Pinero, based several paintings on his prison experiences (the inspiration for ''Short Eyes'') and incorporated poems by Mr. Pinero into several paintings, which he considered collaborations. Mr. Pinero died in 1988. Martin Wong, a painter whose meticulous visionary realism is among the lasting legacies of New York's East Village art scene of the 1980's and a precursor of the identity-driven work of the 90's, died 1999 at his parents' home in San Francisco. He was 53 and had lived in San Francisco since 1994. He died of AIDS-related causes, said Barry Blinderman, a close friend and director of Illinois State University Galleries in Normal, Ill.",1911
Sr. X,"Sr. X was born at the beginning of the 80’s in a small town in the north of Spain. After following several Arts degrees, he started to bring his ideas to the street trying to get city people to stop, think or just smile for a moment when they saw his work, briefly forgetting their daily routine. Some of his inspirations are pop culture, films, publicity and urban legends, which he normally gives expression to through stencils, paste-ups or installations. His creations are often wrapped in a distinct tone of irony and social criticism, frequently shrouded by a veil of sharp humor. In addition to his work in the streets, he likes to experiment with mixing street art techniques and more traditional elements such as acrylics, oil and collage in his studio, bringing his canvas creations one step forward with a more polished and elaborated process. He has participated in numerous art festivals, exhibitions and projects, and he enjoys leaving some of his work in the cities he visits. Working mainly in Gijon, Sr.X takes inspiration from pop culture, movies and urban legends, sometimes masking his provocative messages as vintage advertisements.",1912
Jean-Baptiste Bernadet,"Fluent in a number of styles, minimalist, monochromatic, gestural, impressionistic, and quite potent in working on scales both small and large, Jean-Baptiste Bernadet is a French contemporary painter whose works hovers between what is abstract and what is recognizable. Accepting the fact that there is no certainty in life, he hopes (and manages) to reflect that uncertainty through his paintings. Without limiting himself to just one approach with a linear structure, he has developed a visual language where everything is somehow interconnected. If there is a constant in Bernadet’s work, it’s that there is no constant. He is dependably restless and mercurial, always exploring painting’s many dialects.[1]  Painting begins with an impression. It varies from a simple observation in the streets, a phrase in the speech, a detail – pretty much anything that triggers that very first brushstroke on canvas. Through the process of covering and erasing, superimposition and simulation, the piece slowly arises. As for many artists of his generation, Bernadet considers an artwork to be the sum of time and energy devoted to it. Having gotten rid of some of the distractions that usually appear at the beginning of every young artist’s career (as he called it “the mystique of action painting, the pathos”), every one of his paintings records the history of its production, visible through the thickness of the successive layers of paint.[2] This layering path that Bernadet walks upon was first opened in the 1950’s by the Americans Frank Stella, Ad Reinhardt, and Kenneth Noland. Also, Claude Monet inevitably comes to mind when Bernadet’s paintings (the Fugue paintings) get closely inspected, not simply because of the appearance, but rather the inherent ability of the works to envelop the viewers into their own visual universe.   The artist was born in Paris but has lived in Brussels since 2000. He studied at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles, graduating in 2001, at the École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Rennes, obtaining a Master of Fine Arts degree in 2002, and at the ENSAV La Cambre, Brussels, where he completed his Master of Fine Arts in 2003. While each of his paintings can provide a good introduction to his process and the understanding of art, only at exhibitions could his talent be fully grasped. He had numerous successful solo shows, and from 2001 he’s also participated in many group exhibitions. Fugue paintings, observed from a distance, appear airy and atmospheric, a hazy veil of color suspended somewhere just before the picture plane. Only at first. Approaching the painting, the resplendent mist appears to part only to abruptly harden as each brushstroke comes into view and suddenly snaps into place, each delineating a block of pure color.[3] It is a challenge to look at a Fugue painting for too long, as their subversive formalism is destabilizing the conventional visual cues. Without draining his works of the pleasurable aspect of looking, Bernadet paints the pieces whose aesthetic beauty conceals a more sinister subversion of the very means by which that experience is delivered to us - our visual senses.

Gregory Siff,"American artist Gregory Siff is known for his signature ""storyboards"" artworks that merge street art and abstraction elements. In his work, each icon is inspired by the artist's life, and they are pieces of DNA that carry a visual record of Siff's life and emotional and creative mind. To celebrate the creation of an artwork, the artist prefers to work with primary colors exclusively. His work has been exhibited in numerous cities around the globe, including Vancouver, New York, Dublin, London, and Italy. He has had many commissions throughout his career, including Sotheby's, Mercedes Benz, Tumblr, Red Bull, Christie's, and Vans. Siff's is also exhibited in a number of corporate spaces, such as Deitch Projects, Swizz Beatz's Dean Collection, Soho House New York, and Google HQ. Gregory Siff was born in Brooklyn in 1977. Influenced by a household full of colorful paintings, young Siff was encouraged to visit museums and explore the world of art from a young age. However, after he moved to West Coast, he finally began making friends in the art world. His work, which blends elements from the fine, pop, street, and abstract art, was shown for the first time in 2006 in a solo exhibition titled the heartfirebreathemanifesto at Standard Hotel in Hollywood. The artist donated all the proceeds from the exhibit to Justice By Uniting in Creative Energy. Inspired by ""real life, highs and lows, and chocolate shakes,"" Siff creates a visual storyboard of his life that immediately starts dialogues. Siff's acting career began on the New York City Opera stage at Lincoln Center. Since then, he has performed, written, and produced numerous theater p, films, and TV shows, including From Justin To Kelly, The Nothing Boys, The Final Days, C.S.I.: NY., Rome & Jewel, From Justin to Kelly, Nurse Jackie and How to Make It in America. For the video game Grand Theft Auto, he recorded a voice for Rocco Pelosi's character. As an Art Ambassador for Vans Custom Culture (2013), Siff's work inspired younger generations of artists across the US. The Whitney Museum of American Art held the artist's hand-painted pair of Vans on display. In order to raise funds for the people affected by diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS, Siff successfully collaborated with Project Angel Food and Helmut Lang. The result of this project was 21 limited edition Helmut Lang t-shirts painted by the artist himself. These unique artworks were quickly sold out at Helmut Lang's store. Gregory Siff has participated in numerous group exhibitions worldwide, including the group show titled Precognito/Incognito 10 at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, Rockaway! charity exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art PS1 and charity art auction, the Art of Elysium's 7th Annual Pieces of Heaven. The latest exhibitions include Matter and Form at The House of Fine Art in London and a group exhibition titled In Soliloquy at The House of Fine Art in Mykonos. Gregory Siff lives and works in Los Angeles. Featured image: Gregory Siff - Dream Recording #2. Paintings; 76.2 x 76.2 cm. Courtesy HOFA Gallery (House of Fine Art)",1914
Alo,"ALO is an Italian street artist who usually paints middle-size portraits, as his style is quite detailed. ALO's work often looks like paste ups. They are not, every one of them is drawn in situ but he often chooses to paint over old posters that have been fly posted already onto the walls. And that is what gives the effect of a paste up. ALO describes his style as “Urban Expressionism”.   ALO was born in Italy and he is a self-taught. He took some drawing lessons at ""Industrial Design"" while living in Florence, but quit soon as he did not appreciate making art for advertisement purposes. In Italy, he began with oil painting to then move towards a mixed media one, using in particular acrylics and marker pens. His work is mainly focused on human figure in a portrait-style and his characters started to appear on the walls really soon: first all over Italy, in particular Perugia, Milan and Rome, and then London.  Although it may seem contradictory, ALO is a “street art painter”. He adapted his indoor techniques, mainly acrylic based, to the outdoor surfaces. The use of brushes and markers determine the striped pixelated look of his portraits that deliver a strong sense of loss and defeat. The bright tones of the backgrounds, most of the time primary colors, define the meaning and emotional range of each artwork. ALO’s outdoor pieces are slowly processed; the work is diluted in many phases of preparation of the surface and details are carefully layered.  After a short period based on different street art techniques, ALO began painting his portraits directly on walls using the same technique employed for his indoor works, based on brushes and markers. When he moved to London he started painting his striated box characters on the East-End area, mostly on the streets of Shoreditch, Brick Lane and Hackney. His work is a provocative blend of the tribal and the conceptual. With statements like Poor vs Poor and False Flag adorning some of these paintings, he is adding a political tone to his art's expression. ALO’s works are not merely just paintings; they are a social commentary of the age.  Even though he is well known by his carefully crafted details, he has painted huge works as well, but generally the middle-size paintings are quick enough to be painted properly and illegally. The aim of his street art is to bring a painting-style on walls. His street-portraits have often a painted frame that cages the character and gives the impression of a framed painting. His style is characterized by line-textures and color contrasts, he usually replaces objects or parts of the human body with the equivalent words. In this way the viewer will imagine the object through the word symbolizing the object itself.   ALO’s style is unique and immediately identifiable, but he says that he is never able to really describe his style: “I need to paint people, characters of the reality I live; it’s like a research into a human being’s feelings and troubles.” He uses the same technique each time but each character still has its own personality. Dotted around the East End, his work can be seen: “I like the idea of doing something for everyone” he says “something not sellable”. As ALO comes from the streets, it was natural to him to bring his paintings on walls, as he feels much closer to the street world than the ""traditional painters"" one. ALO spots his characters in the streets, where he brings them back in the form of works of art: Hail to the Looser, as the title of ALO’s last exhibition invites to do. “I’ve always been drawn to this outside society. Myself, I feel I belong most to this aspect of mankind.” He's often inspired by the outsiders living his own area. At the same time, he portraits not only beggars, prostitutes and junkies but also the so-called ""normal"" people who suffer life but tend to hide and renegade their own inner feelings. His whole work is based on bringing to surface the deeper human feelings through colors and shapes.  His views on street art are forthright: “I think anyone has the right to paint walls” he says, “overcoming the so-called ‘experts’ who are supposed to decide who’s an artists and who’s not.” Yet at the Saatchi, it will be the ‘experts’ who will end up judging his work, it’s a big step up but it’s the one that’s been given with the support of art insiders who have obviously seen something special in this quiet abstract street painter.  Regarding the intentions of street art in general, ALO says ""it’s revolutionary"". He talks through his art; his canvases and street pieces have an incredible communicative power. Despite him being a self-taught artist, ALO’s works are largely inspired by the milestones of art history. A careful observer can’t avoid noticing the connections with many of the artistic movements born just before World War II all over Europe. ALO is influenced by African art where its “losers” try to send us messages through a labyrinth of cubist rebus of words and objects; they stare at us under a never ending brush strokes rain. All portraits have the same void Demoiselles d’Avignon eyes, but they are at the same time full of emotions: sweetness, love, desperation, anger, madness. Long necks and beautiful stylized women; people in the city corners, at the very margins of life, the same favorite subjects of the German Expressionists. He has mostly been influenced by the idea of working on something not sellable and for anyone. Even if he appreciates many street art styles, his aim is to bring something different to street art, detaching from pop-art, cartoon style and stencils.    Another big influence is the concept of street art itself explaining that he likes the idea of the artist taking back the spaces we live in for the purpose of creation. He states Kirchner as his prime role-model, and if looked carefully, one can catch a glimpse of the great painter’s contour in ALO’s portraits as well. His modern characters thus become symbolic, transforming from supposed individuals into archetypes. When ALO explains these influences I find myself understanding his art more. I can see how the combination of expressionism and African art works and when you put in on the street, how the three fuse together. The style that distinguishes him has been developed step by step in about ten years, and his most important art has been developed in the UK capital. In London, his work has been shown at the ""Stolen space"" gallery in the ""Winter group show"" in 2013 and in his first UK solo show ""Hail to the loser""  (this title is implicating the thematics and the philosophy of this street art renegade) at the Saatchi Gallery in July 2014.

Liu Bolin,"Chinese contemporary artist Liu Bolin has become internationally recognized for his camouflage art. Known as 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Human Chameleon', he has developed a technique of painting himself into ordinary backgrounds. Fusing performance, photography, and protest, Bolin creates amazing works that deal with to the different emerging social problems that accompany China’s rapid economic growth. He has exhibited his work nationally and internationally in such countries as France, the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Israel, Italy, Venezuela, Argentina, and more.  Liu Bolin was born in Shandong, an eastern Chinese province on the Yellow Sea in 1973. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Shandong College of Arts in 1995 and his Master of Fine Arts from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing in 2001. Liu belongs to the generation that came of age in the early 1990s when China emerged from the rubble of the Cultural Revolution and was beginning to enjoy economic growth and relative political stability. In the world’s most populous country, state-society relations have been ground for making controversial artworks including Tank Man — one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century depicting the lone man in front of the tank at Tiananmen Square in 1989, or Study in Perspective by Ai Weiwei — showing the artist flipping the middle finger against some of the most famous places across the globe. Both works voice political dissidence and pose questions to the authority. In this sociopolitical tradition stands the art of Liu Bolin who discusses the social concerns of his home country through his artistic practice, most notably through his ‘camouflage’ installations.  His series Hiding in the City was born out of the governmental eviction and subsequent destruction of his Beijing studio in 2005. After Chinese police destroyed Suo Jia Cun, the Beijing artists' village in which he'd been working (because the government did not want artists working and living together), with the help of assistants, he painstakingly painted his clothes, face, and hair to blend into the background of a demolished studio. This was then documented as a series of photographs and so the ‘invisible man’ was born. His iconic series have included performances in Beijing, Paris and New York and have captured the imagination of a global audience. Using his own body as a canvas, painting himself into the background, he creates the scene that is a statement about our relationship to our surroundings, and reflections on Chinese artists and their status in modern China. To produce his works, Liu often chooses sites replete with the symbols of China's Cultural Revolution or suggestive of the immense changes in the country since the fall of Zedong’s regime. For all of his Invisible Man (as the public began to call the artist himself) photographs, Liu always wears his Chinese military uniform as he employs concealment as a method for addressing aspects of identity and appearance.   Liu Bolin has been working on different subsequent themes through the years. Sculptures, as his photographs, show how the outside can blend with the inside and vice versa. Liu Bolin’s work requires meticulous planning and execution. It all lies in the perfection of the vision, whether it is an illusion or just a mirror surface. Liu Bolin uses the city around him as a backdrop, covering himself in a paint and fades into the backdrop of a photographed scene. By literally blending into the city, Liu creates a tension that challenges the viewer to question what is above and beneath the surface. For the artist, the most important element of his images is the background. Each image requires rigorous planning and execution: as both artist and performer, Liu directs the photographer on how to compose each scene before entering the frame. With the help of assistants, he is painting his own body to match a portion of the chosen site, before photographing himself standing within the scene as he blends into the background. He said his work requires a lot of patience with him having to pose and work on his photographs for more than ten hours at a time to get it just right - the tension between his body and the landscape is an important aspect of the process.  After his first solo show in Beijing in 1998, Bolin’s work became worldly recognized and since then, he has participated in numerous individual and collective shows, festivals, and projects. To celebrate  American President Barack Obama's visit to China in 2009, Liu made an effigy (a representation of a specific person in the form of sculpture or some other three-dimensional medium) of the president in his honor – made out of very traditional sculpture material, bronze, this sculpture of Obama is based on a Time magazine image of him. The statue is peppered with tiny holes for gas flames which engulf the statue giving it a nightmarish and satanic look unintended by the artist. Fiery flames are one of the 'Twelve Symbols' found on Chinese Imperial robes. It represents the Summer Solstice and the renewable energy of the emperor himself. However, the main impression of the work is one of the unintended consequences. Because it deals with a controversial political figure both at home and abroad, it speaks immediately to the viewer's own political orientation. The artist said he doesn't mean for the piece, called Burning Man Obama, to be seen as an attack. The Burning Man Obama controversy was propelled by the internet. Bolin finished this piece just in time for Obama’s visit. He posted a photo of it on the Internet and it almost instantaneously made his work famous.   The Heroic Apparition was Bolin's first solo show in the UK. It was another wonderful series of politically themed works based on exploring identity and the position of the artist in China. Although Bolin’s oeuvre includes sculpture, performance and photography, it is these ‘camouflage’ images that have become his signature style. So visually intriguing and playful, the works convey an unequivocal political stance and are implicitly potent in content. His exhibition A Colorful World? at Klein Sun Gallery in New York in October 2014, featured new sculptures, photographs, and light boxes referencing to the innumerable multicolored advertisements and consumer products that cloud today’s understanding of oppression and injustice. The exhibition was a true testament to Bolin’s artistic versatility, as well as an expression of his perspective on global issues of culture, society, and politics.  Bolin’s In Magazine stainless-steel sculptures camouflage a casted face into the background of more than a dozen hand-painted magazines covers. The concern about losing our individual identities among commercial images found in magazines is a problem Bolin is obviously very interested in. Seems like the more we consume these products, the more we begin transforming into it until we disappear and completely lose our individuality. The largest work in the series yet, Cancer Village camouflages twenty-three individuals – who have been affected by a 100% increase in the rate of cancer-related mortality within their rural Chinese village – into a portrait of farm land with an ominously looming chemical factory in the background. The photograph exposes their plight and highlights their current position within Chinese society – that of complete invisibility and non-existence. Those who could prevent their continually increasing mortality rate choose to ignore the individuals featured in this photograph and thereby render them invisible well before and long after the photograph was taken.  The Creators Project is a global platform that features the works of visionary artists across multiple disciplines that are using technology to push the boundaries of creative expression. There are more than 600 Creators from around the world. Participating artists include Karen O, Daft Punk, Spike Jonze, M83, Benh Zeitlin, Animal Collective, Chris Milk, Takeshi Murata, Andrew Huang, Vega Zaishi Wang, Mick Rock, David Bowie and Barney Clay… And, Liu Bolin! In a photo series released in 2015, Bolin expanded his scope to create two new ""group"" portraits focused around the theme of British currency. Through a personal connection, director/producer and friend of The Creators Project, Jack Newman, was able to join his cast of acting non-actors, to be painted into a large-scale portrait of scattered British coinage. Provided a computer with adequate image-editing capacities (Bolin is seen, on the right, using Photoshop), some patience, and a whole lot of acrylic paint, we could all take a page from Bolin's playbook and become invisible.  While many animal species display camouflage to became invisible and protect themselves against any danger that they sense within their habitats, the Chinese artist uses it to draw attention to the problems he finds relevant. By using his own figure as a living camouflaged sculpture, Bolin interacts with the space surrounding him bringing to surface what is otherwise invisible or ignored. His exploration of identity, human rights, state control and the relationship between human beings and the environment has positioned him as one of the most exciting and relevant contemporary artists working today.  He is represented by Magda Danysz Gallery in Shanghai and Paris, and Fabien Castanier Gallery in Culver City, CA, USA.

Van Ray,"Van Ray is a German street artist, one of the most famous members of a young German artists' guard who have taken their first steps on the artistic road. His art, mostly characterized as street or urban art, makes use of various stencil techniques on vintage materials.  Van Ray's career began with public graffiti at the end of the 90s when he started using his art to communicate with the general public and to demonstrate social criticism. His works were based on various techniques (including stencils, stickers, paste-ups, and sculptures) and meant to express his view of Western society. He started as a teen, by doing profane graffiti. During the day, he used to perpetuate his work on the walls of the former slaughterhouse. Eventually, Van Ray wanted to use the graffiti as a means of communication. The mid-2000s he took art classes because he had realized that his craftsmanship armor - like drawing and painting - was missing. For him, art is a craft that you can definitely learn. Van Ray was born in 1984 in Düsseldorf, and he grew up under the influence of the Parisian “Pochoir Movement” during the 80s. As a result of this early force of this kind of art, which prevalent implicates art as an expression of social criticism in public, he began to express his own view of society with the help of graffiti. Due to personal maturation and developed abilities to deal with ubiquitous social and political problems of the Western society, Van Ray broadened his artistic on-hand skills by redeveloping methods like using stencils, stickers, paste-ups and sculptures. This incremental development is also reflected in his public work. As a result of a personal wrap in 2007, accompanied by a movement to Cologne, Van Ray took this opportunity to establish the artist collaboration “fancyroom” which could be seen as an elaborate try to create a symbiosis of design and street art. The results were used by several textile manufactures as part of their products. Van Ray started simultaneously to offer general public access to mainly printed work by exhibitions. The collaboration dissolved in 2010.  Nowadays, Van Ray's work reflect a fusion of street art, pop art and qualified nonsense, retaining the basic elements of his distinctive artistic style without losing sight of his intended social criticism. His work is characterized by its detailed stencils on mostly rusty vintage materials such as iron sheets, vending machines and enamel signs or wooden slats. On the relationship between art and protest, Van Ray commented: ""Rebellion does not derive from the use of a certain technique, but rather from the color of your tie."" His works are all signed with the ""duck signature symbol"". These arrangements can be contemplated in galleries from Cologne over Rome to Shanghai. He is represented by 30works Galerie in Köln, and Galerie Hegemann in München, Germany. Van Ray currently lives and works in Cologne, Germany.",1917
Katrin Fridriks,"Katrin Fridriks is an Icelandic conceptual artist, the vanguard of a new abstract expressionism movement. Fridriks was born in Reykjavík, Iceland and she’s been active at the art scene for more than 10 years. Katrin is known for fusing natural energies of her native Iceland with an organic, abstract expressionism together with Japanese calligraphy, sometimes filtered through conceptual installations. Elements from the contemporary pop art and graffiti culture can also be seen in her works.  Although Katrin’s first love and passion was architecture, she ended up studying calligraphy which definitely influenced her characteristic work - learning the technique of executing a letter in one brush stroke triggered what today has become a chorographical painting process. What points her out is that in her artworks Katrin Fridriks addresses controversial scientific innovation – and that includes genetic research and cloning, with amorphous color splashes on finely crafted materials and sleek surfaces. While exploring ties between science and art, Katrin distils her questions about human life and its future. In her native Iceland, a government-backed pharmaceutical company named DeCode controversially keeps a DNA database of the country's citizens. A part of that genetic code and its classification adventure can be observed, for example, in her work Gene&Ethics. Other themes she refers are the flux of information in a technology-based context, and the natural resources expressing the consequences of human activities on Earth.  The architectural dimensions of Katrin’s paintings highlight her interest for large-scale works and compositions of painting - playing with the size, thickness and format of the canvases. However, pictorial process she brings is taking her to the enlargement of her drippings - from swings to even covering the whole canvas sometimes. Katrin acts as a trigger for natural processes, chemical reactions, which create fractal structures on the paintings‘surfaces. These processes give Fridrik‘s paintings a quite uncommon depth. Fridriks have been compared to Jackson Pollok for her color-rich compositions with tangles of drips and brushstrokes. Her work is richly colorful, to the extent that it supercharges the imagination but she also paints monochromatic works—black on white, and white on black. In 2013, Katrin created a work titled Silver Three Crayon Installation that presents her abstract paintings on three-dimensional, modernist sculptural forms. Key concepts for the series where this piece belongs to are: wave-particle duality, harmonic oscillation, and linear functional.    Katrin Fridriks has been internationally exhibited and she received high-profile grants from the Ministry of Culture, Higher Education & Re­search in Luxembourg in 2009, and from private Companies such as the Goss-Michael Foundation for the MTV Re-define project in 2011 and 2014, Ralph Lauren Foundation in 2010, the Biennial of Liverpool and the Centre of Icelandic Art in 2008… In 2007, Fridriks received a high-profile commission from the French Government to create Red Sea, an 80 m² fresco for the Olympic Stadium of Nîmes.   Although Katrin is best known for large-scale paintings, her truly contemporary artistic practice originates in an early engagement with Performance Art with her project Dust of Galaxy, in 2002 or Land Art presented through Energy Flow in 2004.   Fridriks began to work on installation too: her ensemble Molecular Spaces in 2008 where she focused on transforming her pictures into three-dimensional theatrical settings. In 2014, Circle Culture Gallery in Berlin showed Stendhal Syndrome as Katrin’s solo show. The title derivates from the series of works she has been producing as her visualization of “a psychosomatic disorder that causes rapid heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, confusion and even hallucinations when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing art“. The theme has been elaborated through the exhibited works and the overall setup, but most of all, through a captivating main installation of the show including a large canvas work that can be examined through a custom made magnifying glass.  In 2015, Katrin installed her large installation Perception of the Stendhal Syndrome at the Palazzo Bembo in Venice, Italy, as a part of the Personal Structures – Crossing Borders group exhibition opening at la Biennale di Venezia 2015. That same year, the first significant monograph dedicated to Katrin Fridriks was released by Skira editorial. Being released as part of their Artist Collection, this 250 page hardcover edition provides a unique journey into the artist’s universe and past 15 years of Fridriks’ creation and evolution. The main focus is on her latest and most innovative paintings and shows. The author is Fiamma Arditi, an Italian writer and journalist based in New York.  ",1918
Pejac,"Silvestre Santiago, better known as Pejac, is a Spanish artist whose street art combines elements of surrealism and fantasy executed in his signature minimalist style. Through his clever use of symbols, Pejac manages to prove to all of us that street art does not necessarily have to be graffiti. His subtle and intelligent work covers topics such as freedom, peace and poetry. His simple yet powerful murals and site-specific installations cleverly interact and incorporate the surrounding architectural features into the compositions. Besides street art pieces, Pejac is also an accomplished painter and illustrator on more traditional surfaces like canvas.   Pejac was born in Santander, Cantabria in 1977 and studied Fine Arts in Salamanca and subsequently in Barcelona. In 2001, he continued his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Milano. Pejac initially started creating street art when he became disillusioned with the elitist attitudes of his art teachers. Instead, he decided to bring art to everyone, even those who would never visit a museum or gallery. He started working in the streets in 2000 while living in Milan, Italy. After leaving that city, his urge for public transgression had kind of disappeared until about few years ago. Today, Pejac’s paintings can be found on walls in Moscow, Paris, Istanbul, London and Milan. Pejac primarily paints with only black but sometimes uses splashes of color in his works. His paintings always touch on social-economic themes and deal with topics such as peace, freedom and politics.  Pejac seems comfortable working on the smallest drawing to the largest outdoor mural. While his ideas and motivations are often crystal clear, it is his minimalism and subtractive techniques that make his work truly stand out. Pejac often uses trompe l’oeil to fool our eye in everyday places. Trompe l'oeil literarily translates from French to ""eye trap"". His skilled artworks perfectly blend colors and textures to give them the appearance that you could reach out and touch them.   Pejac paints both playful and serious scenes, often using silhouetted figures. A young girl – a giant – uses the power of a magnifying glass and the sun to set tiny figures on fire. Another person attempts to deface a wall, but the splatter features Manet’s iconic The Luncheon on the Grass. And, in a more poignant piece, a portrait of the world appears to run down a sewage drain. The common thread of Pejac’s work is that it is all clever – this artist takes everyday outdoor features and manipulates them in subtle and diverse ways: ""The least interesting thing for me is the texture, color, or wall size. What I care about is the urban context...in some works I clearly work with optical distortions/illusions, with the sole intention to not only play with the concept but with the very perception of reality.""    Known for his minimalist motifs frequently using optical illusions, Pejac displayed his talents by painting, during his travels in Istanbul in 2014, three different pieces on the walls of the Asian neighborhood of Üsküdar, which he gave the name Lock, Poster and Shutters. The three wall paintings are meant to represent the ""perception and illusion of freedom."" The artist explains in a statement: ""I’ve painted these Trompe l'oeils in the same zone of Uskudar (Asian Istanbul), very close one from another in order to establish a physical bond between them. In the case of these three windows the trap works in both directions: from outside to inside and from inside to outside.""  Among his most interesting projects is one on the shores of Cantabria in northern Spain – it is painting a rusty and abandoned ship, recreating a scene from a hundred forty or so years earlier over the harbor of Le Havre, France. Pejac decided to paint one of Monet’s most famous impressionist paintings on its side. The original Monet work, Impression, Sunrise was the inspiration for the very term Impressionism that was eventually applied to an entire movement of French painters who eschewed the rigidity of realism in favor of intuitional readings of light and movement in the material world. The piece is not just a simple Monet recreation on the side of a boat, this one is partially hidden depending on the tide - the ocean itself reveals and obscures the painting. ""I think that the rusted metallic hull of this semi-sunk ship gives life to the image. With the daily sea tides of the Cantabric ocean the work is constantly above and below water,"" he says, and because of it, ""the sea acts as a theater curtain.""  From works on paper to this kind of different interventions involving various concepts and techniques (like painting on the silk for his Seppuku collection), this skilled artist is able to show and tell so much by painting minimally, bringing new meaning to the term ""site-specific"". His diverse and inventive works often use their surroundings as part of the entire image, and with subtle intervention, achieves fantastic effects. Playing with the perspective, repetitiveness, dimension, reusing textures and intervening his objects, characters and elements, are some of the signature methods of getting to the point. It is these visual contradictions and illogicalities that are one of his strongest weapons, which immerses the viewer with their simplicity and power. About his artistic expression, Pejac says: “Both melancholy and humor are the locomotives of my works. They create a poetic language whose essence doesn’t rely on simple beauty, but on the hidden side of everything. People’s reactions make me go on. Adult life is pure inertia, which seems to be broken only by bad news or incentives, and if I can make people think, it all makes sense.”    In 2015, Pejac began his Asia tour and made a series of site-specific works inspired by the culture and atmosphere of Hong Kong and Tokyo. One of the works from the series, titled Tagger, depicts a dragon, traditional symbol of power and strength in Chinese culture. Located on the busy streets of Hong Kong Central, this fire-blowing mythical animal became tamed and domesticated, painted along with the universal symbol of love – the heart which Pejac made using a blow torch. Another piece which Pejac created features the MSN Hotmail Butterfly trapped in a glass jar. The work, named Oppression, was intentionally placed and left in front of the Central Government Complex of Hong Kong, the place where Umbrella Revolution protests were focused on in the previous year. Trapped, the Oppression butterfly metaphorically represents the lack of free speech and limited social communication determined by the repressive Chinese laws. It remains unknown what exactly happened to the jar. Pejac’s last work created in the Hong Kong series most successfully illustrates his perception of time and tense environment. Painted on a hotel window, the Re-Thinker piece is inspired by the Auguste Rodin’s famous sculpture. The idea that lies behind Re-Thinker came to Pejac’s mind while observing the city of Hong Kong and the locals. The artist felt like people, in a lack of time and space or maybe caused by the rhythm of the city, are not left to think for themselves.  Pejac usually uses brushes, pencils, acrylic paint and sand paper to create pieces that blend into their surroundings. Much of his art breaks outside the confines of the usual space in order to transpose work beyond its normal boundaries. Some of his gallery work, for example, literally breaks through the frames to create something visually striking but also challenging. Such a convention is a logical extension for a street artist, however, and much of Pejac’s work outside the gallery uses the breaking of normal limits to attract attention and challenge viewpoints.

Tom Sachs,"Tom Sachs is an American contemporary artist and sculptor best known for his elaborate recreations of various Modern icons, all of them masterpieces of engineering and design of one kind or another. Sachs re-envisions modern iconography, popular and industrial inventions of the 20th century. This contemporary revision of the nativity scene received great attention  and demonstrated Sachs' interest in the phenomena of consumerism, branding, and the cultural fetishization of products. Born in 1966 in New York, he studied architecture at London's Architectural Association School of Architecture. Around 1990 he found a studio in the disappearing machinery district downtown. His studio, Allied Cultural Prosthetics, took its name from the previous tenant—Allied Machine Exchange—implying that contemporary culture had become nothing but a prosthetic for real culture. In an early show he made Knoll office furniture out of phone books and duct tape; later, he recreated Le Corbusier's 1952 Unité d'Habitation using only foamcore and a glue gun. Other projects have included his versions of various Cold War masterpieces, like the Apollo 11 Lunar Excursion Module, and the bridge of the battleship USS Enterprise. And because no engineering project is more complex and pervasive than the corporate ecosystem, he's done versions of those, too, including a McDonald's he built using plywood, glue, assorted kitchen appliances. He's also done Hello Kitty and her friends in materials ranging from foamcore to bronze. In fact, Tom Sachs doesn’t refrain from taking major luxury brands and ripping them out of their contexts. The themes central to his universe focus on American culture and society, which he treats with a heavy dose of humor and sarcasm. Attentive to detail and the finished result, he executes his work using both high and low materials. Most often, his models are created out of foam board, and some of his sculptures are cast in bronze. A lot has been made of the conceptual underpinnings of these sculptures: how Sachs' sampling capitalist culture, remixing, dubbing and spitting it back out again, so that the results are transformed and transforming. All the steps that led up to the end result are always on display. On a practical level, this means that all seams, joints, screws or for that matter anything holding stuff together, like foamcore and plywood, are left exposed. Nothing is erased, sanded away, or rendered invisible. On a more philosophical level, this means that nothing Sachs makes is ever finished. Like any good engineering project, everything can always be stripped down, stripped out, redesigned and improved. Tom Sachs lives and works in New York.",1920
David Ostrowski,"Creating minimalistic paintings, David Ostrowski uses primarily the white paint with the occasional scribbles of some other color, with the intention to make almost empty surfaces liberated from any outer influence. His works reach the astronomical sums at the auctions, despite the first impression which may be confusing. Abstract art is often a riddle and in the Ostrowski’s case, the maximum effect is achieved with minimal form and line engagement. The simplicity is reflected in the dense layer of the white paint and one or two colored lines that make the visual poetry.    Ostrowski graduated at Kunstakademie Dusseldorf under Albert Oehlen. His work has been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions in both Europe and the USA. Growing up in the artistic family, it was the natural path to become an artist. The painting was his occupation since always, and it was easy for him to reach the limits of figurative painting very quickly. When there was anything left to say, the process of removal from the pictorial narrative towards the incomprehensible was natural and a part of his attempt to create something new, something still unknown.  For him, painting is like looking the meaning in the nonsense. He is not interested in understanding, Ostrowski is trying to make his work simple as more as possible. Using the inexpensive materials, he stopped to paint in oil because of its great possibilities. Spray brings the limitation of the expression and forced him to work quickly. There are no corrections and only counts the first shot.  His creativity excludes the power to make decisions, but strong gesture and spontaneous style are allowing him to reveal unexpected and hidden possibilities.     In his F series of works, Ostrowski explores the conception of the error in painting, by using in the process of the creation equally the left hand, though he is a right-handed. In that way, he makes paintings that present a surprise even to himself. The letter F indicates the German phrase Fehler Malerei which means painting error. Aiming to create a tension, he stopped to manipulate himself and lost control, believing in the content of the painting and the autonomy of the medium. He uses to draw sketches, but during the time, he realized that his expression has more freedom when he is able to make the mistakes.    Having the high expectations, he considers that his pictures have to surprise him occasionally and they should never be stupid. Using the materials which he finds in the studio, like newspaper, stripes of wood or dirt, Ostrowski creates monumental pieces which represent the auto-portrait, depicting the vast emptiness, lack of motivation, but also the beauty, as the most important element.  The second part of his work are the installations or including the paintings into the gallery space, which is also the spontaneous act. With the constant aspiration to undermine the composition, the artist experiments with speed and imperfection, successfully integrating the errors into his pictorial composition. David Ostrowski is represented by Sprüth Magers, Berlin.   ",1921
My Dog Sighs,"My Dog Sighs's style is characterised by the combination of melancholic and often naive portraiture with the use of found materials including abandoned food cans.His work forms a narrative based on counterpointed poignancy that resonate with those that have the opportunity to find them. Moments of loss and then being found echo the materials used. After 10 years of giving his art away for free as part of the now infamous Free Art Friday project, My Dog Sighs has this year finally found himself strapped in to a well-deserved meteoric rise. With an incredible international following in Israel, Japan and of course the UK, five sold out shows under his belt, and a strong following of staunchly loyal fans on social media; My Dog Sighs is fast becoming an important figure on the contemporary art scene. ""My Dog Sighs' work forms a narrative based on counterpointed poignancy that resonate with those that have the opportunity to find them. Moments of loss and then being found echo the materials used. Tin cans, once the receptacle of our sustenance, all too quickly rejected, thrown away, abandoned by a materialistic society keen to gorge on the new"" Sell out solo exhibitions across the UK, US and Israel have brought his unique melancholic yet formidable talent to a new audience who might otherwise miss his subtle ecologically minded street work. Born from a desire to interact with the urban landscape and its inhabitants without impacting negatively on them, My Dog Sighs’ work forms a narrative based on counterpointed poignancy that resonate with those that have the opportunity to find them. Moments of loss and then being found echo the materials used. Tin cans, once the receptacle of our sustenance, all too quickly rejected, thrown away, abandoned by a materialistic society keen to gorge on the new.""",1922
Cindy Sherman,"Using the medium widely accepted as the one that reflects the reality in the most precise way, Cindy Sherman managed to achieve exactly the opposite effect, criticizing the subject through the idea of subjective nature of human intelligence and instability of visual perception. Beginning with the painting in hyper-realist style in the midst of the affirmation of American Feminism during the 1970’s, the artist shifted to photography aiming to explore the variety of female roles in the society. Questioning the seductive and often relentless influence of mass-media over both individual and collective identities, Sherman put herself in front of the camera, playing the fantasy game of pretending. Her extensive series of self-portraiture processes the themes of sexual desire and domination, pointing out the shaping of self-identity as mass deception and compromise between social obtrusions and personal intentions. Employing the elements of Hollywood movies, such as make-up, costumes, and scenery through the dramatic atmosphere of scenery images, her photos became common illusions, the reflection of concepts of celebrities, entertainment, sexual adventure, and similar social phenomena.  Cindy Sherman was born on January 19, 1954, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, but she grew up in Huntington, Long Island, where her family moved soon after she was born. Generally uninterested in art, her father was an engineer and mother a reading teacher, it was surprising when their youngest daughter chose to study visual arts at the State University of New York, at Buffalo. Starting as a painter, she was quickly faced with the limitations of this medium, finding the solution in photography. “There was nothing more to say. I was meticulously copying other art and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead”[1]. Although initially failed photography class as a freshman, she decided to repeat the course, which was only more convincing that she has chosen the right thing, probably because she studied under the Barbara Jo Revelle, the influential art instructor who introduced Sherman to Conceptual art and other progressive movements and media. At the college, she met Robert Longo, her intimate partner until 1979, Nancy Dwyer, and Charles Clough with whom she has founded Hallwalls, the Center for Contemporary Art, a multi-arts association that functions since 1974 to present day. After she finished her studies, Sherman moved to New York and in 1977 settled in her downtown home and studio where she began to work on her first series of photographs of herself, embodying the characters of “everywoman”. For the next three years, she played the roles of various female archetypes, from housewife and noble lady to prostitute, film noir siren, and pin-up girl, exhausting the myriad of timeless characters that refer to the feminine. Always working in series, the photographer works alone in her studio, photographing self-portraits in various roles, being an author, director, hairstylist, make-up artist, costume designer, and model at the same time. His first series, Untitled Film Stills, soon became her landmark. It consisted of 69 black and white photographs depicting Italian neorealism in American film noir of the 1940’s, 1950’s, and 1960’s. Avoiding the titles, every image was marked by number and conceptually they could be divided into several different groups. After three years, she decided to stop, running out of clichés. Since 1995, the series is a part of MoMA, New York collection and has been estimated $1 million.   With her Untitled Film Stills Sherman became a prominent member of the New York art scene, which provide her first solo show at The Kitchen, non-profit exhibition space and commissions for the magazines, although the one for a centerfold image for Artforum was rejected marked as too racy. It was never officially confirmed, but there were the speculations that her next series created from 1985 to 1989, Disasters and Fairy Tales, was a response to the act of rejection, considering the darker palette and the gloomy atmosphere of the scenes that provoke the viewer to find beauty in the ugly grotesque. In these two series, she used visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time. During the 1980’s Sherman started to use color film, very large prints and focused on lighting and facial expression which was evident in the series Rear Centerfolds/Horizontals (1981), inspired by fashion and pornographic magazines was commissioned, but never used by Artforum magazine. Once again, she played a young woman in the various roles, from seductress to scared victim. In 1982, she worked on Pink Robes series, larger than size-life images that showed close-ups of her wearing or holding the pink bathrobe. Imagined to look like the model just after the photo session, these photos reveal the real Cindy Sherman, deprived of any theatrical elements. As a response to controversy and censorship involving work of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery, she created her Sex Pictures (1989), removing herself from the scenes, finding the substitute in a doll. With the aim of shocking the making the scandal, she presented close-ups of dolls’ sex scenes with prosthetic genitalia. As the culmination of the 1980’s, Sherman made 35 large pieces as the reminiscent of the European portrait painting from 15th to the early 19th century, named History Portraits where she took over the subjects of Raphael’s La Fornarina, Caravaggio’s Sick Bacchus, and Judith Beheading Holofernes, or Fouquet’s Madonna of Melun. Living in the Europe during this period, her inspiration came directly from the art pieces kept in the greatest museums, although she actually never entered either of them, claiming that was not a fan of them. ""Even when I was doing those history pictures, I was living in Rome but never went to the churches and museums there. I worked out of books, with reproductions. It's an aspect of the photograph I appreciate, conceptually: the idea that images can be reproduced and seen anytime, anywhere, by anyone.""[2] Still, her Fornarina differs from the classic one, exposing her milk-swollen breasts made of plastic and fake pregnant belly, praising Sherman’s deconstruction of overtly masculine visions of the female in the history of art. Starting to incorporate prosthetic body parts selected from the medical catalogs, with every new series she used more and more artificial things and less Sherman herself. Sex Pictures introduced medical prosthesis in the service of pornography, as a comment on the objectification of both men and women, social taboo when it comes to sexuality and relationship between sex and violence.   Influenced by her husband, film director Michel Auder from whom she divorced in 1999, Sherman changed her still photography to motion pictures, making the directorial break-through with the movie Office Killer and acting debut in John Waters’ Pecker (1998) when she played herself. Over the last fifteen years, she became involved in digital manipulations, like in the series Clowns Cycle, where it enabled her to add garnish background and montages of numerous characters. She went further in Society Portraits where are the representations of one undetermined woman placed in opulent sets and rounded with the ornate frames. The exhibition at MoMA in 2012 showed photographic mural, her first transformation of space through site-specific fictive environments. Using the Photoshop, the tools enabled her to elongate the nose, narrow the eyes and make lips look smaller. Following her previous commission for the Pop magazine wearing the Chanel’s vintage clothes from the archive, the solitary oversized female figure is located in the painterly landscape she photographed in Iceland during the eruptions of the volcano and on the isle of Capri. Within her rich oeuvre, fashion series make an important part since 1983 when fashion designer and retailer Dianne Benson commissioned her creation of advertisements for her store which appeared in several issues of Interview magazine. Other commission came from the French fashion house, Dorothee Bis whose clothes were supposed to appear in French Vogue. Her seemingly exhausted, angry, abused, scared, and psychologically disturbed model represented the complete opposite of the world of fashion glamor people got used to. Sherman has a significant collaboration with Harper’s Bazaar, Rei Kawakubo and with Comme des Garcons for which she produced the Post Card Series[3]. In 2006, she made advertisements for Marc Jacobs and four years later collaborated on a design for a piece of jewelry.   As a performative photographer, Sherman’s process of creation begins with hours of preparations, such as layering on the wigs, prosthetics, make-up and carefully chosen clothes, everything with the aim of embodying the things and expectations imposed on women by society and culture. This private introduction and creation of special identities have a very important role in the final photographic work. Through her own chameleonic myriad of characters, the artist actually questions the collective identity as it surfaces in mass media. Although insisting for decades that her characters had nothing to do with her, after her large solo show Imitation of Life, held at the Broad museum in Los Angeles in 2016, Sherman admitted that there’s still something of them in her. Including her most important pieces created from 1975 to the present, exhibition showed her Hitchcock’s inspired earliest film stills, series commissioned by Artforum and rejected for being too disturbing, the history portraits, grotesque vomit images and sex pictures and the manic clown for the end, placed on the green walls with the aim of emphasizing their psychedelic appearance. There was also her latest work – first new art pieces in five years, processing the theme of filmmaking and aging. Depicting vividly colored, dolled up former silent film divas struggling to retain their radiance and good look could be the same persons from her photographs four decades ago. Although the artist herself admits that there is no direct connection between two bodies of work, they surely represent the return to her early film inspiration. But the difference is huge. After the common preparation for the characters, the use of high resolution showed more imperfections that she has expected which was shocking, especially after the five years of creative break. Making some reparations in Photoshop, she still kept the essence that revealed the struggle of the women in the pictures[4].   Creating the photographic portraiture, deeply grounded in the present, but with an extension in art tradition that imposes on the viewer to adopt common stereotypes and cultural assumptions. Using the various characters, the artist directly confronts the viewer suggesting that unrevealed affinity for deception is maybe the only “virtue” that truly unites us. Widely recognized as the master of social critical photography, Cindy Sherman was the most important member of the Pictures Generation, a group of American artists who created during the early 1980’s, a period of rapid spreading of the mass media imagery. Starting from the unconventional space for her first solo show in 1980, Sherman was the artist whose work opened the Metro Pictures Gallery later the same year. Since then, she has been the part of numerous international events, such as SITE Santa Fe (2004), the Venice Biennale (1982, 1995), and five Whitney Biennials. Besides countless group shows, her solo exhibitions has been held in the most prominent institutions around the globe, including Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Kunsthalle Basel, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Serpentine Gallery in London, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin, among the others[5]. The traveling retrospectives have been organized several times – the biggest one from 2012, organized by the MoMA chronicled her work from the mid-1970’s and included more than 170 photographs. In 2009, Sherman was included in the seminal show The Pictures Generation, 1974-1984 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The artist is represented by Gagosian Galleries in New York, Beverly Hills, and London, and by Me Collectors Room in Berlin.  References:    ",1923
David LaChapelle,"David LaChapelle is an American photographer that worked in the fields of fashion, advertising and fine art photography throughout his career that lasted for over thirty years now. What brought him to the top of the art world were his photos of various celebrities he made in an unusual way - vivid, erotic and brimming with life. This artist is noted for his surreal, unique and often humorous style. Perhaps his strongest feature is his exceptional talent to successfully blend a unique hyper-realistic aesthetic with profound social messages and art history references. This makes his portfolio look a lot like someone's dreams: My pictures are about getting as far away from reality as possible. Dreams should be part of our everyday life.  David LaChapelle was born on March 11th, 1963, in Fairfield, Connecticut. After some difficulties surrounding his early discovered homosexuality, he attended North Carolina School of the Arts and the School of Visual Arts in New York. He first met photography at a very young age when he started making his first images during the teen years. What once was a hobby slowly started to unravel into something David might be interested in doing for his entire life. LaChapelle’s professional career began slowly during the 1980s, at the time when he was showing his artwork in various low-profile New York galleries. Mostly unknown up to that point and considered nothing more than another young photographer with loads of potential, David's photos were noticed by the legendary Andy Warhol. LaChapelle was only seventeen years of age at the time. The Pop-art icon offered LaChapelle him his first job as a photographer at Interview Magazine, Warhol's journal that was already covering many themes in contemporary photography, like the career of the aspiring Robert Mapplethorpe. Highly motivated by the chance that was given to him out of the blue, David started photographing different individuals that were chosen to appear on the pages of Interview Magazine. He soon became noticed for his characteristic use of color, highly humoristic and often erotic work. After that, the photographer's career has been going nowhere but up. He soon started shooting for a variety of top editorial publications.   Although LaChapelle was once interested in exploring themes of mortality and transcendence through fine art - mostly black and white images like the aforementioned Robert - after tasting the success with Warhol he decided to go into a full Pop art mode, so to say. Soon he became known for his hyper-realistic, distinctly saturated depictions of the VIP culture and David's name was on everyone's lips. The celebrities were literally lining up to get a chance of appearing inside David's portfolio. After he managed to establish his name as a leading one in the world of picture-taking, David LaChapelle decided it was time to branch out a bit. He began directing music videos and documentary films, even a few live theatrical events - most notably Elton John’s The Red Piano. He directed music videos for numerous singers, such as Christina Aguilera, Moby, Jennifer Lopez, Amy Winehouse, Britney Spears and No Doubt. As for his aforementioned documentary flicks, LaChapelle became a subject of much acclaim for his Krumped, an award-winner at Sundance annual festival. This film would later develop into RIZE, a movie that really put David's name on the cinematography map. No matter which medium he was working at, David was always inspired by many things - by everything from traditional art history to street culture. And furthermore, he was always successful no matter in what medium he was testing himself in.   Over the years, LaChapelle's photos have graced covers and pages of such magazines as Italian Vogue, French Vogue, Vanity Fair, GQ, Rolling Stone and i-D. He worked with many celebrities that proved to be era-defining individuals: Tupac Shakur, Madonna, Eminem, Andy Warhol, Philip Johnson, Lance Armstrong, Pamela Anderson, Lil’ Kim, Uma Thurman, Elizabeth Taylor, David Beckham, Jeff Koons, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hillary Clinton, Muhammad Ali, Britney Spears, Amanda Lepore, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga - to name just a few of them! LaChapelle has published four large books full of his photographs, including LaChapelle Land and Hotel LaChapelle, both containing vivid and bizarre portraits of star figures. It should also be noted that David LaChapelle is responsible for some of the most remarkable and memorable advertising campaigns of his generation. In 2006, LaChapelle made a tough choice of backing away from the commercial photography, all with goals of returning to his original roots that were mostly focused on fine art picture-taking. By doing so, David became a leading artist of the academic scene of while simultaneously continuing to be a crucial part of the pop side of the medium as well. Why LaChapelle made such a choice is anyone's guess, but luckily his art did not suffer for that decision as it remained intriguing and fresh. As the artist himself explained: I reintroduce my personal ideas of transfiguration, regaining paradise, and the notion of life after death.   In 1996, one article called David the Fellini of photography, a phrase that continues to be applied to him. This alone can speak enough about his importance. Over the course of his long career, David LaChapelle represents an unavoidable stop for all the people that feel as aspiring photographers or directors and wish to become more familiar with the camera. Ever since his first photograph that was a shot of his mother Helga LaChapelle holding a martini glass on a balcony, LaChapelle was obsessed with cameras and images, giving literally everything he had to the medium. This eventually led him to a status of a legendary American artist, without whom the photography would probably not be the same. From his Pop-art shots of celebrities to David's more classical pieces, Fellini of photography is truly a master at what he does and his work is a must from any fan of the medium.  The artist is represented by Me Collectors Room in Berlin and We Art Partners in Paris.  Featured Image: David LaChapelle - Photo of the artist - Photo Credits Northrup ",1924
Helmut Newton,"Although he is often considered to be one of the most notorious photographers of the 20th century, there's no denying that Helmut Newton is an extremely influential artist whose works dictated the course of fashion photography to where the genre is today. The King of Kink made his name shooting models in stunning, often provocative black-and-white photos that eventually became the author's trademark alongside his sharp tongue - for example, Helmut once stated that all photographers were voyeurs and that every single one of them negated that fact is a genuine idiot[1]. Newton was a highly prolific artist who worked for a very long time, eventually proving himself to be one of the main creative pillars behind the Vogue magazine and other publications, as well as ensuring that his work was widely imitated by all those aspiring to became as successful as he was. Although he collaborated with many colleagues and worked with a lot of assistance that ultimately became great artists in their own right, Helmut had a special artistic relationship with his wife as he was married to a fellow photographer Alice Springs[2].  Born in the year of 1920 as Helmut Neustädter, this artist grew up as a German Jew and had a rather privileged childhood in Berlin due to his family's wealth[3]. A son of the factory owner, Helmut received his first camera at the age of 12 and was rarely caught without it in his hands ever since, often neglecting his studies in school in order to pursue photography. It is reputed that Newton first became fascinated with the female nude as a photographic subject as a teenager while working as an apprentice to a certain theater photographer Yva in Berlin. He fled increasing Nazi oppression in Germany in 1938, shortly after a massive, coordinated attack on Jews known as Kristallnacht (The Night of Broken Glass).  After that night, young Helmut went to Singapore while his parents sailed to South America. He worked in Singapore and Australia during World War II, serving in the Australian army for several years. When the war ended, the photographer became an Australian citizen and changed his name to Newton in the year of 1946. He was finally able to pursue an artistic career in photography as the events of World War II prevented him from doing anything long term in that regard. Newton later opened up a photography studio and moved to Europe in the 1950s, seeking better circumstances for his art.    From the moment he arrived at the Old Continent, Helmut realized that the decision to move here was a great one. He was a young, wealthy artist whose ambition was only rivaled with an inspiring story of how he survived and fought through the war that was still very much echoing throughout Europe. In order to be as close to the avant-garde circles as possible, Newton moved to the City of Light. There, it took him no time to began working for French Vogue and other publications during the 1950s and 1960s as his reputation grew, traveling frequently throughout the world on assignments. He was hired by Australian Vogue in the 1950s, by British Vogue in 1957 and by French Vogue in 1961. Throughout the years, Newton contributed to magazines such as Playboy, Queen, Nova, Marie-Claire, Elle and the American, Italian, and German editions of Vogue. All in all, the name of Helmut Newton became a fashion sensation and was on everyone's lips, topping the wishing lists of many famous companies that were pursuing his services[4].  Helmut soon became renowned for his ability to visually provoke with style as his nudes were managing to be simultaneously elegant and highly erotic. He was also able to insert narratives into his pieces although the themes in which he dabbled required nothing of the sort - Newton was doing this very subtly and boldly, insisting that his artworks were more than simple fashion photos. And they were. Unfortunately, a heart attack in the year of 1970 reduced Newton's output quite a bit, but his profile continued to increase, especially with his 1980 Big Nudes series, which marked the pinnacle of his erotic-urban style, underpinned with excellent technical skills. Newton shot a number of pictorials for Playboy[5] that are till deemed as the magazine's greatest, including the images of Nastassja Kinski and Kristine DeBell.   Besides the fashion pieces, Newton also worked in portraiture[6] and more fantastical studies in his free time. However, his technique was always the focal point, always the core of the photo. He was known for the dramatic lighting and the unconventional poses of his models in his photographs. Newton’s work has often been characterized as obsessive and subversive, incorporating themes of sadomasochism, prostitution, violence and a persistently-overt sexuality into the narratives of his images. Stylistically, it can be said that his black-and-white pictures combine the impression of 1930s noir photojournalism with aspects of New Wave movies, all underlined by a strong erotic note. Over the course of years, his work centered mainly on fashion, nudes and portraits, with the three categories often mixing with each other. He increasingly focused more on these images rather than fashion photography in the 1980s, emphasizing the aggressive and provocative in his works.  It should be noted that Newton is a recipient of the Best Photography Award from the Art Directors Club in Tokyo, Japan in 1977, an award recipient of the American Institute of Graphic Arts Award and in 1978 he received an award for the Gold Medal from the Art Directors Club in Germany. Among other honors, Newton received the German Kodak Award for Photographic Books, a Life Legend Award from Life magazine and an award from the American Institute of Graphic Arts for his photographs. Helmut Newton continued to travel later in life, dividing his time between his homes in Monte Carlo and Los Angeles. Just as the case was way back when he was a teenager, he never dropped the camera from his hands[7]. Shortly before his death, the artist had established the Helmut Newton Foundation in Berlin and also donated around one thousand of his works to his native city. He died in the year of 2004 in a car crash in Los Angeles, at the age of 84.  Although he was a part of a very superficial artistic community, Helmut Newton was renowned for his ability and desire to insert unexpected contexts into his work. Newton is also credited with imbuing fashion photography with narrative depth that only further enhanced his stylized, dreamlike scenes. His work was and still is renowned for an entire assembly line of bold creative decisions that ultimately paid off extremely well for this author. Newton's radiant black-and-white images of elegant, powerful and sensual women, shot in controversial scenarios, daring lighting and striking compositions remain as some of the greatest photographies ever taken. Now, more than a decade after his death, the artist's reputation hasn't faded at all as the rather questionable argument against his lasting influence on high-fashion photography ended a long time ago. The iconic Helmut Newton continues to live on through his immortal images of models wearing little but high heels and cold glares - images that even now have the power to shock and amaze.

Mark Ryden,"A master of subtle contradictions and general cuteness, Mark Ryden is an American painter and a key individual of the Lowbrow art movement, more commonly known as Pop Surrealism. Alongside his talented wife Marion Peck who is also an important element of the Pop Surrealism art movement, the duo is one of the most important art couples in Portland, OR. Ryden's mixes of classicistic and modern pop elements have reached an iconic status and his impact on the concepts of Lowbrow art is so impressive that Mark actually garners the nickname of The godfather of Pop surrealism!  Mark Ryden was born in Medford, Oregon, on the January 20th of the year 1963. However, the artist was raised in Southern California after his parents Barbara and Keith Ryden decided to move to sunnier lands. Mark had two sisters and two brothers, with one growing up into a fellow artist named Keyth Ryden (who now works under the name of KRK). His father made a living in an interesting way - by painting, restoring and customizing vehicles. Inspired by Keith's freedom to express himself while working, Mark wanted to pursue similar opportunities. Keeping that in mind, Ryden graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 1987. Right after he wrapped up the college days and left them behind him, Mark started working as a commercial artist available for hire. During that time, most of his profits came from the music industry as he used to design the album covers for numerous bands and singers - including Michael Jackson's Dangerous, the 4 Non Blondes' Bigger, Better, Faster, More!, The Red Hot Chili Peppers' One Hot Minute and Aerosmith's Love in an Elevator. He found another source of income in designing book covers. Among his most notable clients, Ryden created covers for Stephen King's novels Desperation and The Regulators. Mark made a living as a marketable artist until his work was taken up by Robert Williams, a former member of the Zap Comix collective, who in 1994 put Ryden's reproductions on the cover of Juxtapoz, a magazine devoted to lowbrow art.   From the year of 1994 and the cooperation with Robert Williams, Ryden devoted all his efforts to the development of the Pop Surrealism, a movement that was really booming at the time. Mark's solo debut show entitled The Meat Show was in Pasadena, California in 1998. In this display, the motif of meat was a reoccurring theme in his work, taking central stage in most paintings. Ryden desired to emphasize the disconnect in our contemporary culture between meat we serve as food and the living, breathing creatures it comes from. This contradiction brought much attention to the exhibition, as well as the peculiar style Ryden applied to his paintings. Years that followed after that were a real cornerstone both for Ryden's career and his style which he managed to establish. Ryden became popular for blending themes of pop culture with techniques reminiscent of the old masters - he developed a unique style that blurs the traditional boundaries between high and low art. For those reasons, Pop Surrealism is also known as Lowbrow art, an ironic name that truly explains the movement's identity. Ryden would paint fairy tale creatures, historical figures and pop cultural icons in same compositions - such concepts were genius at the time and really brought on a revolution amongst the art scene and the way people perceive art. Ryden's paintings in oil are not only clever mixes of what is considered to be traditional and not, they are also incredibly beautiful to behold. However, a subtle disquiet always inhabits his paintings - the work is achingly pretty as it hints at darker psychic stuff beneath the surface that is shown to us. His visual vocabulary ranges from cryptic to cute, treading a fine line between what Mark himself likes to call nostalgic cliché and disturbing archetype.   As was clued earlier, Mark Ryden's aesthetic is generated from subtle combinations of many sources, from Ingres, David and other French classicists to Little Golden Books, a popular series of inexpensive, well-illustrated, high-quality children's books. One of the rare rules Mark keeps to when drawing inspiration it that anything he uses must evoke mystery on some level - with that in mind, Ryden chooses to incorporate elements such as old toys, anatomical models, stuffed animals, skeletons and religious ephemera. Ten years after Ryden became The godfather of pop surrealism, he had already established an amazing personal mythology and symbolism, as well as an incredible dedication to small details and hidden messages. Ten years after Ryden became The godfather of pop surrealism, he had already established an amazing personal mythology and symbolism, as well as an incredible dedication to small details and hidden messages. In his more mature work, Ryden explored the modern human experience of nature - underlined by the The Tree Show exhibition. Some people look at these massive trees and feel a sort of spiritual awe looking at them, and then other people just want to cut them up and sell them, they only see a commodity, Mark explained. Another cornerstone and a midcareer retrospective came during the year of 2004, in a form of an exhibition titled Wondertoonel (a reference to a cabinet of curiosities or Wunderkammer) co-organized by the Frye Museum in Seattle and the Pasadena Museum of California Art. It was the best-attended exhibition since the Frye Art Museum opened in 1952 and also broke attendance records in Pasadena, both information indicating the importance and popularity of Mark Ryden. In 2009, Ryden's exhibition The Snow Yak Show revealed more serene compositions and suggestive of solitude, peacefulness and introspection unlike anything Mark showed before. In 2010, The Gay 90’s: Old Tyme Art Show seen Ryden find a central theme that referenced the idealism and sentimentalism of the 1890s while addressing the role of kitsch and nostalgia in our current culture. Here Mark explored the line between attraction and repulsion to kitsch, an important segment of the Pop Surrealism movement. An album titled The Gay Nineties Old Tyme Music: Daisy Bell from the year of 2010 was similarly called but was not connected to the 2010 show. It featured artists such as Katy Perry, Stan Ridgway of Wall Of Voodoo, Danny Elfman, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, Nick Cave, Kirk Hammett of Metallica and Everlast, bringing in much critical acclaim.   To truly understand Pop Surrealism, one must experience the art of Mark Ryden. A bold statement, yes, but also a true one. Since Mark's concepts and style have dragged a good number of followers in his wake, if you desire to analyze the works of the Lowbrow, literally every road will somehow take you to Ryden's doorstep. Through his macabre motifs like meat grinders and disembodied presidents with eye-pleasing ingénues and seductive landscapes, Mark Ryder and his work serve as a true example of artistic independence and an inspiration for all the aspiring artist who wish to create something new and completely their own. The artist is represented by Kohn Gallery in Los Angeles, Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York and Tomio Koyama Gallery in Tokyo.

Joram Roukes,"Joram Roukes is a Dutch fine artist, best known for his large oil paintings where he is blending various stylistic elements and references to sub cultural group as well as popular culture, while insisting on comprehensive and colorful compositions. His works have been shown throughout Europe with shows in Copenhagen and London.  Roukes was born in Lelystad, the Netherlands.  He graduated from the Academy of fine arts Minerva (BFA) in painting and education in 2006. One of the turning points in Roukes’ art was award that he received in 2008 ‘Start Stipendium’ by Netherlands Foundation for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture. This helped him to pay for an artist residency in Brooklyn, New York where he worked for 4 months, initiating his current line and body of work.  When asked about his strengths and weaknesses and how the college did influenced him, Joram states: “My strength as well as my weakness I think is being able to paint well. As it is tempting to opt for this medium anytime I’m creating something, even when sometimes a different medium or technique or discipline may be more suitable to work out ideas. This was the case during my education as well as I was practicing graffiti prior to that. Doing graffiti, you kind of teach yourself aesthetic ways that are awfully difficult to get rid of. I struggled with this at first because I thought I didn’t need to let go of this even though teachers wanted me to be more of a ‘tabula rasa’. It took a while for me to realize it is very valuable to open up and experiment.” Roukes’s works are characterized by poppy colors and humor at first glance, only to be rediscovered as something adventurous, bleak and uncanny, underneath the surface. His large oil paintings are the reflections of everyday life situations, observed, filtered and reassembled in combination of materials, usually a kind of build-ups or collages of inner-city figures and characters.   Joram Roukes lived in a small Dutch town of Groningen before moving to US. The town itself isn’t the most inspiring of all places, he said, but his work often refers to the kind of banal excesses of modern society, and that is, indeed, well present in our small country and community.  His coming to New York put him right in the middle of excessive society. The result of these social and cultural amplitudes he experienced is a fruitful combination of criticizing both western and non-western societies, coming to the conclusion that the chosen mainstream lifestyle isn’t generally in anyone’s best interest.  Visually judging upon society’s flaws or imperfections seems obviously redundant, so he tends to confuse, leaving most of the story unfinished. “There hasn’t been a specific incident or experience that influenced me in that regard. It’s more of a gradual process. I observe and filter the world around me and give everyday life a fair chance to inspire me”, Roukes confesses.   Graffiti-art had (and still has) a big impact on Joram Roukes’ work - in terms of the aesthetics but also in the way of looking at the world. As he says, it gave him a sharp eye for the ‘dirty edges’ of society and ability to see beauty in decay. Animals play a very important role in Roukes’ art, as he paints mostly animal heads on his human figures to enable association. That is because animal heads, according to artist, can evoke association with a certain behavior and attitude he wishes to present, much more than a human face can do. Simply, a human face doesn’t work in the same way. That is why he never paints any portraits. “Painting a human would make the painting be about this particular person, and that is not what I’m aiming for. It will become too recognizable as ‘someone’ instead of ‘something’”  With an airy atmosphere and dream-like surrealist landscapes, Roukes’ paintings create multiple layers of content, featuring characters placed in situations ranging from western folkloric festivities to common customs and behavior in a context of both reality and dreams. Joram Roukes admits that he looks up mostly to contemporary artists. Neo Rauch’s work has been more an inspiration than a simple influence. Same goes for Glenn Brown whom he calls “incredible”. Jeremy Geddes is also in that company, together with David Lynch and his films.   In 2013, Rouke’s show at StolenSpace Gallery: Les bons Sauvages, presented a work that he created as a result of his own personal interest to the subject of folklore and tradition; placing human and animal figures in situations ranging from western folkloric festivities to common customs, showing a behavior in a context or environment touching both dream and reality.   In 2014, a gallery Thinkspace in Los Angeles presented Joram Roukes’ exhibition Paramnesia. The show was named after a phenomenon when the perception of realities, either imagined or observed, is inextricably bound; a person actually confuses reality and fantasy (like in the cases of déjà vu). Through a subjective process of recall, memory becomes a complex mirage of juxtapositions and imaginative distortions – the real is subsumed by the imaginary, making the two virtually indistinguishable. The artist suggested that contemporary consciousness is subject to the motives of its adopted imaginaries, and reality; and he did it by combining fragments of the real with the limitless associations of dream and fantasy – morphing the one into the other. Roukes moved freely between precise, anatomically-correct figure painting and a messy expressionism.  In 2015, Roukes participated in Masters Projects, Brooklyn where he held an exhibition together with an American artist Charles Wilkin. The two artists were united in this occasion by the dark nature of their surreal subjects, as well as their intuitive juxtapositions of photographic imagery and abstracted forms.  For this duo shoe, each artist used appropriated images as ‘readymades’ within their unique stream-of-consciousness styles; processing the themes concerning the nature of interpretation and the ways in which images embody cultural memory.  One of Joram Roukes’ 2015 project was an exhibition The Great Beyond at StolenSpace Gallery in London. This show presented a new body of work that anatomized subjects of exploration and escapism by drawing from his personal nomadic experiences, exploring the wider sense of this subject.

Pakpoom Silaphan,"Pakpoom Silaphan is a Thai artist who explores the phenomena surrounding a ""West­Obsessed"" world.  Influenced by Pop Art of the 20th century, Silaphan re­works found objects to create his own fresh interpretation of Pop Art. Silaphanʼs practice examines notions of globalisation, mass consumerism and the universal reach of cultural icons across the world. Silaphan primarily uses found-objects such as old metal advertising signs collected during his years living in Thailand, as his canvas. Also using vintage wooden Pepsi and Coca-Cola crates, reminiscent of Warholʼs Brillo Box installations; Silaphan re-works these objects to create a fresh interpretation of Pop Art and opens a discourse on the effects of advertising and mass consumption. The infiltration of western imagery and ideology had a profound influence on Silaphanʼs understanding of the West and on his artistic practice. Using his favoured artistic icons, such as Warhol, Dali and Frida Khalo, he collages and paints over these branded advertising signs and crates, implying the artistsʼ identity as a recognised global brand itself. Silaphan creates an engaging dialogue between the relationship between East and West, and the universal language of signs and symbols that is accessible to all and has been imprinted on to the universal collective consciousness. Pakpoom Silaphan was born in Bangkok in 1972 and lived in Thailand all throughout his youth. After receiving his BFA at Silapakorn University in Bangkok in 1995, Silaphan moved to London to study printmaking at Camberwell College of Art in 2001 and received a Masters in Fine Art from Chelsea College of Art and Design in 2002. Silaphan still resides in London today, where he continues to practice his art and printmaking. Silaphan has exhibited work in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Delhi, and has been featured in many notable publications as well. In 2012 he was featured in “For Which It Stands: Americana in Contemporary Art” by Carla Sakamoto, published by Farameh Media. In 2011, Emma Love of The Independent described Silaphan’s work as “a sign of the times” and in 2013 “the Pop artist of these times.” Silaphan has been featured twice in the Financial Times, Elle Magazine, and more. Pakpoom Silaphan currently lives and works in London, UK.",1928
Andreas Gursky,"The collective bodies or constellations of objects seem to obsess Andrea Gursky pretty much so it is no wonder that those motifs became his trademark. The opaque landscapes on his photographs are at the same time alluring and freighting; those images are suggesting the states of present times, but they do possess the prophetic view on the world after tomorrow. Whether populated by humans or completely emptied, the depicted spaces do reflect the ongoing political and social turbulences.  Andreas Gursky was born in 1955 in Leipzig. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to West Germany. He studied at Folkwangschule in Essen, West Germany’s leading establishment for professional photographers. His early, unadorned compositions are heavily influenced by his years at Folkwang, where the curriculum was largely focused on the straight-shot techniques of photojournalism. Nevertheless, from 1981-1987 Gursky extended his studies at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Out there the artist was under the great influences of his teachers, great conceptual photographic duo Hilla and Bernd Becher, known for their distinctive method of systematically mapping industrial machinery and architecture.   The lessons from the Becher’s straightened his approach and Gursky started releasing a similarly methodical approach in his own large-scale photography. The other notable influence came from the British landscape photographer John Davies, whose highly detailed high vantage point images had a strong effect on the street level photographs. The curiosity is that before the 1990s the artist did not digitally manipulate his images, but then technological improvement provided him with an option of enhancing the images in regards to size and quality.   Despite the digitalization, the artist still shoots on a large-format film camera. The images are scanned and then painstakingly manipulated, often assembled from several photographs at once. One of the main characteristics is the perspective which is in many of Gursky’s photographs drawn from an elevated vantage point. This peculiar position is apparently part of the concept since it seems that by encompassing both center and periphery, Andreas Gursky wishes to undermine the domains of globalization.   Together with Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer, Thomas Struth and Axel Hütte, the artist belongs to infamous Düsseldorf School. All of these artists studied at the Kunstakademie and developed authentic oeuvres based on the purified and conceptual aesthetic. With several colleagues from the school, Gursky shares a studio in Düsseldorf. A former electricity station was transformed into an artists studio and living quarters in 2001, by architects Herzog & de Meuron, who built Tate Modern. In 2010-11, the architects worked again on the building, designing a gallery in the basement.   Although Andreas Gursky is enchanted with his grand subjects, he also is careful in regards to reflecting the dispassionate attitude that permeates his work. The artist often uses cranes and even helicopters and pursues various legislation permissions in order to shoot peculiar sights or people regardless of complex negotiations. On famous Bahrain racetrack, the artist had to shoot patiently for two hours from different viewpoints before bringing them together to form a single composition. He is known for badgering the organizers for a consistently higher viewpoint so that he could capture the terrifying scale and precision of this vast propagandist event, which was the case while shooting in North Korea.   The fascination with the daily and spontaneous choreographed movements of people in public space has often been represented on his works from the 90’s. For example, in 1992 Gursky made a shot at Charles de Gaulle depicting hurriedly people moving through the airport building. In 1995 Andreas Gursky's shoot the atmosphere of rave party during the Dance Valley festival. The ecstatic image depicts the entranced mass looking towards a DJ in smoke and lights. Interestingly, the artist is the great fan of electronic music so there are a couple of series dedicated to rave culture.   As it was already mentioned, Andreas Gursky is a hooked on representing globalization. His famous photograph 99 Cent from 1999 was taken at a 99 Cents Only store on Sunset Boulevard and its interior is depicted as a stretched horizontal composition of parallel shelves fulfilled with various goods. Whether the landfills, stock exchanges or minimal shop displays in Prada, are displayed, his images are the visual chronicle of the global capitalist machine. The artist points out that he is not interested in undermining political statement, rather he perceives his works as notes which help him to better understand the mechanism of the contemporary world.   Over the years Andreas Gursky has exhibited his work in various solo and group exhibitions, among which the Venice Biennale (1990 and 2004), and the Biennale of Sydney (1996 and 2000) are the most important ones. A large number of notable institutions are holding his works from like Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London, as well as private collections. The artist is a professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and is one of the best selling photographers in the world. Besides the fame and both academic, purely artistic and commercial success, Andreas Gursky continues to produce works in a similar manner by depicting scenes occurring in recognizable urban spaces, ranging from department stores and hotels to the German Parliament and the Chicago Board of Trade.

Lucio Fontana,"We have seen an exponential amount of progress and change occurring in many fields in recent history; this goes for art as well, as there have been a number of new directions, styles, and methods created in the 20th century, with some of the artists going down in history. One of them that can be attributed as the herald of change is the Italian artist Lucio Fontana whose work foreshadowed Environment art and performance art that are omnipresent in contemporary surroundings. Known as a founder of Spatialism and for his ties to Arte Povera, Fontana remains one of the monumental figures in the time of great artists.  The life of Lucio Fontana started out in Argentina where his father Luigi, who was a sculptor, and mother Lucia Bottino, a theater actress, had lived. Although they were both of Italian origin, Lucio was born in the province of Santa Fe, and the mixture of both Argentinean and Italian surroundings will play a role later in his life. As soon as he reached the age necessary for schooling, he was sent to Italy for education where he remained until his college days. Attending the master-builders school at the Carlo Cattaneo Institute in Milan, Fontana actively practiced art in his father’s studio while living with his uncle. He would later complete his studies and receive the diploma of a building surveyor, but not before enrolling in the First World War.  Although he was a promising young artist and a scholar, Fontana decided to volunteer as a soldier for the First World War in 1916, interrupting his studies. Intelligent and talented as he was, he reached the rank of a second lieutenant in the infantry regiment during his days as a soldier even though his background never included military training. His injury during the war forced him to return to Milan, and luckily, he was able to continue and finish his studies and of course, his artistic practice. For his contribution in the war and service to the country, he received a silver campaign medal in 1918.  The years following the return of Fontana from the battlefield were marked by exploring his inner artist. This exploration took place both in Italy and Argentina, and it is possible that exactly because of his varying heritage and time spent on both continents his practice took such an innovative and explorative shape. Returning to Argentina in 1921, Fontana had worked in his father’s studio producing graveyard sculptures, all the while experimenting and researching new ways and forms of the style. After several successful years of such practice, he enrolled in the sculpture course at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts and by presenting his El Auriga (The Charioteer), he received his diploma. His investigative nature kept him going even after the college days. During the 1930s, his sculptures took on human-like figures, deprived of their accustomed form and reduced to geometrized shapes, much like in his 1930 Uomo Nero (Black Man). Investigations of form led Fontana to produce abstract sculptures in ceramics and even in colored mosaics at the beginning of the 1940s. This culminated in his first piece of work of environmental art, the Frieze Volo Di Vittorie, standing for Flight of Victories.   It was in the year of 1946 that the term Spatial Concept first appeared as a part of titles of a group of drawings done by Fontana. Following his return to Italy after teaching as a professor at the Esquela de Artes Plasticas in Argentina, he supported, along with other philosophers and writers, the first manifesto of Spatialism, as he had formulated various theories about the subject beforehand. What it basically consists of is expanding the artistic practice to more than just the narrative by focusing on the space around the canvas as well, using it in addition to other technologies like neon lighting and television to give the work another dimension. Some of Fontana’s first representatives of these theories were his slashing series that was comprised of two different types of portrayals of dimensionality: via holes (the Buchi category) and slashes (the Tagli). These punctures on the surface of the painting would reveal the area behind it often lined with black gauze, giving the piece a certain depth as the blackness of the material seeps out of the holes. Emphasizing the space behind the canvas, he switched to monochrome-like surfaces around 1958 that would completely divert the attention of the viewer towards the slashes.   The way he would create his work after the Second World War through the rest of his career was largely influenced by the spatial concept. Working both with sculpture and paintings, the emphasis was often on the dimensionality of it portrayed through various gashes. As final years of his prolific career, the 1960s were marked by thick layers of oil paint punctured with holes, culminating in the strict use of single colors for his canvases in the Ellipses series, as well as sculptural work inspired by New York that consisted of metal plates punctured by the artist. Fontana also produced a number of famous oval paintings between 1963 and 1964 in a cycle titled The End of God, one of which (Concetto spaziale, la fine di dio) fetched over $29 million in 2015 at an auction. In these late years, he would also use machines to perforate the wooden panels of his paintings, keeping in line with new technical developments.   Lucio Fontana’s oeuvre is more than just visually alluring and thought-provoking, it brought about a movement that changed the perspective on art pieces. Creative in his explorative practice, he was able to invent something new on a philosophical level that transcends to art in a time of such legendary artists, making him one of the greats of the era. With so many renowned collections holding his work and many awards and exhibitions to his name, it remains written down in the history of art. The artist is represented by We Art Partners. ",1930
Remi Rough,"Remi Rough is a British artist, graffiti writer, designer, art director, curator, whose recent works could be described as “painting visual haikus”. South London born and bred, Remi has been breaking boundaries with the aid of a spray can and a paintbrush for over 28 years. Transcending the traditional and somewhat idealised vision of a graffiti writer, he is passionate and unforgiving in his creative progression. He moved from the streets to the galleries with his debut art show in 1989 and has since gone on to exhibit in London, Paris, Perth, Tokyo, Santander, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, Vancouver, Hong Kong, Berlin, Ibiza and more cities dotted around the globe. However, he still keeps his finger in the street art pie, taking part in New York’s Underbelly Project in 2010. As Arrested Motion wrote: “Remi is that rare breed of artist whose work you can equally enjoy in an outdoor setting and also in a gallery/home without it feeling awkward and out of context.” His work has also appeared in the books; Graffiti World, Abstract Graffiti and Untitled III and was featured in the award winning ‘Ghost Village Project’. Remi was invited to speak on the underground history of UK graffiti in front of a sell-out auditorium at the Tate Modern, as part of its Street Art exhibition in 2008 and in 2009 he published his first book “Lost Colours and Alibis”.",1931
Martin Parr,"Being the chronicler of our times is not an easy task at all, yet Martin Parr curiously perceives that role as a matter of perfect choice. During his several decades-long career, the artist has primarily focused on depicting different social classes; especially the population of rural England has been represented in several series. With vigor and wit, Parr constructed strong satirical shots and his photographs are not only documents of past times and changing contexts, rather they are well conducted anthropological studies which semantically provide much more than just a visual impression.   Martin Parr was born in Epsom, Surrey, UK, in 1952. From the early age, he showed tremendous interest in the medium of photography and was largely encouraged by his grandfather George Parr, who was an amateur photographer and member of the Royal Photographic Society. The artist studied photography at Manchester Polytechnic, from 1970 to 1973, and has developed an international reputation for his innovative imagery, his oblique approach to social documentary, and his input to photographic culture within the UK and abroad.   Simultaneously with his artistic practice, Martin Parr has been a successful lecturer and curator. From 2004 to 2012 he was Professor of Photography at The University of Wales Newport campus, and in 2013 was appointed visiting Professor of Photography at the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland. In 2008 Martin Parr was the guest curator at New York Photo Festival, while in 2010 the artist curated the Brighton Photo Biennial in October. One of the last projects titled Strange and Familiar was curated by Parr in 2016 at the Barbican. The show examines how international photographers from 1930s onward have photographed in the UK.   The artist joined famous Magnum Photos as an associate member in 1988. Several years later, Parr applies for membership, yet Philip Jones Griffiths tries to influence other members not to include him in the organization. Nevertheless, Parr achieved the necessary two-thirds majority by one vote. Interestingly, Magnum membership helped him not only in further development of photojournalist style, but enabled him to work on editorial photography for Paul Smith, Louis Vuitton, and other clients. In 2014 Parr was voted in as president of Magnum Photos International.   The lens of Martin Parr are always on a search for strange, grotesque and twisted motifs. The subjects or more precisely the situations which he captures are accentuated with vivid colors and the perspectives. By focusing mostly on leisure, consumption, and communication, the artist critically articulates human activity, so from this time distance, it can be even said that his most common topics are consumerism, babbitry, and globalization. Whether the images depict modern life in provincial England or are made during his travels, they are humorous, seductive, and provide a new insight in how interaction is affected by cultural peculiarities and context.   The first mature work Parr did was realized in West Yorkshire, where he spent five years photographing rural life in the area, focusing on the Methodist (and some Baptist) non-conformist chapels, a focal point for isolated farming communities that in the early 1970s were closing down. At the beginning of 80’s, he photographed working-class people at the seaside in nearby New Brighton, while during 1987 and 1988 he completed his next major project, on the middle class, who were at that time becoming increasingly affluent under Thatcherism. With a project, Small World (1987–1994) Parr dealt with mass tourism and with Common Sense (1995–1999) he was focused on global consumerism.    Besides taking photography to a higher level by conjoining it with different genres, such as fashion and advertising, Martin Parr has developed a particular interest in film-making, From 1990–92 he has collaborated with Nick Barker, during a shooting of Barker's film Signs of the Times. A couple of years later, the artist began producing his own television documentaries with Mosaic Film. He was the cameraman on the film It's Nice Up North (2006), while in 2014 Parr created Turkey and Tinsel, a 60 minute deadpan and often hilarious observational video documentary about faux Christmas in small town England.    Parrworld opened at Haus de Kunst, Munich, in 2008. The show exhibited Parr’s own collection of objects, more than 1,000 examples of photo books from the 19th century through to the present day, postcards, photography prints by both British and International photographers, and a new project from Parr entitled Luxury. The items from his collections have been used as the basis for publications and exhibitions. Interestingly, since the 1970s, Parr has collected and publicized the postcards made between the 1950s and 1970s by John Hinde and his team of photographers. The exhibition toured Europe for the following 2 years.   Apparently, throughout the years, the career of Martin Parr has developed in different directions but he has kept the ability to carefully note our age. Therefore, it is no wonder the artist has been awarded a number of honors such as the Erich Salomon Prize in 2006 or Baume et Mercier award in recognition of his professional career and contributions to contemporary photography at PhotoEspana in 2008. Works in various collections, over 90 books of his own work published, vast personal collection, notable academic career make the artist person of outstanding domains. The photographs of Martin Parr offer us sensitizes our subconscious, they are memorable and are the pure reflection of all the aspects of our daily existence.  ",1932
Bambi,"Taking on the name of the legendary white-tailed deer from Disney's workshop, Bambi is the pseudonym of a female contemporary British street artist who has been painting all over the streets of North London's suburb of Islington for years now. This stencil painter has acquired quite a reputation over the years, simultaneously down to her connection with the famed Banksy and the ability to speak her mind freely and uncompromisingly despite any potential consequences. Even though her true identity is still a mystery, Bambi has given us little information regarding her personal life - among other things, we know she took a long time to decide if she will pursue a career of a pop singer or street artist. Since we do not know who she exactly is, we can not be sure if Bambi has a good voice, but urban painting seems to have worked out just fine.  It's always tempting to attempt and find out as much as you are able about someone that desperately desires to stay anonymous, but if you dare to investigate Bambi’s private life you will surely find yourself in a giant cloud of legends and rumors that can not be either confirmed nor disproven. Unfortunately for those that are curious, all that we know about this street artist has been handed to us by Bambi herself and that, actually, is not much. What has been revealed so far is that she is a female, was born around the year of 1982 and that the Bambi tag name is actually a compressed version of the childhood nickname her father had for her, Bambino (meaning a small child or kid in Italian). Another fact that was admitted by the artist herself is that Bambi had a prominent career in the music business as a singer before she traded her voice for a can of spraypaint. After that info hit the streets, there’ve been numerous reports linking Bambi cloaked identity with the likes of Paloma Faith or Geri Halliwell, singers that both had their five minutes of fame but later on disappeared from the map of stardom. Some journalists have even went as far as saying Bambi is actually Adele or Victoria Beckham, which, in all honesty, makes little to no sense. When you realize just how little is known about her, it becomes obvious that Bambi goes by the old-school rules of street art making as she allows her work to come way ahead of her in importance and to do the actual talking for her - which we can’t help but admire. Nevertheless, what also must be handed to Bambi is the impressive expertise of handling the media storm and the perseverance in not responding to numerous rumors that seem to be appearing literally every single day. This cloud of interest circling around her name is doing her a great deal of favor as it makes for fine publicity.  It has often been said that Bambi’s true identity is known only by a handful of people, namely her manager, her mother and the legendary Banksy himself - this artist with a cult status had a massive role in Bambi’s development and street expression. Another inspiration to her is the aforementioned mother who herself is also a successful artist (Bambi’s father was a jazz musician in his time who also had a huge influence on his daughter and not only by giving her a pseudonym). As you may expect, she goes through a lot of trouble in order to conceal her true identity - she works at dawn, in white overalls, dust mask and goggles. As was mentioned above, Bambi has been using North London suburb of Islington as a canvas for years, slowly progressing her expression and mastering the skills required to be an efficient street artist. She started to be noticed when her masterful stenciling and spray-painting began appearing in highly visible and public locations where virtually a limitless number of viewers were able to see her creations first hand. She created an additional attention storm by depicting both everyday people and celebrities such as Prince William and Kate Middleton, Queen Elizabeth II and Amy Winehouse. This way, Bambi was able to devise pieces that are both capable of communicating with viewers about aspects they understand completely and simultaneously allow them to identify themselves with the personas painted on London public surfaces. Besides the aforementioned celebrities, Bambi has been depicting many other icons of modern times, including soccer superstar David Beckham, Holywood’s most famed couple of Jolie and Pitt, pop stars such as Rihanna and Adele, as well as the secret agent James Bond (it is actually said that Bambi is a huge fan of everything Bondy and that she even drives Aston Martin in order to pay tribute to 007). Of course, things have not always been as fantastic for Bambi as is the case today. Believe it or not, she too once was unknown and overlooked, up until the year of 2011 when she painted a portrait of Amy Winehouse on the wall of a north London supermarket - this was the D-Day of Bambi’s career and from then on, she has been going nowhere but up. Due to the obvious intimacy of the Amy piece, many have agreed that Bambi and the late Winehouse were friends before the singer met her tragic end.   Trying to somehow get a sure grip on the concepts of Bambi’s art is a feat easier said than done, despite the fact her work frequently appears to be simple in nature. The best explanation to her portfolio is that Bambi relies on her art to be a relatively neutral and objective reflection of current events - she employs representational imagery to offer social commentary and address political concerns. Among the most frequently used themes one may find in Bambi’s work, what really stands out are the topics of feminism, popular and street culture - despite that, her creative output has been frequently described as gritty and masculine in its appearance. It’s impressive how Bambi is able to find a fine line between rough exterior and female identity with strong allusions to patriarchal culture. Her artwork has often been compared to the pieces authored by Banksy, which is only natural when you consider the two are obviously friends since he knows Bambi’s identity. There is a clear difference between them, however, as the male counterpart concentrates his efforts to commentary on war, globalization, child poverty and shows other social issues - Bambi’s portfolio si simply not as politicized and it reveals less dramatic compositions. The street due has a deep relationship as Banksy is obviously Bambi’s stylistic mentor, which is far from a bad combination for her as he is considered by many to be the godfather of graffiti. As you may well imagine, juggling such complicated ideas and finding perfect balances as Bambi does demands a high intelligence and knowledgeable control over her subjects - it has often been suggested that Bambi graduated from the Saint Martin’s College in London as this institution would be more than capable of giving the young artist all of the creative sparks she ever needed. With such interesting and intriguing concepts, it’s no wonder Bambi has been exhibiting her work on various shows, even some that had a fine art context. Her first fine art exhibition was at the Walton Fine Arts Gallery in London in 2012 and she had many more after that.   As is often the case, the road to success was not paved in roses and it took some doing and patience, but over time, Bambi has been accepted as a leading artist in her field. Arguably the highlight of her career in that department was the moment Bambi was commissioned by model Kate Moss to paint a personal street art portrait of her, very similar to Andy Warhol’s classic piece Marilyn. Later on, Bambi’s pieces have found their way into prestigious collections of celebrated curators such as Rihanna, Robbie Williams and Take That’s Mark Owen, as well as the already mentioned Brad Pitt and Adele. Bambi’s work has often been credited with another accomplishment, one far less glamorous - during the year of 2010, some of her pieces in Primrose Hill were brutally vandalized. This started the long-running London debate over the preservation of street art and it ultimately resulted in Islington Councillors suggesting a committee be authorized with tasks taking care of street art’s future protection. This way, Bambi has indirectly created a safe heaven for all the new street artists in London as the look on their urban pieces has forever been changed for the better. From that point on, Bambi has been celebrated by fellow street painters and the media attention over the 2010 legal battles made sure she is on everyone’s lips, making her one of the most popular urban artists not only in the United Kingdom but in the entire world. She was even handpicked to commemorate the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton with the satirical slogan A Bit Like Marmite across their chests - how many stencil painters of the streets can say they have such an accomplishment in their curriculum vitae? It should also be noted that Bambi paints indoor pieces as well and that they are, at the very least, as impressive as the outdoors murals.  As if her urban art was not impressive enough on her own, Bambi has managed to do what almost no other street painter ever did - she established herself in elite circles where contemporary art commands a high market price. That alone makes Bambi the designated American dream of street art, a level of popularity and love that should serve as a guiding star of all urban painters. And all the while aspiring graffiti and stencil artists look up at her, Bambi continues to paint and amaze us on both sides of the Atlantic, regularly bringing us incredible pieces stolen straight out of a bottomless well of her ideas. It will be interesting to see where her expressive methods will lead her as Bambi is (presumably) still quite young and there are many more artistic years ahead of her - will she continue to paint and amaze up until the day she finally reveals her mask or will she simply disappear as swiftly as she emerged? Only time will tell. This artist is represented by Soho Contemporary Art in New York, Markowicz Fine Art Gallery in Miami and Galerie Fluegel-Roncak in Nurnberg.

Escif,"There are two types of graffiti art that are worth mentioning. The first one is the sort that blows us away with its visual appearance. The second one is the kind that conveys a message and it actually makes you stop and think about what might be painted on the wall. If you, as a graffiti artist, are managing to simultaneously coexist in both of those categories - well, you're doing something right. The art of the infamous Escif achieved both being wonderful for observing and having an important point to make. Only his work is not beautiful in the traditional sense of the word, but in an elegant, minimal way to which Escif stayed true for all of his career. This artist is making a conscious effort to get people to look at his work and not just focus on the pure aesthetic but rather be aware of what is happening - Escif explained it best: I´m not looking for decorative paintings, I try to wake up viewers' minds.  Escif regularly works on the walls of Valencia, but good luck catching him - he has stayed anonymous for nearly twenty years since he started painting. Back in the late '90, he came to the public attention with his black and white minimal design, as well as for his strange scenes that border anecdotes. Escif's pieces are deceptively simple yet inspired to a point they cause strong responses from viewers. He uses any masonry surfaces as vertical or horizontal canvases - from small cracks in walls to huge pieces of architecture. It's easy to imagine the real Escif as a caped man who runs as an invisible shadow during the night and seeks valid places to paint, all the while successfully avoiding police officers who haven't been able to catch him for two decades. But despite that illustrative thought, Escif does not consider graffiti to be a guerilla technique, but more of an art of action, of performance. Be that as it may, his art is kinda aggressive - it uses simple lines and figures to send a clear and direct message. Escif usually comments on the aspects of capitalism, politics, the economy and other sensitive social issues that plague modern metropolis.    Over the years, Escif developed his own personal symbology and such elements are incorporated repeatably onto his work. Black holes, walking walls, tumbling common objects; these are only a couple of examples that he often uses. This has led to a special kind of relationship with the citizens of Valencia - they feel as they know Escif personally, they know what to expect from him. His paintings became a part of Valencia as much as the buildings upon which Escif paints. This kind of relationship with viewers is not common amongst graffiti artists. But don't let that lead you to a conclusion Escif gets monotonous! Knowing someone is not the same as being able to predict them, is it? Escif is constantly evolving and developing new languages - just as the person changes, his art grows as well. Interestingly, if we were to catalogue his artwork from the first piece to the last, we would be able to see the development of his style to a point it's instantly possible to distinguish Escif's art from anything else you might compare him with. Escif tries to focus his work around concepts, not shapes and colors. But, ironically and honestly, his graffiti (or public art as he likes to call them) is some of the most apeling work we've seen in a long time.    The Escif constitutes his art on the fact it's all about the viewers - the only meaning to his work worth mentioning is the one viewer decides to give it. Audiences that accidently stumble upon his graffitis have the most honest opinion of all the viewers. That's why it's essential for his work to exist exclusively on the streets. For that reason, Escif has a strong belief that graffiti art is pure street art and as such is never under any circumstances to be taken from their urban environments. By doing this you take its validity, it's purpose. Escif himself said: graffiti as a concept implies transgression of public space, and because of this its institutional adaptation ceases to have value. Graffiti is on the street, in its natural condition, where it will die. Obviously, he feels taking his art to galleries is the same as destroying them. But, being anonymous as he is - at least for now - Escif is not really able to come out and stop such procedures from happening. He can only speak through the internet and the medium of graffiti with hopes that someone will listen. Luckily for Valencia, there is so much Escif artwork out there that it's practically impossible to tear them all down and put them on display in galleries and museums. A lucky break for the second largest city of Catalonia.   Escif is a Spaniard and belongs to the city of Valencia, but over the years, his work has become increasingly international. His graffiti apply to all of us living in this day and age. We don't know who Escif is, but we can safely presume he lets a little smile go for every time he sees his graffiti used on the other side of the planet. And it's used for a good reason - Escif's graffiti is simply mesmerizing. Such wide recognition might tempt some of us into revealing our identities, but not Escif who probably doesn't plan on coming out anytime soon. Furthermore, he stayed true to his (presumable) home city and Escif work sightings haven't been reported anywhere else but in Valencia for the last twenty years. Such behaviour makes us want to shake his hand and thank him for bringing back our faith in the romantic way of making art. If only we knew which hand to shake.

Peter Phillips,"Peter Phillips is a British Pop Artists whose work ranges from oils on canvas to multi-media compositions and collages.  Vibrant in color and filled with iconography of images drawn from daily life, Peter’s work appeals to the spectator’s memory, elevates curiosity and awakens their minds to the world around them. As one of the originators of Pop art, Phillips trained at the Royal College of Art with his contemporaries David Hockney, Allen Jones, R.B. Kitaj and others figures in British Pop Art. He presided as President of the Young Contemporaries 1961 Exhibition, hailed as a landmark in the movement. He worked and exhibited alongside fellow Royal College of Arts students like David Hockney, Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Patrick Caulfield and R.B. Kitaj. In 1965, he had his first one-man exhibition at the Kornblee Gallery, New York. When he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship, Peter moved to New York, where he exhibited his work alongside American counterparts Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist. Phillips later returned to Europe, where continued to paint and exhibit. While his style of painting has evolved over the years, his works continue to play with the viewer’s imagination, inviting multiple layers of interpretation and hidden meaning. Over thirty of his prints are in the Tate Collection. Phillips resides in Europe, where he continues to paint and exhibit. He travels frequently to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sydney.",1935
Diane Arbus,"Iconic for her intimate black-and-white portraits and the sudden death that shocked the world, Diane Arbus was a gifted American woman whose talent was only rivaled by her inner sorrows. She was an elite photographer of her generation, marking the time she was on this earth with some of the most awe-inspiring pieces the medium of photography has to offer to this day. Arbus shot a wide cast of characters in order to make her portraiture artworks as varied as possible. She often opted to photograph those who existed on the fringes of society and were abandoned in the margins, interested in capturing the lesser known and harsh truths that many dared not to acknowledge. For that reason, many of her subjects included the likes of dwarfs, giants, transgender people, nudists, circus performers and surreal individuals. Diane Arbus was also recognized for her brave and uncompromising approach as she would stop at nothing to get the perfect shot in line.  Arbus was born Diane Nemerov on the 14th of March in the year of 1923, in the heart of New York City. Her parents were David Nemerov and Gertrude Russek, a Jewish couple who owned Russek's, a famous and well-respected Fifth Avenue department store. Diane's family was quite wealthy and had no trouble making ends meet even during the times of the Great Depression, effectively allowing the young girl to be completely isolated from all the harshness that was plaguing the rest of the United States in the 1930s. After David Nemerov saw fit to take a step back and retire from directly running Russek's, he wanted to pursue an old dream and started painting, introducing a strong artistic element to his household. Additionally, Diane's younger sister wanted to be a sculptor for the majority of her life and the two's older brother, Howard Nemerov, would later become United States Poet Laureate. All of this played a factor in the forming of Diane's creative personality as she was literally surrounded by all shapes and types of artistic practices as she was growing up. However, she desired to be a part of something completely her own[1], something no other member of the Nemerov family had any say or experience in.   Diane Nemerov received her education by attending classes at the Fieldston School for Ethical Culture, a prestigious prep school. In the year of 1941, as the United States were entering the biggest human conflict in the history of war, Diane married her childhood sweetheart Allan Arbus. After the marriage was official, she took on the name that will eventually prove to be much more famous than her original name ever was - Diane Arbus. The two had a relatively happy marriage for the majority of its existence[2]. Their first daughter, Doon, was born in the year of 1945 and later become a respected writer when she entered womanhood. Diane and Allan had a second daughter as well, Amy, who was born in the year of 1954. Amy Arbus later became a photographer herself and, despite never reaching the level of recognition her mother did, was and still is an appreciated artist in her own right. For reasons never fully explained to the public, Diane and Allan Arbus separated in the year of 1959 and the divorce was finally concluded ten years after that. Despite being separated and later divorced from her husband, Diane never abandoned the surname of Arbus which remained her artistic alias for the rest of her life.  During the same year that was also the time of her marriage, Diane Arbus decided to visit the gallery of Alfred Stieglitz and learn about the secrets of photography from the best masters the United States had to offer. She observed the artworks and learned from the likes of Mathew Brady, Timothy O'Sullivan, Paul Strand, Bill Brandt and Eugène Atget. Many professional photographers were hired by her father over the years as well, especially when David was promoting some new features of his store. Diane observed how they worked and was surprisingly adept to understand many aspects and factors of the master photographers whose work she observed in 1941. During this time, Allan was a photographer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps in the World War Two. Upon his return to the States, the reunited couple had a shared interest in photo making practices. Diane and Allan began a commercial photography business called Diane & Allan Arbus in the year of 1946. In the initial stages of the firm, Diane was an art director and her husband was the de facto photographer. Diane & Allan Arbus collaborated with many companies such as Glamour, Seventeen, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and other magazines. Interestingly, both of them have stated on many occasions that they hate fashion photography[3]. However, the works of the newly found firm were described as mediocre at best.  During the year of 1956, Arbus quit the commercial photography business after she was discouraged from the lack of critical success, as well as wishing to belatedly pursue her own artistic goals for the first time in her life. Although Diane did study the art of camera pictures with Berenice Abbott at some point, Arbus' studies with Lisette Model, which began in 1956, was the most crucial personal experience the aspiring artist ever had. It was the influence of Lisette Model that led Diane to her recognizable style and well-known methods. Initially, she used a 35 mm Nikon camera which produced grainy rectangular imagery. By the year of 1959, Diane was photographing on assignments for magazines such as Esquire and The Sunday Times Magazine, enjoying a stellar recognition. Somewhere around the year of 1962, Arbus switched from her beloved 35 mm Nikon camera and started using a twin-lens reflex Rolleiflex camera which produced more detailed square images. She also began using a twin-lens reflex Mamiya camera with flash in addition to the Rolleiflex. Soon after that, Dian was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship[4] for a project on The American Rites, Manners and Customs.   Diane Arbus had a very personal approach to making photos. Her methods included establishing a strong relationship with her subjects and even re-photographing some of them over the course of many years. From the moment she emancipated herself from the work of her husband, she was highly appreciated in the world of photography and even held classes at the Parsons School of Design, the Cooper Union in New York City and the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. The first major exhibition of her photos occurred at the Museum of Modern Art in an influential 1967 show titled as New Documents. Alongside the works of numerous colleagues, Diane was presented as the core of what was described as a new generation of documentary photographers. As this is often the case with many authors, Arbus' magazine assignments decreased as her fame as an artist increased. She was not able to chase her own expression and was finally being appreciated for doing so. Using much softer light than in any of her previous projects, Diane took a series of photographs in her later years of people with intellectual disability showing a wide range of emotions. Many theories exist that state different kinds of relationships Arbus may have had with these photographs, some asserting that she adored them whilst some claiming that the author hated them. Regardless, this will prove to be the last big project of Diane's life. She experienced what her closest friends and relatives described as depressive episodes for the bigger part of her career, a condition that was probably inherited from her mother who suffered a similar condition[5]. These episodes may have been made worse by symptoms of hepatitis. These ups-and-downs and violent changes of mood reached their peak on the 26th of July in 1971. While living in the Westbeth Artists Community in New York City, Arbus took her own life by ingesting barbiturates and subsequently slashing her wrists with a razor blade. She was 48 years of age at the time.   In 1972, a year after she committed suicide, Arbus became the first photographer from the United States to have her photographs displayed at the Venice Biennale. This was, of course, done posthumously, but it never the less represents a huge milestone in the acknowledgment of the American photography. Her emotional portraits of individuals cast to the margins of society, all the homeless people, transvestites, nudists and carnival performers, all of them were finally allowed to tell their story on the global level in 1972. And the name of Arbus was echoing along every step of the way. As the case was for the majority of her career, some have seen Arbus’s work as highly controversial, some viewers were overwhelmed with a sense of compassion, while many others found her pictures bizarre and disturbing. Although we have no way of knowing this for a fact, we suppose that this was the way the author herself would have preferred it anyways. It should also be noted that in the year of 2007, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York acquired the entirety of Arbus’s archives, giving a clear cut and loud indicator of just how crucial Diane was to the modern art history of the United States.

Georg Baselitz,"Known for tackling the visceral reality of postwar Germany, Georg Baselitz is an artist who has been able to grasp the world’s attention for the last fifty years. Equally controversial, both his works and personal statements have provoked and strongly separated the public. He emerged as a pioneer of German Neo-Expressionist painting style, but from a European perspective, it is seen more as postmodern. Arguably, his strongest quality is the uncanny consistency with which he’s been creating for more than half a century. Always in the spotlight, he never truly belonged to mainstream, rather categorizing himself as an outsider opposed to expectations and popular trends.  Born as Hans-Georg Kern, the artist was raised in Deutschbaselitz in Germany. His father worked as a teacher at an elementary school, and the family lived in a flat above a schoolhouse. Young Georg first discovered the 19th-century pencil drawing in the school’s library, and these helped him to begin creating himself. When he was just eleven years old, he assisted wildlife photographer Helmut Drechsler on his ornithological photo shoots, which subsequently led to the painter’s later landscapes of the Saxony countryside, but also inspired the painting Wo ist der gelbe Milchkrug, Frau Vogel? meaning Where is the Yellow Milkjug, Mrs Bird? - a piece that featured upside-down yellow birds. This reversing of his subjects is also one of Baselitz’s trademark imagery, along with figuration and controversial themes. In 1950, the family moved to Kamens where he attended high school. Interlude During a Hunt in Wermersdorf Forest, a painting by Ferdinand von Rayski, hung in the school drill hall, and it greatly influenced the artist’s later pieces, including his very first inverted painting Der Wald auf dem Kopf (The Wood on its Head). Originally denied acceptance into the Art Academy in Dresden, Baselitz began studying painting under Herbert Behrens-Hangler in 1956 at the Academy of Visual and Applied Art in Weissensee, East Berlin. However, after just two terms, he was expelled because of his ""political immaturity"".[1] A year later, he enrolled at the Academy of Visual Arts in Charlottenburg, West Berlin, where he developed an interest in the work of Ernst-Wilhelm Nay, Wassily Kandinsky, and Kazimir Malevich.   In 1958, he adopted the name Baselitz in a tribute to his hometown, and the same year he met his future wife, Elke Kretzschmar. While still studying, the artist created a series of imaginary portraits, including the Rayski Head and Onkel Bernard, beginning to focus on German identity in the post-WWII era. The paintings were composed of thick, fluid brushstrokes, the individuals appearing more as caricatures rather than traditional realist portraits. Having previously lived under Nazis, followed by the Communist regime and the approved social realism he studied at college, Baselitz knew almost nothing about German expressionism, dadaism, surrealism or even cubism. Upon his arrival to West Germany, he attended a touring show of the American painting, and “suddenly here was abstract expressionism. Paintings by Pollock, de Kooning, Guston, Still and many others, in the very buildings where I took classes every day. It was overwhelming. And not just for me. Even the professors had not seen this sort of work before.""[2] In the early 1960s, he concentrated on specific archetypes in paintings and woodcuts, mostly of rebels, heroes, and shepherds, becoming increasingly interested in anamorphosis, the distorted or monstrous representation of an image, as exemplified in the proportions and facial features of his figures. Experimentation was the only way to reinvent his exaggerated art style, and in 1969, attempting to free the style from the subject matter, Baselitz painted his first inverted piece entitled Der Wald auf dem Kopf (The Wood on its Head). A decade later, he once again reinvented his approach to art, making a decision to start producing sculptures.    These sculptures, similarly to his paintings, were unrefined, forceful, and crude. By refraining himself from polishing his works, the artist would often simply leave the surface uneven, scratched, and chipped, adding to rough-hewn appearance. In 1980, his already established reputation was confirmed when was chosen to represent his country at the Venice Biennale. The prestigious event was the perfect opportunity to exhibit his first sculptural artwork – Model for a Sculpture. It was a crudely carved wooden figure which immediately sparked controversy due to the similarity of its out-raised arm gesture to a Nazi salute. It was one of many controversies regarding his work. Baselitz is also known for having some questionable opinions. For example, his infamous claim that women can’t paint raised more than a few of eyebrows. Basing it on the many years of teaching experience, where the percentage of female students was up to 80%, he stated: “Women don't paint very well. It's a fact. There are, of course, exceptions. Agnes Martin or, from the past, Paula Modersohn-Becker. I feel happy whenever I see one of her paintings. But she is no Picasso, no Modigliani and no Gauguin.”[3] He added Helen Frankenthaler, Cecily Brown, and Rosemarie Trockel to the list of exceptions, saying that he respects their work. Attempting to provide an explanation, he stated: “There is, of course, quite a lot of brutality in art. Not brutality against others, but brutality against the thing itself, against what already exists. When Modersohn-Becker painted herself, she looked very unpleasant, and extremely ugly…”, and “…she hesitated to destroy others, in other words, to really destroy Gauguin by going beyond his art. Men have no problem with that. They just do it. But you must know that I do love women.”   In 2005, the painter introduced the ‘Remix’ in his work, marking the return to key phases of his own artistic history. This concept included making new versions of the previous works, now painted intuitively, with quick and spontaneous flashes of bright, transparent color. It also allowed him to revisit and excavate the past, pushing his own painterly vocabulary to create works that are fresh and liberated. Baselitz revisits paintings such as The Great Friends and Finger Painting-Eagle in a dynamic process that virtually reinterprets the original versions' significant features, thereby transposing the artist's work into a more contemporary framework.[4] The impulse to improve, clarify, and update is clearly evident, but the haunting, fleeting quality of the Remix work has also to do with a mature artist's meditations on time, presence, failure and possibility. In 2014, faced with the possibility of Germany introducing a new legislation concentrated on the protection of the country’s culture (which would have brought significant financial damage to galleries, dealers, and artists), Baselitz pulled his artworks that were loaned to some of biggest German art museums. Near the end of 2015, the artist had a show at CFA Berlin, where dogs weren’t just a banal decoration in the corner of the canvas, but take a central stage and the artist identifies strongly with his animal subjects. The exhibition’s title Sigmund's Cave is spelled out above and around every subject, thus alluding to the fact that these are not simple dog portraits but rather codes of a Freudian universe. In 2016, Baselitz had a major solo show at White Cube in London, entitled Wir fahren aus, where he occupied the entire gallery space and showed his monumental paintings and sculptures.   Best known for the incredible quality and consistency present in his work, Georg Baselitz was exposed to Social Realism and Abstract Expressionism before playing a major role in reviving the German Expressionism and ushering a path for Neo-Expressionism. Inspired by the work of Edvard Munch and Philip Guston, the artist himself inspired many others, including Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Presenting himself as an outsider, he put a lot of effort in reviving symbols of German national identity that were tarnished after World War II. After much experimentation and after conquering nearly every artistic medium, Baselitz has established a reputation of being not just one of the German best known painters, but as one of the most famous artists in the world. He is represented by White Cube, Gagosian, and Kunzt Gallery.  References:  ",1937
Antony Gormley,"Fascinated by the human body, British artistAntony Gormley explores the intricate relationship of our physical manifestation, our body, within the “confines” of space and moments in time. His sculptures of anthropomorphic figures convey emotions and stories based on the language the bodies display, crouching in exasperation or lying in abandon, inviting the audience to rethink their relationship with their own body and surroundings.  Antony Gormley’s never-ending source of inspiration and subject of exploration, the human body, can be seen envisioned through different prisms of perspective in the works of this prolific artist. Cast in metal, made out of light fiberglass, wrought out of wire or put together out of blocks of wood– Gormley’s sculptures touch on different aspects of our physical form. Largely minimalistic, subtracting all that doesn’t make up the bare essence of human form, this work “attempts to materialize the place at the other side of appearance where we all live.”[1] Antony has used his own body to create molds on which many of his works are based. The creation of these molds is not something to be taken lightly, as the model being cast has to remain still for up to two hours, making the task as much a mental trial as it is physical. He uses his own body because it is, as he states, “the closest experience of matter that I will ever have and the only part of the material world that I live inside.”[2]  Born on August 30, 1950, in London, England, Gormley (whose full name is Antony Mark David Gormley) was the youngest of seven children born to a German mother and an Irish father. He studied archaeology, anthropology and the history of art at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1968 where he was influenced by artists-in-residence Barry Flanagan and Michael-Craig Martin. He traveled to India and Sri Lanka to learn about Buddhism and meditation practice between 1971 and 1974, acquiring mental skills which surely proved useful later on when enduring the process of creating molds from his own body. After attending Saint Martin's School of Art and Goldsmiths in London from 1974, he completed his studies with a postgraduate course in sculpture at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London. Gormley won the Turner Prize in 1994 with Field for the British Isles. He has been a Royal Academician since 2003 and a Trustee of the British Museum since 2007. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, honorary doctor of the universities of Teesside and Cambridge, and a fellow of Trinity and Jesus Colleges, Cambridge. He was the recipient of the Obayashi Prize in 2012 and is the 2013 Praemium Imperiale laureate for sculpture. Gormley was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to the arts.   His debut was a solo exhibition held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1981, and since then he has continually impressed audiences. His sculptures are often displayed at public places; the 1998 winged giant steel statue Angel of the North (20m tall with wings measuring 54m) keeps guard near Gateshead in Tyne and Wear, England. Event Horizon, a series of open-air installations he has done in a number of cities has him putting 31 anatomically correct casts of his body on rooftops, windows, and other common spaces in the skyline of the cities. In the artist’s eye, the onlookers become statues themselves as they look up to the sky and point to the statues in wonder. The artist first ""aired"" this exhibition in London (2007), and has since used it to intervene with the skylines of New York (2010), Rio de Janeiro (2012) and Hong-Kong (2015-2016).

Thomas Schutte,"Thomas Schütte is a German sculptor and draughtsman born in 1954 in Oldenburg, Germany. He attended the Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf (1973 – 1981), where he studied alongside  Fritz Schwegler and Gerhard Richter. Although he is one of the leading sculptors of our time, he also works across media in watercolor, and drawings that are of the diaristic form, and are often presented in books. His early work consists of simple architectural models that suggest both ideal and quotidian living environments that draw attention to the social engineering involved in post-war reconstruction. Instead of taking on a role of an influential artist who is also a social leader, dictated by Joseph Beuys, Thomas takes a detached view of contemporary life, which is quite often humorous.  His work has often been characterized as non-developmental.   A preoccupation with figuration and human conditions became increasingly evident throughout the 1980s and 90s. At the core of Thomas’ work is the human being. It takes many forms, sometimes it is grotesque, sometimes realistic, or even a self-portrait, or a portrait of a member of his family. But it is always a person that the viewer confronts. Thomas likes the concept of faces who become drawings or figures, emphasizing the difference in approach. Watercolors are very personal for him, and they give many options on enriching the face and its expression. But what Thomas likes the most is working with the material. Unlike the modern workings of people’s brain, like in marketing and advertisement, he likes to work on the face and figure. The artist underlines the importance of both successful and failed tries, which together form a process and not just a product. Somehow, Thomas manages to undermine the form, he gives it a twist. His sculptures reinvent all the rules of facial feature composition, and these weird-looking humans just stand there looking at us.    Schütte’s works have been exhibited at museums and galleries around the world, such as the National Gallery in London, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others. During the 1990s, he created a variety of large-scale public sculptures, such as Large Ghosts(1996), a set of three figures that appear simultaneously robotic and corporeal. More recently, in the late 1990s and 2000s, Schütte began creating other sculptural works, including a series of large, three-dimensional, free-standing heads, as well as a collection of One Man Houses, which are small, detailed architectural models of a modern home. One of his latest exhibitions revolves around a red bronze head. His latest architectural display, opened in 2016, is his own private museum, near Düsseldorf. A very distinctive concrete building with wooden slatting and a convex overhanging roof. The Museum is closed for alterations until April 20th, 2017. Thomas doesn’t want to burden his children with his colossal sculptures, after his death, since storing them would be rather expensive. A building that he designed lets him exhibit his sculptures, and store them underground.   ",1939
Yue Minjun,"Widely considered to be one of the most humoristic and unique artists that emerged from China in recent decades, Yue Minjun is a Beijing-based painter and sculptor that uses the same motif in every single piece he creates - his own face, usually pink and frozen in a state of hysterical laughter. His self-illustrations are arranged in various settings, some ironically usual and some far from ordinary - like a scene placed amidst a Jurassic period with two Juis laughing their hearts off beside a BMW, or a bunch of giggling Minjuns shooting another bunch of Minjuns who also have wide smiles on their faces. This artist primarily works in oil but has been also recorded using prints and watercolors, as well as the aforementioned sculptures, always maintaining his laughing face leitmotif.  Minjun was born during the year of 1962, in a town of Daqing, a city in the west of Heilongjiang province of China. For the majority of his life, Yui’s father worked in the oil fields of northeast China, so naturally his son also spent many working days alongside him. However, Yue departed the world of the oil industry in order to begin his studies in art during the year of 1983 when he entered the halls of Hebei Normal University. Although he was a good student, Minjun did not truly manage to find his own style despite tirelessly trying to do so. However, this all changed in 1989 as he visited the China / Avant-Garde show in Beijing, an exhibition centered around paintings of Geng Jianyi - in them, the artist depicted his own laughing face and turned that into the main motif of the works. Inspired by such a concept, Minjun decided he would use the same idea, but due to the political state of China at the time, he was forced to move to a colony outside Beijing in 1990. There, Yue had all the time and space to slowly develop his visuals - the signature style that made him famous came to be from Minjun’s depictions of his bohemian friends also present in the colony. He quickly earned recognition of art pundits for his portraits, whilst the paintings of his own smiling visage, often cloned on numerous figures, gained him incredible critical acclaim and led to numerous international exhibitions of his work. Interestingly enough, Yue’s style did not stop evolving after he became famous - instead, it kept on rapidly developing without playing it safe, constantly presenting the audiences with new concepts and settings, whilst maintaining a very dynamic relationship with the viewers. Minjun did so by continuously adapting his work to current political and social circumstances of his nation, as well the situations from the rest of the world on some occasions.   Yue Minjun and his artworks have often been classified as a part of the famous Chinese movement that started out in the year of 1989 - the Cynical Realism. Although many of the aspects this movement holds dear can indeed be found in the compositions of this artist, Minjun uncompromisingly rejects this label and insists that his art is a unique moment in history, unclassifiable to any registered style. However, Yue has also stated that he does not really concern himself about what people call him, so it’s reasonable to assume he does not find the Cynical Realism connection an unrealistic one, but rather a not perfectly fitting one. As was said before, Yue Minjun’s style never stopped evolving and adapting ever since it was formed during the years of 1989 and 1990 - instead, it made a habit out of reflecting current situations mostly surrounding the nation of China. Yue often challenged these social and cultural conventions by incorporating objects and even political issues in a radical and abstract manner, placing his smiling image in the midst of the composition. Using the exaggerated expressiveness of cartooning and the stylistic rendering of graphic illustration, Yue depicts his cloned doppelgangers as contorted and grotesque, all scalded pink skin and maniacal toothy cackles. These unique figures are a clear denotation of violence and vulnerability in most of his images, as Minjun uses them as both antagonists and anti-heroes, depending on the pieces circumstances. Although his themes are always somehow indicating the state of China and his laughing face motif was adopted from a fellow painter of the same country, Yue also bases many of his compositions on well known European masterpieces. By doing so, Minjun subverts the grandiose aura of art history at the world level, relying on his aesthetics with a strong pop note - another western influence - to do the job.  Although China has presented us with some incredible artists in recent decades, Minjun truly manages to stand out from such as impressive crowd - mostly due to his sense of humor which is unrivaled, but also his instinct for depicting the right social moments and clever ways of incorporating them. Yue's printed and sculpted artworks are a unique reflection of true nature of reality, humoristically parading as an endless cynical guffaw. Even though he mostly concentrates on Eastern issues, Yue’s works are also quite relatable to Westerners, which in return makes him extremely interesting for all the world’s art scenes and markets. The artist is represented by PACE GALLERY Beijing, PACE GALLERY Hong Kong, PACE GALLERY London, PACE GALLERY Menlo Park and WENG CONTEMPORARY.  ",1940
Tony Cragg,"Born in Liverpool in 1949 Tony Cragg is one of the world’s foremost sculptors. Before attending Gloucester and Wimbledon School of Art, he was working as a lab technician at the National Rubber Producers Research Association. In 1977. he received his MA at the Royal College of Art. It wasn’t too long until his first solo exhibition at Lisson Gallery, which took place in 1979. Tony represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1988 and was rewarded the prestigious Turner Prize. His fruitful career deserved a retrospective that took place in 1996. at the Pompidou Center in Paris, followed by a solo exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1997. It seems like the British artist never rests, and keeps on exhibiting extensively worldwide, having done more than 700 exhibitions to this date. The latest exhibition dating March 4th this year, with new sculptures and drawings are drawn from a nearly fifty-year career. His art was demonstrated at Yorkshire Sculpture Park both in the Underground Gallery and open air.  From an early age, and throughout his life Tony has had an interest in science and natural history. His work experience in the Laboratory reflected in his vigorous approach to the material. In his early works, he has used discarded construction and household materials. During the 1970s his sculptures included techniques such as stacking, splitting and crushing. His taxonomical understanding of the world was impeccably presented in these early, stacked works. For Cragg, manmade objects are merely fossilized keys to a past time which is our present. In the 1980s he started making floor and wall arrangements that would appear painting-like. Here, he utilized manmade objects to depict natural landscapes, at the same time blurring the line between these two notions. Together, they create an outline of something familiar, and the part contributes to the picture of wholeness. The artist is constantly pushing the limits of the relations between people and the material world, where at the same time it seems his ideas or forms he might devise are limitless. His ingenuity never seizes to amaze us.    For the famous sculptor, form and meaning are interdependent, almost as if a chemical reaction takes place. In his own words – he sees a material or an object as having a balloon of information around it, this having said, it is clear how any change in form changes the balloon in question. Playing with material and material forms is a study in which Cragg conveys how they affect and shape our ideas and emotions. Cragg left Britain in 1977 and moved to western Germany, where he began teaching at the Kunst Akademie in Düsseldorf, just a year later. One of his pieces that best presents his stacking technique is called New Stones – Newton's Tones (1978). For this sculpture he arranged collected plastic fragments into color categories, once more changing the bubble of information of these discarded items. In his later pieces, there is a shift of interest as he switches to different materials, like bronze, glass, steel, and wood. Juxtaposing these pieces in an unlikely way gives the artist space for manipulations. Tony always uses different methods of binding structures together, creating unique forms.    Tony’s sculptures from wood are rigorous, but also sturdy and jagged, with curves. Unlike his bronze and steel sculptures which appear to be liquid or molten. Most frequently used shades of bronze range from black and brown to yellow and red. His stainless steel sculptures are mirror-finished. And sculptures are not all that he has been making throughout the years. There is a considerable amount of drawings as well. Since there are some laws applied to the form of sculpture, like statics and gravity, drawing is a form in which Cragg can explore ideas and forms, he couldn't otherwise.   This prolific artist has received many awards throughout his career. Tony has presented his country at the 43rd Venice Biennale, and in 1994 was elected Royal Academician. His work has been the subject of many international exhibitions, at the most prestigious museums and galleries, including Tate Liverpool in 2000, The Louvre in Paris in 2011, just to name few. To top his academic career, from 2009 - 2013 he is appointed Director of Kunst Akademie in Düsseldorf, Germany. His sculptures continue to tickle our aesthetic sense and question our notion of man vs the material world, rendering new outlooks on the world.    ",1941
Marc Quinn,"Easily the most controversial member of the famed Young British Artists, Marc Quinn is a sculptor with some very notorious notions attached to his reputation. Just so you can get a sense of what makes Quinn so provocative as a creator, we'll tell you about his series rather appropriately titled Blood Head - a collection of self-portraits sculpted with over nine pints of the artist's own frozen blood. Marc is also quite talented when working with traditional materials such as bronze, but even those kinds of pieces are underlined by bizarre elements. Usually, these extreme touches to Quinn's sculptures are the poses of contorted subjects or depictions of people with unusual physical characteristics, such as group portrait of amputees or those who have undergone sex-change surgery.   Marc Quinn was born in London during the year of 1964. He studied both history and the history of art at the prestigious Robinson College in Cambridge. For many of his younger years, Quinn worked as an assistant to the sculptor Barry Flanagan. This experience provided him with a strong understanding of how the medium of sculpture can be pushed beyond its limitations - a feature which massively helped Marc when he began to exhibit his pieces in the early 1990s. This was the time he was started to be connected to the YBA phenomenon. For the next two and a half decades, it's incredible how the public never lost interest in Quinn's work as his popularity is constantly on a high note[1]. During this time, Marc held exhibitions is such institutions as the Tate Gallery and  Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin and Fondazione Prada in Milan. He also created many artworks for charity, highlighted by the gold sculpture of Kate Moss which was auctioned off for the benefit of The Elephant Family in the year of 2010.   Although Marc's portfolio is mostly highlighted by sculptures, he did test himself in painting as well. Whichever medium he is working in, Quinn always seeks to explore the distanced relationship we have with our bodies. His work and exhibitions want to make us search for our own self, to get us in contact with our own hidden portrait. This was a good news in the late 1990s as not many authors of that time were putting the audience in contact with both the selected and self reflections as good as Marc did. Quinn desires to make us aware just how the ideas of natural and cultural are having an impact on the contemporary psyche of an everyday man. Due to his technical skill, Marc has been occasionally connected with the Greek and Roman statuary and their depictions of an idealized whole. However, his most notable works have all been made from extremely unconventional materials, such as the aforementioned use of his own frozen blood. Besides his more straight forwards sculpturing, Quinn has also examined the implications of genetic modification and scientific advancement within our culture. His DNA Garden project from 2001 featured the DNA of 75 different plant species combined with gene codes of two humans. The idea was to re-stage the settings and conditions of the Garden of Eden through scientific means in a studio.   Ultimately, we believe that it's time we start calling Quinn the most successful artist of the YBA group. His explorations of the human form and the utilization of rather unconventional materials are put together in a phenomenon mix and it's a genuine challenge finding a similar artist to Mark Quinn. Are his pieces sometimes hard to stomach? Sure. Are some of his sculptures bordering the nightmare realm? Absolutely. But this is what a good contemporary artist does - he provokes[2]. This was the case for the likes of Marcel Duchamp and many other avant-garde authors. Quinn is simply introducing more modern provocations brought to the new level of the 21st century and its own set of standards which determine what exactly is controversial.  This artist is represented by White Cube Bermondsey London, White Cube Mason's Yard London, Pop Fine Art Los Angeles, Weng Contemporary and Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac Paris Marais.  References:   ",1942
Hurvin Anderson,"Hurvin Anderson is a British painter, born in 1965 in Birmingham, United Kingdom, to parents of Jamaican origin. His education, he got at Wimbledon School of Art, which he enrolled in 1991, and received a BA with Honors in painting, in 1994. His MA in painting he got at Royal College of Art, London, at which he studied from 1996 till 1998. His series of paintings titled Peter’s, that are depicting the interiors of barbers’ shops, in particular one, owned by Peter Brown, which Anderson was visiting often with his father when he was a child, are probably his most famous works. These works are inspired by his upbringing in Birmingham’s Afro-Caribbean community, in which the shop that is theme in Anderson’s paintings was a place for conversation as well as for cutting hair. It was a social retreat, vital for many male members of the local Caribbean community. About his use of color in these series could be noted that each of these paintings is rendered as a basic tricolor flag: earthy red carpet, blue walls, white ceiling. In his art can be seen that he depicts sites of leisure, where the mind is usually free to wander. Colin Perry in Frieze Magazine described the artist's work as ""a vision of an awkwardly accommodated immigrant culture"". Because he was raised in the rainy and gray English Midlands, he always had a vision of warmer, more colorful country. Paintings of the Caribbean he created show this kind of perception. His paintings engage with the traditions of landscape painting and the history of abstraction. It could be said that his art is somewhere between abstraction and figuration. Subjects of his paintings are developed from both of the Jamaican and British culture, and he prefers to create his works rather from photographs, than memory. Besides his tendencies to use warm and earthly colors for his paintings, he is very well able to depict darker, quieter feelings, with an almost monochrome palette. His Untitled (Black Street) in blacks, grays and blues, depicts a night scene with an almost palpable tension. With these, limited tones, he captures a series of senses, rather than a visual description of this place, showing the cool damp stillness and deadened quiet of early hour suburbia. Unlike in his Untitled (Welcome Series) where he uses warm colors and cool whites and greys to transform the familiar contours of a street front store into a deceptively illusory space. For his work Anderson received, Alkazzi Travel Award, in 1996, in New York, John Crane Award, in 1997, also in New York, Caribbean Contemporary Arts Residency Programme, in Trinidad, in 2002, and a residency at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, in 2005. His paintings have been exhibited in solo museum shows at Tate Britain, London, Studio Museum Harlem, New York, Michael Werner, New York, Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, England, Thomas Dane Gallery, London, and others. His work is held in significant public collections, including the Saatchi Gallery in London and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Anderson is represented by Thomas Dane in London and Michael Werner in New York, and he has also been making prints at Durham Press since 2009. He lives and works in London, United Kingdom.",1943
Tauba Auerbach,"The precise and formal approach which Tauba Auerbach applies on her art practice provide her with the reputation of a purist. The propensity for purified and minimal forms is present from the very begging of her career, yet it is as time passes by the maturity of her expression becomes apparent. The constant enchantment with science, especially mathematics and physics, leads Auerbach on the path of creating carefully taught exhibitions. Ongoing interest in variations on the theme of perception, in general, suggests focused and concise agenda practically embedded in the artist’s desire to expand the conventional notions of spatial experience and dimensionality.  Tauba Auerbach was born in 1981, in San Francisco. Growing up in a family of theater designers directed her from an early age towards arts and naturally, the desire to become art professional was not surprising. In 2003 she graduated from Stanford University with a BA in Visual Art and in parallel with the studies from 2002-2005 was apprenticed and worked as a sign painter at New Bohemia Signs gallery in San Francisco. From that period Auerbach’s activity is pulsating since she realized numerous solo projects and collaborations on the fringes of media and genre and exhibited constantly in museum and gallery context.   At first glance, the projects of Tauba Auberich are of the conceptualist ones. Nevertheless, influences from minimal, op and kinetic art and even Fluxus movement are rather obvious. Despite the fact that minimalist and simplified interventions she produces transfer the artist’s interest in manipulating with systems, modules or formations, it’s the wit that makes them progressive and different. As a matter of fact, the art practice of Auberich functions as a reflection of contemporary visual respectively digital culture and a subverted reply to the quote Less is More by famous modernist architect Mies Van Der Rohe often used to describe reduced forms and concepts.[1]   Great role in Auerbach’s artistic career presents Diagonal Press, a publishing unit that has founded in 2013. Throughout this agency, she publishes books, type specimens and promotes other items such as badges and manipulatives, which still is in contact with her art. It appears to be the extension of her previous experiments on with text, fold and grain paintings, etc. Although the artist was mainly focused on restrictions of two-dimensional surfaces, with hybrid musical objects, which are in between traditional sculpture and a musical instrument, she went one step further engaging even participation and performance in her work.[2] Therefore, by activating mind, body and soul at the simultaneously she accentuates the aim of her experiments – reaching into other realm or rather creating an atmosphere of contemplation in the terms of different dimensionality.   The art of Tauba Auerbach seems to be constantly sleeping away in regards to a category or genre. Her conceptual grip is similar to a surgical incision, it is meticulous but intended to remove some kind of condition. Therefore, it is not relevant for Auerbach’s work to be classified since it’s constantly stirring from conventional art narratives and transforms over and over again. The last but not the least layer of her exceptional work is the importance of female experience and it’s indivisibility from the crafts. The specter of activities that involve the processing of materials suggest not just mere artistic infatuation, yet those gestures reflect the artist’s independence and vigor which makes it related to feminist strategies in art.

Maurizio Cattelan,"Playing the role of the art world’s resident jokester for the last two and a half decades, Maurizio Cattelan is a contemporary Italian artist who has been amusing and horrifying viewers for the entirety of his career. Appreciated equally for both his dark humor and his vivid sculptures, Cattelan frequently depicts celebrities, political individuals, figures from art history and animals in comically absurd scenes with deep meanings. Also a prolific curator and a talented writer outside of his artistic practices[1], Maurizio Cattelan's mix of humor and realism is matched by no other author out there. Finding inspiration in the notions of Dadaism and Surrealism, his concepts and ideas are so impressive that many experts believe this artist is one of Duchamp’s greatest contemporary heirs.  Initially, Maurizio Cattelan started his career in the 1980s when he was making wooden furniture in Forlì, a city in Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy. During this time, Cattelan met some very talented designers who helped him set up his artistic manner and basis of his future artworks. One of these individuals was Ettore Sottsass, an Italian architect and designer. Eventually, Maurizio was given an opportunity to break into the scene of design and contemporary art when he optimistically sent out a catalog of his works to local galleries. Back then, Cattelan created a sculpture of an ostrich with its head buried deeply in the ground and wearing a costume of a figurine with a giant head of Picasso on it. The Italian galleries were fascinated by his creation and were lining up to get a chance at displaying Maurizio's pieces regardless of the author's demands and requirements. During this period which proved to be Maurizio's climb to the top, he also created the Oblomov Foundation - an engraved glass artwork which further catapulted the Italian artist to the elite of his country. Since the time of his emergence, Maurizio Cattelan has been establishing himself as an art scene’s joker who lacked any sort of compromise and had no trouble conveying any message he desired. All were fascinated with the ability this artist presented - Jonathan P. Binstock, curator of contemporary art at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, described the early Cattelan as ”one of the great post-Duchampian artists and a smartass, too”. This was in part due to this author's ability to utilize media in order to expose reality as well as blur the lines between fact and myth[2].  Since his climb to the very top, Cattelan established a style which oftentimes utilized taxidermy, a practice that flourished during the mid-1990s. This method of art-making demands that one connects humans and animals through the projections of human emotions which the former places on the latter[3]. One such piece is Novecento (1997), an artwork which involves a horse named Tiramisu which alludes to a sense of hopelessness and desperation. A similar example of taxidermy is Bidibidobidiboo (1996) - for this piece, Maurizio created a miniature depiction of a squirrel slumped over its kitchen table with a revolver at its feet. Not Afraid of Love (2000) may also serve as a fine indicator of how Cattelan uses taxidermy. In 1999, the Italian author started making life-size wax models of various people, himself included. A definite highlight of such pieces, although a bit controversial one, is La Nona Ora. This composition presented the museum viewers with an effigy of Pope John Paul II in a full ceremonial dress - being crushed by a meteor!  As he matured both as a persona and as an author, Maurizio Cattelan turned more towards publishing and curating, spending most of his time between 2005 and 2010 doing exactly that. However, Cattelan’s visual arts remain this artist's greatest contribution to the scenes around the world. All of his works make fun of various systems of order, including smaller aspects such as social niceties and much larger notions such as the main concepts of religion and faith[4]. His themes and motifs are carefully chosen so they are able to convey the message in a best possible way, often leading to dark humor situations which are now considered to be the tip of Cattelan's creative spear. Ultimately, Maurizio aims to highlight the bizarre nature of the world and our interventions within it no matter where they may lie. In such attempts, no method nor motif is off the table. Cattelan's artworks were awarded on numerous times during the author's career[5], with the gold medal granted by the 15th Rome Quadriennale serving as a crown achievement so far.   Enacting morbidly humorous transformations on objects and figures, there are not many artists out there capable of delivering such a unique artistic punch to the audiences. Cattelan's biting and surreal satire is one of the most characteristic visual vocabularies found in the contemporary scene. The way Maurizio is able to manipulate our emotions is unmatched by any other author as no one is able to make us wonder, laugh and be frighten at the same time as Cattelan's art is. This alone should be enough to cement this author's name in the art history of Italy, making Maurizio one of the key authors of this nation's contemporary scene.

Cai Guo-Qiang,"Contemporary artist Cai Guo-Qiang is renowned for his innovative, politically charged pieces, ranging from installations and performances to works on paper, which incorporate gunpowder and explosions. Cai was born in Quanzhou in the Fujian Province of China, and studied Set Design at the Shanghai Drama Institute and Art at the PS 1 Contemporary Art Center in New York. In 1986, he moved to Japan, where he began to use gunpowder in his work as a way of challenging the social and cultural repression of the Chinese Cultural Revolution of previous years. Drawing freely from ancient mythology, military history, Taoist cosmology, extraterrestrial observations, Maoist revolutionary tactics, Buddhist philosophy, gunpowder-related technology, Chinese medicine, and methods of terrorist violence, Cai’s art is a form of social energy, constantly mutable, linking what he refers to as “the seen and unseen worlds.”  Cai’s use of gunpowder has become central to his practice, leading to his experimentation with explosives and the development of his signature ignition events. Drawn to the medium for its myriad of associations, his gunpowder work, in addition to his repertoire of large-scale installations and social projects, draws upon Eastern philosophy, Maoist sentiment, and contemporary social issues. Though his fireworks are immediate signifiers of Chinese culture, Cai’s aim is to transcend these boundaries, establishing dialogue between viewers and the world around them. Cai initially began working with gunpowder to foster spontaneity and confront the suppressive, controlled artistic tradition and social climate in China. While living in Japan from 1986 to 1995, Cai explored the properties of gunpowder in his drawings, an inquiry that eventually led to his experimentation with explosives on a massive scale and the development of his signature ""explosion events"". In 1990, Cai began ""Projects for Extraterrestrials"", which consisted of using large fireworks and extensive trails of blazing gunpowder that span across landscapes and building surfaces. Site-specific, the projects were implemented in various locations throughout the world. Project to Extend the Great Wall of China by 10,000 Meters: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 10 (1993) was representative of the nature of the projects as a whole, as it involved an approximately six-mile-long gunpowder fuse that extended beyond the western end of the Great Wall at the edge of the Gobi Desert.""The Century with Mushroom Clouds: Project for the 20th Century"" (1995-96), conducted at symbolic locations in the United States to, as Cai has said, ""depict the 'face' of the nuclear bomb that represents modern-day technology."" Cai was awarded the Japan Cultural Design Prize in 1995 and the Golden Lion at the 48th Venice Biennale in 1999. In the following years, he has received the 7th Hiroshima Art Prize (2007), the 20th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize (2009), and AICA’s first place for Best Project in a Public Space for Cai Guo-Qiang: Fallen Blossoms (2010).  His first-ever solo exhibition in Brazil, Cai Guo-Qiang: Da Vincis do Povo, went on a three-city tour around the country in 2013. Traveling from Brasilia to São Paulo before reaching its final destination in Rio de Janeiro, it was the most visited exhibition by a living artist worldwide that year with over one million visitors.  His most recent exhibition Cai Guo-Qiang: The Ninth Wave opened in August 2014 at the Power Station of Art in Shanghai. He lives and works in New York.",1946
Raymond Pettibon,"Raymond Pettibon is a witty American illustrator and cartoonist, best known for his comic-like drawings which always contain intelligently disturbing, ironic messages. Pettibon’s art is sometimes violent and almost always rebellious, against the system. His medium of choice is ink on paper and many of his early drawings are black and white. However, Pettibon likes to experiment and he introduces colors to his pieces through the use of watercolor, collage, gouache and acrylic paint. Pettibon’s exciting career started in the Southern California in the late 1970s and 1980s, influenced by pop and punk culture. Many of his famous illustrations can be found on the legendary album covers of rock stars, in various comics and as a part of concert flyers. [caption id=""attachment_286964"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Raymond Pettibon - You killed Murdered, 2007 (Left) - End the War..., 2007 (Right)[/caption]  Pettibon was born in Tucson, Arizona in 1957 as Raymond Ginn. He changed his name to Pettibon because his father gave him the nickname petit bon, which means a good little boy. His educational background wasn’t originally related to visual arts. Pettibon studied economics and became a high school math teacher before his decision to return to college. Eventually, he graduated with a BFA from the prestigious UCLA. Pettibon’s visual style and ideas became quickly recognizable and appreciated in the colorful, liberated world of the late 70s. The artist’s drawings encompass the large spectrum of cultural issues - the deviances of the marginalized youth, literature, sports, sexuality, and even religion. There is also a common set of motifs and personalities depicted in many of Pettibon’s pieces and these are Charles Manson, surfers, baseball players, Elvis Presley and violent young punkers. Pettibon’s paper-based pieces combine images and text, often borrowed from literature. Even though some of Pettibone’s images are stand-alone works, they are much more often paired with handwritten text. When it comes to Pettibon’s influences in literature, these are all preeminent writers, such as Henry James, John Ruskin, William Faulkner and James Joyce. Pettibon claims that his interest in combining illustrations with text is rooted in the influence of poets such as William Blake. Pettibon is a prolific artist who made hundreds and hundreds of original drawings. In 1978, he started to publish them arranged as limited-edition booklets, called Superflux Pubs. These booklets are considered the sum of Pettibon’s brilliant ideas and visions. By the mid-80s, Pettibon has changed his style and started working in collage. He was using prevalently newspaper and magazine pieces combined with simple black and white images.   Some of Pettibon’s best-known illustrations are featured on popular album covers. In the late 70s and early 80s, the artist has produced a large number of uniquely humorous artworks on fliers and similar promotional materials, such as posters, stickers, and finally album covers, which were really well received when it comes to the international marketplace for art. His most appreciated work from this period was an illustration for his brother's band known as the Black Flag. Around the same time, Pettibon has worked with many other popular punk and rock bands, such as the Dead Kennedys, the Ramones, and Meat Puppets.  [caption id=""attachment_286960"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""755""] Raymond Pettibon - No Title (A look A), 2010[/caption]  Pettibon’s exhibiting career started in the 1980s. By the early 90s, he was already quite famous and he the won the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award. In the late 90s, he released an anthology of his pieces called Raymond Pettibon: A Reader. A few years later, in 2001 Pettibon won a brilliant international award for his work – it was the Wolfgang Hahn Prize from the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany. In 2004, the prestigious Whitney Museum of American Art in New York awarded him the Bucksbaum Prize. Because of the universal nature and wide acceptance of his artistic style, Pettibon’s work has been exhibited widely throughout the United States and abroad. Most important venues which have held his solo exhibitions are the Kumu Kunstimuuseum in Tallinn, Estonia, Kunstmuseum Luzern in Lucerne, Switzerland, Kestnergesellschaft in Hanover, Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. There are also many museum collections who proudly feature Pettibon’s pieces and these are the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart in Berlin, The Israel Museum in Jerusalem, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and also Tate Gallery in London, among others.   Pettibon’s most recent show is called Homo Americanus and it is currently on view at the Deichtorhallen Hamburg - Sammlung Falckenberg in Hamburg (from February 28 until September 11, 2016). It is a major retrospective of the artist's pieces and it encompasses more than six hundred artworks from every period of his career. It is also interesting to mention that the majority of pieces available at this show have never been exhibited before. Accompanying the exhibition is a brand new publication by D. Zwirner Books, made in collaboration with Pettibon. The publication is curated by Ulrich Loock and the biographical notes are written by Lucas Zwirner. After its premiere in Hamburg, the show will travel to Museum der Moderne in Salzburg.   Raymond Pettibon’s work is of crucial importance because it features a wide spectrum of American issues belonging to both high and low culture. With his humorous style full of irony, easily recognizable illustrations and strong punch lines, Pettibon has covered many universally appealing topics, such as the life of marginalized youth, art history, literature, sports, religion, politics, and of course sexuality. Pettibon remains a very active artist, eagerly following the ever changing topics and issues of the modern society and lifestyle. The artist is represented by David Zwirner London, David Zwirner 20th Street New York, and Galerie Fluegel-Roncak.  ",1947
Robert Longo,"As one of the guys who “got blamed for the 80’s”, Robert Longo creates works that bridge the gap between hyper-realistic and disturbingly surreal through the images frozen in time resembling the situations which refuse to resolve. Presumptuous and imposing, they manage to escape strict categorization as painting, sculpture or media art, merging the power of photographic and film pictures that Longo exploits as a mean of his research of importance of visual expression in popular culture and stereotypical portrayals of the individual’s alienation within a complex society. His concept explains the changing landscape and aesthetic of New York City during the 80’s due to the fast gentrification and influence of the stock market. His powerful epic narrative is the result of elevation and transformation of the medium of drawing into the painting through the use of traditional methods of processing light and dark as the primary elements. Starting from the personal and intimate, Longo has found the perfect balance with collective, reflecting contemporary surrounding and questioning the postulates of today’s life. Based on photographs, his works are essentially conceptual, but highly abstract at the same time.    Longo was born in 1953 in Brooklyn, New York. His earliest childhood was marked by his fascination with mass media, from television and movies to magazines and comic books, that continued to influence his art throughout his career. Never finished the college at the University of North Texas, he later decided to study sculpture under Leonida Finke, who motivated him to follow his artistic strivings. Receiving a grant at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence in 1972, he spent some time in Italy and upon his return, Longo received a BFA at Buffalo State College. Along with his friends, he established an avant-garde art gallery in the building of an old ice factory, that became Hallwalls Contemporary Art Center. Thanks to this space, he got an opportunity to meet many local and New York artists and decided to move to Manhattan and be a part of the underground art scene of the 70’s. Although he studied sculpture, Longo has always preferred drawing as his favorite form of creative expression. Still, his sculptural training left a trace, giving the very important third dimension to all of his artworks. Robert Longo made a breakthrough at the very beginning of his career with his series of graphite and charcoal drawings of smartly dressed men and women named Men in the Cities. Starting to work on it in 1979, these pieces were exhibited two years later at Metro Pictures Gallery in New York and marked the next 35 years of his professional life remaining fresh and current in every period of time. Inspired by the Hollywood’s stylization of violence, in part by the neo-noir cinema of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, rock star poses in music videos and probably the rise of Wall Street his characters are captured in undefined motion that makes the viewer wonder whether they are dancing or dying. The artist described them as “doomed souls. They're people who built the buildings that would eventually fall on them.” On the roof of his apartment building in lower Manhattan, Longo gathered his friends dressed in suits and photographed them in reactive moments caused by throwing objects toward them. After projecting pictures on paper, he drew over them with a great precision. Radiating youthful optimism, these artworks became a symbol of every new generation.   Processing the themes of power, authority, and patriotism, he created series of darkened, monochromatic American flags, Black Flags (1989-91), as both works on paper and bronze sculptures, folded or unbend and series of oversized guns, Bodyhammers (1993-95). Often putting in front of himself the demanding tasks, Longo worked for one year on the Magellan project (1995), drawing 366 pieces, every day per one, documenting the images that impacted his thoughts, representing his cultural and personal environment through his distinctive visual language. Seven years later, he repeated similar approach with his Freud Drawings (2002) as a reinterpretation of Edmund Engelman’s documentary of Sigmund Freud’s flat, just before his flight from the Nazis, creating, as he said, “a psychoanalysis of Freud’s apartment.” For the work Barbara and Ralph, he used projected photographs put on paper and traced with graphite. Removing all the details from the background, Longo let his assistant and long-time illustrator Diane Shea to amend the figures leaving him to provide the “cosmetic” work, making numerous adjustments before it was done a week later. Making the lithographs, Longo used to repeat this process, leaving studio assistant to do the basic preparation. During the 1980’s, Longo has very successfully directed several music videos for major hits of famous bands, such as New Order’s ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", Megadeth's ""Peace Sells"" and ""The One I Love"" by R.E.M, and was also involved in creation of the front covers of Glenn Branca's The Ascension from 1981 and The Replacements' 1985 album Tim, inspiring the other authors of similar content. His cyberpunk movie Johnny Mnemonic with Keanu Reeves in the main role and short film Arena Brains rounded the work on his numerous performances and theater pieces, such as Marble Fog or Killing Angel, in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. As the leader and guitarist of the band called Robert Longo’s Menthol Wars, he played punk and experimental music, very popular in New York clubs at the end of 1970’s.   One more time, on the occasion of his solo exhibition Strike The Sun (2014) at Petzel Gallery in New York, Longo used American national symbols putting in the limelight the United States Capitol building and the American flag. The image of Capitol is followed by 17-foot high black wax surfaced sculpture of flag that threatens to collapse and drawing of the riderless horseback that led JFK’s funeral procession. At the same time, Metro Pictures Gallery showed Gang of Cosmos, Longo’s exhibition that consisted of twelve charcoal drawings of famous Abstract Expressionists Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Helen Frankenthaler, Lee Krasner, Norman Lewis, Joan Mitchell, Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still, representing distinctive dialogue and some kind of homage to this important people who influenced his way of thinking. Studying their paintings in museums, he started from digitally manipulated photographs and through his characteristic approach created images that allow recognition of the original artwork, but still making visible details of the complex surface, the tactility of the paint, the brushstrokes and the pattern of the canvas. Exploring his own relation with painting, Longo acted with the aim of highlight the importance of Abstract Expressionism as the first movement that shifted the cultural dominance from Europe to the United States in the years after the World War II, putting it in counterpoint to the American symbols installed at Petzel gallery. His European presentation has been held in Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Paris in April 2016, when Longo reviled his large-scale charcoal drawings and sculptures within the exhibition Luminous Discontent. From the first encounter with monumental abstraction Untitled, the viewer remains deprived of determined impression, but initially disoriented, but directed on the shift of focus into his own instincts and intuition. Through the cracked ice of a massive iceberg and bullet hole in a glass window, he comes to the works based on the X-rays of paintings by van Gogh and the Old Masters. This collision of epic images illuminates the history and reflects our chaotic time of uncertainty where the belief in the unseen creates opposite forces, trust, and skepticism, hope and fear.   Processing the themes of today’s world, Longo became known for his socially relevant artworks that masterly balance between emotional and rational. “As an artist, we’re reporters. Our job is to report what it’s like to be alive now. We’re one of the few professions left in the world that has the opportunity to try to tell the truth.” Listing the number of influences, Longo mentions the New York Post, the films of Sam Peckinpati, and artists such as Sol LeWitt, Vito Acconci, Robert Smithson, Edward Hopper, and Egon Schiele, but also ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. His major retrospective exhibitions, again and again, prove his value and importance among his generation of artists. His pieces have been exhibited in numerous shows around the globe, including Musee D'Art Moderne Et D'Art Contemporain de Nice in France, Museu Colecção Berardo in Lisbon, Portugal, Albertina in Vienna, Austria, Isetan Museum of Art in Tokyo, and Museum of Contemporary art in Chicago among the others. He has participated in Documenta, the Whitney Biennial, and Venice Biennale. For more than three decades Longo has been a prominent figure in New York cultural scene, shaping the visual language through his artworks, performances, films, and videos. In 2005 he was the recipient of the prestigious Goslar Kaiser Ring in Germany for “outstanding achievements in modern art,” and in 2010, he was inducted as Officier de L'ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture.

Glenn Ligon,"It takes courage to even try to make a difference. This goes for all aspects of life, but it particularly applies to art. If you were to speak about making changes through art, one of the first names that would pop to mind is Glenn Ligon. This American artist is renowned for combining his formal art education with complexities of his personal history to create emotionally charged pieces that convey challenging messages and subcontexts. They are direct pieces as well - he uses letters and sentences (mostly quoted statements) to convey a message for the audiences.   Glenn was born in the Bronx, NY, in 1960. Being a new edition to a working-class family, his early childhood was marked by limited home budget. However, when Ligon turned 7, his divorced parents agreed that the best course of action for him and his brother was to enlist them with the Walden School, a prestigious progressive private institution in Manhattan. Paying high scholarships was not an easy feat for Glenn's parents to accomplish, but they admirably made it all work. Walden School provided Ligon the knowledge necessary to eventually get into the program of the Wesleyan University. He graduated with a B.A. in 1982 and got a job as a proofreader for a law firm. In the meantime, Glenn made a hobby for himself out of painting in an abstract expressionistic style, similar to that of Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. This way of spending spare time was a positive filter for Glenn as it allowed him to be himself without any sort of boundaries of the outside world and its stresses. What started as a relaxation therapy eventually turned into something much more important as Glenn started participating in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Program during the year of 1985. At that moment it seems as Ligon dedicated himself fully to the artistic side of his personality - it took him only four years to establish a name and hold his first solo exhibition in Brooklyn, named as How It Feels to Be Colored Me. And, surprisingly, it didn't look anything like Pollock or de Kooning. Actually, it was unlike anything before him.    The Brooklyn show in 1989 established Glenn's reputation for creating large, text-based paintings. Ligon's work at the time was greatly influenced by his experiences as an African American and a gay man living in the United States. Have in mind that Glenn did not grow into a man during the relatively liberal 21st century - he faced early life during the turbulent '80, the defining years both for the colored and homosexual people of the US. These circumstances had a toll on Gleen's artwork which is very easy to notice. His takes on the topics of slavery, civil rights and sexual politics are what drives his art from inside out. The Glenn's trademark is the incorporation of literary fragments and jokes from many authors. These quotes are directly stenciled onto the canvas by hand and often are repeated many times on one single piece. This way it seems as the same statement was repeated so many times it lost it's meaning in the process. Glenn usually quotes big figures of history - including the writings and speech of Jean Genet, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Gertrude Stein, Walt Whitman, Richard Pryor, etc. Glenn Ligon can be perceived as a conceptual artist. Throughout his long creative career, he tackled many obstacles in life - many of which all of us face during our lifetimes: race, language, desire, sexuality. Ligon's method demands that he engages in intertextuality with other works from the visual arts and literature, but with his own life experience as well. Besides painting, he also practices neon, photography, sculpture, print, installation etc. All in all, Ligon's art goes by the saying: the end justifies the means. The concept is what's important, not the way you make a point.   Ligon's art is represented in many public and private collections around the world. His work can be found in The Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago,The Museum of Modern Art in New York, in The Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Guggenheim Museum in New York, The Tate Modern in London, etc. The list can go on for quite some time. Such wide recognitions are not common for contemporary artists, especially not the living ones. Ligon was also granted numerous awards for his work and it's influences. An interesting fact - in 2009 President of the United States, Barack Obama, added Ligon's piece Black Like Me No. 2 to the White House collection on a loan deal. It was installed in the President's private living quarters. The text on this particular piece is from the 1961 memoir written by John Howard Griffin on the account of his experiences while traveling the South with his skin artificially darkened. This led to many newspaper headlines that stated Ligon is Obama's favorite artist.    Ligon’s paintings and installations deal with social identity and equality. These topics are always touchy subjects, especially when they are displayed in a way Glenn shows them. In his pieces, the accent is put on the statements - Ligon transforms his compositions using texts he quotes. His art is layered with meaning and is difficult to read, which are features also shared with his subject matters. If you're looking for subtleness and casualness, Ligon is not an artist for you. His style is full of anger, despite its obvious objectiveness. Glenn shows us that although we pride ourselves as being cultured and civilized, there is much more work ahead of us. An important lesson for all of humanity.  The artist is represented by POP FINE ART Los Angeles in California (United States).

Joe Bradley,"Working between a rich abstract language and slacker aesthetics, Joe Bradley is an American painter who emphasizes the use of as little effort and material as possible in order to depict complex expressive narratives. Because of such methods, this artist earned himself numerous comparisons with the movement of Minimalism, although Joe's approach is a lot more ironic and cynical in nature when compared to the original intentions of minimalistic painters. Another artistic style Joe is often associated with is the color field painting due to his simplistic practice of incorporating primary colors, but this also can not be completely true as Bradley has been known to depict human forms in his works - even though they are extremely disfigured and abstract.   Joe Bradley was born in Kittery, ME, in the year of 1975. He went on to receive his BFA in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design at the age of 24 and quickly skyrocketed to art world stardom thanks to his vivid, dynamic style and original aesthetics. His methods developed over the years slowly, but ever since he became popular, it seems as though his work has been sticking to similar ideas for the majority of the time. Through his art, Bradley attempts to find the perfect balance inside a triangle of Twombly-like scrabble, kitschy iconography and hard-edge geometric abstraction inspired by the old avant-garde movements. This applies to even the oldest series he ever painted - in it, Joe created anthropomorphized shaped canvases which evoke the work of Ellsworth Kelly or Blinky Palermo and resembles running figures. With this first project that was arguably Bradley's most successful and iconic one, the artist displayed an approach that was simultaneously dazzling, playful and irreverent. His later paintings depict figures resembling human forms and they have been often associated with certain aspects of color field painting and Minimalism, as was already said before. In an attempt to precisely explain his art, Bradley described his work with the words intentionally shoddy and pathetic - this is probably down to the fact Joe uses flimsy shop-bought canvases, although he appears to be putting much more attention to the choice and quality of color.    Methodically speaking, Bradley often paints flat on the floor, similar to the way Pollock used to make his own pieces. This actually allows Joe to maximize the chances of accidental marks and the picking up of materials appearing on his paintings, as well as a little bit of dirt which is always welcome - these sorts of improvisational moments make Bradley's work very untimely dynamic and unpredictable, which is exactly for what this artist goes for in his career. He regularly applies paint on one side of the canvas only to have it break through the paper and make their way to the side that will actually be displayed.  It should also be noted that Bradley has been taking his experimentation a step further than combing Minimalistic and abstract elements - he has been known to assemble uncomplicated figures from a couple of canvases with simplistic depictions similar to color field paintings. These pieces are quite interesting to observe as they do not resemble anything else present on the art scene. Another alteration from traditional paintings are the pieces in which Joe draws simple lines on found cardboards and post-its, making the artworks simple in nature and yet fascinating to look at. He also incorporates many child-like markings in his works, which fits in perfectly with the simplistic nature and emphasized improvisation of the pieces he authors. Throughout his career, Bradley found much critical and commercial success as his work was always well accepted by both the experts and the wider masses of audiences. Joe never had problems with finding representation either as he always seemed able to find his place in prestigious galleries and prominent museums in the United States - he was the focal point of numerous high-profile exhibitions, crowned with his participation in the 2014 exhibition titled The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World, a show organized by The Museum of Modern Art in New York City.  Joe Bradley may always stick to the confinements implemented in the realm of painting, but his aesthetics are far from restraints as it's formally wild and expressive to the bone. From the modularly shaped paintings paying homage to Minimalism, to the rudimental line drawings on cardboards, to the unceremoniously stitched pieces - Bradley always displayed an expressive note of originality and made sure every single piece seems to be the world on its own. Developing such a simple yet complex visual language must have been undoubtedly challenging, but luckily for the art fans around the world, Joe Bradley managed to pull it off.

Adam McEwen,"Adam McEwen is a British artist whose installations and sculptures are manipulating familiar items, re-purposing them in new, unexpected contexts. His interventions are lowering audience’s indifference to the mass media exposure present in the daily life. Adam McEwen was born in London. In 1987 he attended his BA course in English Literature at the Christ Church in Oxford. In 1991 he moved to the Valencia where he studied art at California Institute of the Arts. After writing obituaries for the Daily Telegraph in London, he began producing obituaries of living subjects thus highlighting the blurred line between history and fiction. He created morbidly humorous works that often address the celebrity-driven nature of the media and its broad impact on contemporary culture, as in his series of enlarged, wall-mounted mock-obituaries of living celebrities, like Kate Moss or Jeff Koons. As the artist has stated, “I’m interested in that brief second when you aren't sure whether Bill Clinton is alive or dead. I only need that moment in order to disorient them enough to sneak through to some other part of the brain—to achieve that split second of turning the world upside down.” This artist is also known for paintings employing wads of chewing gum on canvas that reference the bombing of German cities in the Second World War, and for machined graphite sculptures of such banal objects as a water cooler or an air conditioner. Although McEwen's text paintings situate his work in relation to artists such as Richard Prince, Ed Ruscha, and Christopher Wool, his conceptual practice links him more closely with Andy Warhol. Like Warhol, McEwen excavates our obsession with a celebrity and tabloid dominated culture. His work resides somewhere between the celebratory and funereal. For over ten years he has exhibited internationally and domestically. His presence in New York is especially extensive; he has shown at many of the city’s essential galleries and museums, including PS 1 MoMa, New Museum, Whitney Biennale, and the Guggenheim. McEwen’s studio practice also extends into written and curatorial projects. He lives and works in New York, NY.",1951
Pose,"Jordan Nickel aka POSE is Chicago-based artist known for his progressive letter style, technical precision, dedication, and legal troubles that made him a front runner of Chicago’s golden age of graffiti.  POSE is a member of The Seventh Letter, an acclaimed West Coast artist collective and Mad Society Kings (MSK), a world-renowned graffiti crew. POSE was born in 1980 in Evanston, Illinois, and began painting graffiti in 1992. He pursued academic art study at the Kansas City Art Institute and received a degree in painting 2004. In 2005, he founded We Are Supervision, with artist/photojournalist KC Ortiz, a creative agency that focuses on large-scale, hand-painted signs and billboard mural painting. POSE dabbled in the gallery world and by 2009 completely transitioned into it full time. His paintings have been in high demand ever since. His recent exhibitions at Jonathan Levine Gallery and Volta in New York and at Known Galley in Los Angeles were highly attended and sold out. While his studio work is a departure from his work on the street, it contains the energy and impact of his graffiti. Inspired by pop art, POSE uses bright colors and a tight graphic style to create intense paintings that nearly jump off the walls. He morphs illustration, lettering, screen print aesthetics, humor, and violence in every piece of artwork, giving the body of work a storybook anthology feel while each piece persists in its own narrative world. He continues to paint large-scale murals outside and has recently completed a big public arts project in Detroit and collaboration mural with artist REVOK on the famous Houston/Bowery wall in New York City. POSE is easily one of the top ten most sought after graffiti artists in the world. As a result he has been flown all over the world as a guest at many art events. He has worked on many commercial jobs with proven brands and his progression to gallery artist has been a whirlwind experience. His incredible talent and ambition make him a contemporary artist to follow and collect. POSE currently lives and works in Chicago, IL.",1952
Gary Baseman,"Recognized for his talent to use a cartoonish visual style to present the viewers with frightening and provocative content, Gary Baseman is an American contemporary artist who works with a wide range of different mediums. He possesses a strong artistic mastery over illustration, fine art, performance art, design and animation. Baseman’s unique aesthetic blends aspects of iconic Pop art images, vintage motifs, cross-cultural mythology, literary archetypes and psychological models, all underlined by a cartoonish visual vocabulary. The last serves the role of a trademark as the playful, devious and cleverly named creatures are an instant giveaway that you are looking at a Gary Baseman artwork.  Gary Baseman was born in the metropolis of Los Angeles in the year of 1960 and was raised in the city’s Fairfax district. He was the fourth child of Holocaust survivors who were originally from Poland - his father was an electrician and mother was an employee of Canter’s Deli. For as far back as he can remember, Baseman was inspired by Warner Bros. cartoons, MAD Mag and Disneyland and these creative resources still play a major part of Gary's creations to this day. Another strong influence to the young Gary were his two close friends that are still a big part of his life today - Barry Smolin, who is now a radio host and musician, and Seth Kurland, a writer and TV producer. Baseman studied communications at UCLA. After graduation, the author started dedicating all his efforts towards establishing what he calls pervasive art - an alternative to the lowbrow art label.[1] From that point on, Gary was using that term to didactically describe the broad shift in his and others’ work to more visible avenues of art-making. The ultimate goal of pervasive art was to blur the lines between fine art and commercial art; it also allowed the artist to take on any medium and it did not bind him or her to any one world, whether that is the gallery world, editorial world or art toy world.  Gary established himself as the leading international artist during the time between the years of 1986 and 1996 when he worked as an illustrator in New York. He became an in-demand artist with a unique visual sense and the ability to generate sharp, witty messages. In fact, Baseman refers to his illustration work, and to his general process for that matter, as message-making and this is really important to understand when analyzing any of this artist's works regardless of their type. After proving himself as the leading illustrator, Gary Baseman expanded his practices to performance art, fine art and design whilst he maintained his unique, subtle and dark style.[2]   Baseman's illustrations and other artworks have appeared in numerous publications including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic Monthly, The New Yorker and Rolling Stone. Furthermore, he has had major independent and corporate clients such as AT&T Corporation, Gatorade, Nike, Inc. and Mercedes-Benz. Besides his artistic practices, Gary is also the creator of the Emmy-winning ABC/Disney cartoon series titled as Teacher's Pet and the artistic designer of Cranium, a popular award-winning board game.    Gary's ability to combine different visual and emotional tones is virtually unrivaled by any contemporary author. Baseman successfully references cartoon imagery and children’s books whilst blending the content with a much darker, moodier themes that introduce wide-eyed devils, nymphs, skeletons and beasts. Surprisingly, this kind of contrast works phenomenally and it truly has a remarkable effect on the viewers. It will cause an instant joy and a sense of nostalgia within the audience before making them aware of the fact that the entire piece has a much grimmer meaning hidden behind the bright colors and carefree atmosphere.

Eddie Martinez,"Often inspired by pop culture, the motifs and characters in Eddie Martinez’s work usually include humans and animals with big staring eyes, clowns, skulls and cartoonish ducks. Less serious, but more humorous images enchant with their bright colors and simple forms. The only seriousness in the present is background philosophy revealed trough relationship and communication between his subjects. Influenced by classical tradition of still-life, allegorical narratives and portraits, especially by De Kooning’s art, his expression is processed with simplified and rough brushstrokes, bold contours and semi-abstraction.    Martinez was always interested in art and for the first time his potential and talent was displayed during the house painting job when he was scribbling over the painted walls. Basically self-taught as a painter, he has left two art schools in Boston and stayed with very little formal education. He uses classical techniques, as the oil and acrylic paint, but he often incorporates some different and unusual media, like pencils, pen, paper, markers and spray paint, even gum wrappers, paper towels and baby wipes, reflecting the urban chaos of the world around. Joining together his personal creativity and urban culture with modern masters’ expression, Martinez reveals remarkably strong visual language. Drawing his inspiration from a wide-range of sources, he involves major art historical movements of the 20th century, as Abstract Expressionism, Neo Expressionism and CoBrA.    His recent investigations have taken him to the world of sculpture, made from different and strange materials, as rubber hose pipes, Styrofoam, cardboard or metal scraps. These three-dimensional art pieces are the part of his exhibition Nomander whose title refers to his childhood when his family moved frequently and he was often losing his belongings. His memories influenced on the materiality and his dimensional expression and revealed his strivings to push the work behind his boundaries. This works show the constant evolution in Martinez's practice.     Eddie Martinez’s solo premiere has been held at ZieherSmith Gallery in New York in 2006, and before and after that his work was exhibited in numerous group shows. His paintings have been shown around the world and are owned by different institutions as the Macro Future Museum of Contemporary art in Rome. He has been a resident at Bauernmarkt, Lenikus Collection, Vienna, 2008 and was awarded First Place, Best Group Show in a Commercial Gallery for the Boston-area, by the International Association of Art Critics (AICA) Awards in 2007.   Martinez’s work offers sincere optimism with the simple mixture of abstraction and figuration. With their internal logic, these paintings are the testimony of the way the artist sees the world. The color manipulation is the main characteristic of his work. Contrast combination of vivid colors is aggressively applied to the canvas. Blending splatters of oil paint with traces of marker he creates a messy surface with figures and shapes rarely situated in any perceivable scenery. Today, his work is recognizable for his bright colored cartoonish figures similar to graffiti design. Emitting the powerful energy, unknown and familiar forms coexist on the canvas emphasized with vivid colors and expressive lines.   All images courtesy of the artist",1954
Kazuo Shiraga,"Although he was famous for many aspects of his life and work, Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga was primarily recognized for his performative painting practices. His particularly unorthodox set of techniques was underlined by Shiraga's style which was heavily influenced by the dominant American Expressionism movement. Kazuo was a pivotal part of the artistic group called Gutai, an organization which spurred an avant-garde creative current based on an idea of having action and everyday life translated into dynamic artworks[1]. Although it is fairly common to hear comparisons between Jackson Pollock’s drip method and this Japanise's own technique, Kazuo Shiraga had a practice that required more enhanced textures and general thickness of the piece.   Kazuo Shiraga was born during the year of 1924, in the town of Amagasaki, an industrial city located in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. He was brought up by a kimono merchant family, a situation which placed the young boy in a very traditional setting. Shiraga soaked in the beauty of kimonos which can arguably be described as his earliest influence. Another influence came from his parents as Kazuo’s father was interested in oil painting and was always eager to show his son some techniques or explain artistic concepts[2]. During the year of 1938, Shiraga enrolled in Yōga classes which followed the Western conventions and techniques whilst staying true to the core of Japanise painting practices. Four years later, ambitious Kazuo began his artistic education at the Kyoto City University of Arts. Just before graduating, the author married Fujiko Uemura. Shiraga majored in Traditional Painting (Nihon-ga) in 1948 and continued his artistic training with Ito Tsuguro, a famous local painter. These were the early pivotal times of Kazuo's development. In 1951, the young artist visited the Yomiuri Independent Exhibition where he had the opportunity to view the works of Jackson Pollock. Inspired by the American artist, Shiraga started exploring the drip technique, a venture that led him to an opportunity to meet Jirō Yoshihara.    Shiraga's new friend Jirō Yoshihara was a well-known Japanese painter who established Gutai Association in 1954. Naturally, he included his close friend and colleague in this organization. Gutai was a radical post-war association of artists primarily focused on attaining genuine originality and innovation in artworks. Kazuo became one of the leading individuals of Gutai, adding that to his list of activities as Shiraga was already a member of Zero Kai Group, a collective based on the belief that artworks should be created out of nothing. In both groups, Shiraga presented his pieces made by no tools, only using his bare hands.[3] It has been noted that this author produced his first painting without a brush in the year of 1953. The following year, Kazuo extended his arsenal of tools by introducing pieces made strictly by his bare feet. In 1955. Shiraga created his most famous piece, called The Challenging Mud. He used nothing but his own body, turning and writhing in a pile of mud, recording the entire process of making in order to turn his method into a variant of performance art[4].   Shiraga’s career reached its undeniable peak in the mid-50s, lasting all the way throughout the 60s. In 1957, the French curator and collector Michel Tapié heard about his works and met with Jirō Yoshihara, through whom he became acquainted with Kazuo’s art. Tapié and Kazuo concluded a contract and his paintings broke into the European market in 1958, although he was never too popular with anyone outside Japan during his life. Interestingly, the author started signing his pieces in kanji, as well as naming his pieces after the famed Suikoden warriors. Following one incredible national success after another, Kazuo abandoned painting completely in 1971 when he discovered a spiritual path in Enryaku-Ji, a Tendai Buddhist monastery located deep in the wilderness of Hiei Mountain, near Kyoto. This monkhood lasted for a while, but following the sudden death of Jirō Yoshihara, Shiraga returned to art-making and started exploring different styles and mediums. He did stay true to his original techniques, however, as the brush never substituted his hands, fingers and feet.[5] To the last day of his life, Kazuo remained popular in Japan as he never managed to establish himself as a household name in Europe or in the United States. Shiraga died on April 8, 2008, in his hometown of Amagasaki. Due to the versatility and innovative nature of his art, the interest in Shiraga never started to fade as the decades were passing by. Naturally, many publications concerning the subject of Kazuo's art have appeared oveer the course of the artist's long career - arguably offering the best analysis and insights into Shiraga's art are the two books titled Kazuo Shiraga and Body and Matter: Kazuo Shiraga.   As far as Kazuo Shiraga was concerned, a painting was defined by the gestures of its creation. He would suspend himself over the canvas, use his own blood as a material, create marks with nothing but his toes - resulting in a totally unique way of shaping the painterly composition. He would stop at nothing in order to achieve the perfect painting, using the entirety of his body as a mere tool. Ultimately, this is regarded as Shiraga's greatest contribution to art history. Such dedication is hard to find as only a handful of authors over the course of centuries was prepared to sacrifice so much in order to make their artworks more complete. And at the core of such a method was a highly theoretical concept, adequately put into words by the author himself: I want to make paintings as slippery and as uncatchable as a sea cucumber, pieces with no center what so ever.

Nanda Vigo,"Nanda Vigo was an Italian artist born in 1936. She was considered a pioneer in modern Italian art, who continually skirted the confines of design, architecture and installation to compelling effect, in her own practice, but also collaborated with other artists such as Lucio Fontana and Giò Ponti. Her oeuvre ranges from mind-bending interiors and enigmatic light sculptures to futuristic cemetery designs. Her more recent designs stemmed from this exploration, focusing on sensory impulses through materials such as glass, mirrors, and neon lights. Nanda started her own atelier in Milan in 1959, and soon after began exhibiting her works throughout Europe. Nanda Vigo was one of the pre-eminent names in the history of contemporary Italian art. Ever since the 1960s, following a constantly evolving process a world away from stereotypes and brand names, the exemplary nature of her work has inspired a generation of artists and designers. Rather than systematically repeating successful formulas, she always pursued the path of experimentation and exploration of the new: performance, installations and happenings are integral to her artistic language, existing in parallel with the practice of architecture, which naturally led her to design. The singularity of her art celebrates her work on space, which incorporates the immaterial play of light and reflections in her works. The Chronotops, the first examples of, which date back to the early 60s, constitute the first evidence of her research. Structures of fluted glass and aluminum that capture and release through their transparency the most intense impressions of light, the Chronotops correspond to a principle of diffraction and reflection that owes more to the perception of sensory energies than to a material reality. “The definition of the Chronotop” said Nanda, “is destined to express a philosophy rather than a language of forms, even if it alludes to them. The form in this case only serves to give an informative impetus to the philosophy enabling the latter to draw the conclusion of the continuous and complete understanding of man beyond the form.” Nanda Vigo’s artistic adventure began in Milan in late 1958 and early 1959. She initially worked closely with Giò Ponti and Lucio Fontana, mentors who teach her the art of space and light in a conceptual and emotional style that will inspire her to define her own artistic philosophy. She also frequented the mythical Brera quarter, which was then the setting for all the events and discussions held by the most anti-establishment and radical artists of the time. It is here that Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni, Gianni Colombo, Enrico Castellani and Vincenzo Agnetti met, along with so many others who constitute at the time a select group of people determined to promote their new vision of the world. This is where, in 1959, Nanda Vigo met Piero Manzoni. A relationship between passion and competition is born which will last until the latter’s death in 1963. These are years rich in exchanges, and define a particular moment in history between Milan, around the Azimuth group established by Castellani, Agnetti and Manzoni, Düsseldorf’s Zero group and the New Realists in Paris. Firm beliefs and natural affinity led Nanda Vigo to ally herself to the Zero group, whose basic “Cosmic Power” principle she adopted, preferring as she did to explore rather than to analyse, to be inspired by philosophical theories rather than by aesthetic doctrines she never followed. Nanda Vigo always asserted her unconditional freedom to create away from trends, schools and fashions, she remained convinced that authentic art is capable of inspiring society’s future form. She exhibited throughout the world with the Zero group, and was featured in multiple iterations of the Triennale di Milano, as well as the Venice Biennale in 1982.The importance of her work remains self-evident.",1956
Ozmo,"In order to process certain subject of interest Ozmo aka Gionata Gesi does not focus on working with any particular media. It is his desire to express certain observations and emotions that are affecting the production of different works. The way Ozmo is combining painterly elements like figures, shapes, colors and the way the composition is being constructed suggest how thorough is the artist's approach. References from popular culture, art history, and politics that are wisely appropriated contribute largely to both seriousness and humor of his works, as well as to their contemporaneity.  Gionata Gesi aka Ozmo is an Italian artist born in Pontedera, Pisa, in 1975. He started off by drawing comics in the early 90s but has soon changed his field of interest to writing and painting. Soon afterward, his tag became one of the most famous and respected ones in the Italian graffiti scene. After Ozmo finished the Fine Arts Academy of Florence in 2001, he moved to Milano. The underground scene of graffiti artist grew on him, so together with his friends decided to lay foundations of Italian Street Art. His career started to rise step by step and over the course of time he painted and showcased his artworks in New York, Miami, Chicago, London, Berlin, Sao Paolo, Habana, Beirut and Gdansk, among others.   Ozmo started documenting Italian street art by making photos and comments and collected all the material and decided to publish the book under the title Milan, an alternative guide. At the opening of his first solo show at Galleria Astuni, the book was promoted. That provided additional attention from both art circles and the media and Ozmo started exhibiting at the Italian art fair circuit and showcased in the main galleries of Milan. On that trail, the artist started painting monumental walls in alternative spaces and social centers. That is how mural at social center Leoncavallo came to life.   The works of Ozmo can be read as some form of metaphors or perhaps riddles since he is working with religious icons, various symbols, numbers, tarots or chess and often refers to philosophy. Whether the color pallet is bright and cheerful or simplified and somehow dark, Ozmo masterfully disposes of it depending on the theme or the composition in general. Actually, the whole process of working on a wall or any other two-dimensional surface is well thought and predetermined by a serious research.   After a special reportage by the most famous urban culture underground mag in Italy, which was dedicated to his achievements, Ozmo became known as one of the leading figures in the underground scene in national context. That was followed by his name being published in the famous magazine Flash Art within I nuovissimi Top 100 dopo Cattelan – The newest Top 100 after Cattelan list in 2006 and in the Dizionario della Giovane Arte Italiana – Young Italian Art Dictionary in 2008. The thin line between fine arts and graffiti’s seems to be erased in the case of Ozmo not just because of his engagement and recognition by both institutional and underground frame, but rather because of his authentic iconography and subtly socially engaged practice.

Ernesto Neto,"Through his characteristic visual language, Ernesto Neto starts from the idea of interaction and sensory experience, including the audience in his large experimental environments that engage all the senses and questioning the viewer’s perception. Taking from the minimalist sculptural practice, Brazilian Neo Concretism, Biomorphic architecture, and related local avant-garde movements, Neto chooses unusual materials, merging the external and internal structures and making the clear contrast between organic and artificial. His installations offer the escape from the everyday world, providing an opportunity to take a break and slow down through the delicate experience that overcomes all the senses.  Neto was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1964 where he graduated from the School of Visual Arts of Parque Lage (1994-1997) and attended the Sao Paulo Museum of Modern Art from 1994 to 1996. Since then, he produced an influential body of work, exploring the elements of collective space and the natural world by engaging and implementing the physical interaction and sensuous experience. Influenced by the duality of the city he lives in, his artworks represent the same combination of nature and artificial urban constructions, revealing not only the visual delicacy but impressive adventure for all senses. Neto succeeded the generation of Brazilian artists known as Neo Concretists that took a part in the liberation of artistic approach during the 1960’s and 1970’s, changing the viewer’s position in regard to artwork by making him the active part and the one who control the artistic process. He adopted their propositions that became the guide for his development[1]. Making the site-specific sculptural installations, his pieces are characteristic for the use of uncommon materials, often transparent with strange textures. Intertwined nets and cocoons, inwrought with nylon carry unexpected things like candies, sand or colorful Styrofoam balls that fill out nets, forming hanging shapes that fall like drops from the ceiling. With the aim of being experienced, these works beg to be touched. His first appearance in front of the home audience occurred in 1988 at Petite Galerie in Rio de Janeiro and international debut in 1996 in Chicago and the same year in Madrid. A few years later, the visitors of the 49th Venice Biennale were fascinated by his installation Ô Bicho! in which they could wander among nylon stalactites filled with pepper, cloves, and turmeric, simultaneously hypnotizing their visual and sense of smell. Another “aromatic monster” appeared in Paris’ Pantheon in 2006 where his monumental sculpture Léviathan Thot occupied the space between the floor and the domed ceiling. His largest work until that moment was shown in 2010, at the Hayward Gallery in London, representing the embodiment of four million microorganisms inside the human body.   Using the crocheting that he learned from his grandmother, Neto stretches the sewed flows to its boundaries, knitting the web successively, by intuition. Asking the viewer to slow down, walk carefully and feel the surroundings, his installations influence on people to notice their own body and its respond to different spaces. For Bicho SusPenso na PaisaGen (2012), placed at Leopoldina Station in Rio de Janeiro, the artist created colorful crocheted net spread through entire expanse with transparent passages that float above the floor, leading the visitors into the smaller rooms made of Styrofoam filled bags that one can stand on top of. His Bicho (Beast) represents unpredictable creature with the animal characteristics. Not burdening his contents with additional meaningful explanations, Neto leaves them available for interaction and individual experience striving to create not only simple adult playgrounds but an idea of adventure felt in a moment.   Following the tradition of Brazilian Modernism that advocates the idea of viewer’s presence and active participation, Neto’s installation Boa, placed at Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma in Helsinki, from March until September 2016, again gives the opportunity to escape from the stress of everyday life by devoting some time to senses. This time, the artist was inspired by tradition and rituals of Huni Kuin, the indigenous tribe from the Amazon rainforest who truly believe in binding with nature and other living things. Borrowing the shape of the head of a boa constrictor, his new installation contains the same essence as the previous with an additional view on respect of the cultural differences[2].     Neto’s work has been the subject of major exhibitions worldwide. In 2011, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey in Mexico opened the artist’s first survey exhibition, La lengua de Ernesto: retrospectiva 1987-2011, which traveled to Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City in 2013. The artist also presented important solo exhibitions at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas (2012), Faena Arts Center in Buenos Aires, which traveled to Estação Leopoldina in Rio de Janeiro (2011-2012), Hayward Gallery, Southbank Centre in London (2010) Museum of Modern Art in New York (2010), Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo (2010), Sao Paulo Museum of Modern Art (2010), Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Roma in Italy (2008), Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, Australia (2002), and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (2002), among others. In 2001, he represented Brazil at the 49th and 51st Venice Biennale[3]. His work has also been featured in numerous group exhibitions and biennials, most recently the Sharjah Biennial 11, curated by Yuko Hasegawa in the United Arab Emirates (2013), along with 2013 group shows at the Denver Art Museum, Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt, and Casa de Vidro Lina Bo Bardi in São Paulo as part of The Insides Are on the Outside, curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist. His work is held in international collections, including those of the MoMA in New York, Tate Gallery in London, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam, Centre Pompidou in Paris, Hara Museum in Tokyo, Contemporary Art Center of Inhotim in Brazil, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., Milwaukee Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, among many others[4].

Itzchak Tarkay,"Israeli artist Itzchak Tarkay is known for his rich figurative oeuvre brimming with bright colors. He primarily worked with watercolors, acrylic and often employed silkscreen technique. The artist drew inspiration from Post-Impressionism and French Impressionism masters, particularly the drawing style of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and the color pallet of Henri Matisse. As a foremost representative of the new generation of figurative artists, his work possesses the visual poetry of his signature intimate setting and cafes. His work has been exhibited all around the world, including France, Israel, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States. The artist featured in numerous publications, including Itzchak Tarkay: The Park West Paintings” (1994), Tel Aviv Retrospective” (2012), and TARKAY: Intimate Moments, an Exhibition at Park West Gallery” (1991).     Itzchak Tarkay, born in 1935 in Subotica, a city located on the Yugoslav-Hungarian border, was sent to a concentration camp Mauthausen-Gusen. After Allied forces liberated the camp, he returned with his family to Subotica. They immigrated to Israel in 1949, and two years later, Tarkay enrolled at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, where he received education from artist Yosef Schwartzman. After serving in the Israeli Army, he enrolled at the Avni Institute of Art and Design. He learned from renowned artists, such as Avigdor Stematsky, Moshe Mokady, Yehezkel Streichman, and Marcel Janco. When asked about his technique, Tarkay said he works mostly instinctively and draws inspiration from his surrounding, from nature to the music he listens to. The artist could not explain his technique which he finds comes naturally the same way everybody has particular handwriting.   Tarkay was a master graphic artist who never intentionally chose colors. They came spontaneously, and he could never explain why he chose them. In his serigraphs, he applied several layers of different colors, thus creating texture and transparency. Tarkay said: However, he often had trouble realizing when the work was done. Often even several months after the exhibition, he would have an almost uncontrollable urge to re-touch each piece. Yet he never painted in order to make a point or send a message. Thus his artworks which were created for the sake of painting, are without modern trappings of site-specific sculpture or mixed-media installations.   Tarkay participated in the International Art Expo in New York in 1986 and 1987. In his early years, the artist personally finished all his paintings; however, later, he would just make a drawing, and the helping artists on staff would finish the coloring. Tarkay was also a mentor to several renowned Israeli artists, including Mark Kanovich, David Najar, and Yuval Wolfson. He was the only artist invited to collaborate with the Yaacov Agam, an Israeli experimental artist. On June 3, 2012, Tarkay died at the age of 77. Featured image: Itzchak Tarkay - Red Hat, 2000.

Vija Celmins,"Considered to be one of the most significant Latvian-American artists to date, Vija Celmins is a visual artist best known for her photo-realistic paintings and drawings of natural environments. Due to her long-held fascination with phenomena such as the ocean, spider webs, star fields, clouded sky and rocks, Vija dedicated both her life and career to depicting such wonders in an unconventional way. This New York City-based painter became renowned in artistic circles mostly due to her ability to create drawings with such fine detail that they seem to be the actual old-school photographies themselves instead just being elaborate copies. In that regard, no one is able to come even close and rival the talented hand Celmins displayed over the years.  Vija Celmins was born on the 25th of October in the year of 1938, in the city of Riga, Latvia’s capital. During the years that eventually proved to be an introduction to the bloodiest conflict in human history, Celmins fled to Germany in her parents' hands. Not aware of the extreme radicality nazi government was about to install, the young girl and her family were forced to survive the refugee-despising regime. They lived in a United Nations refugee camp in Esslingen am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg, staying there until the end of World War II. During the year of 1948, the Church World Service relocated the family to the United States, at first in New York City, then in Indianapolis. Through this rather unfortunate turn of events, ten-year-old Celmins found herself in a foreign country without knowing more than a few words of English[1]. Forced to face such isolation early on in her life, Vija turned to drawing as a mean of escape from reality. Pushed by her professors down the road of painting, she eventually started attending classes at the prestigious John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis where she blossomed as aa painter. It was during her college days that Celmins started to explore the works of the Italian monotone still-life painter Giorgio Morandi - this pushed her down the road of controlled abstraction. After she earned her BFA in 1962, Vija moved to Venice, Los Angeles, where she lived for the next twenty years, spending most of her time painting or sculpting.  Operating in California during the 1960s, Vija Celmins' early work was starting to shape itself into a fantastic photorealistic painting practice. At first, she recreated commonplace objects such as TVs, lamps, pencils and erasers, but eventually started painting monochrome reproductions of photographs. Vija mostly focused on war themes in this period of her career, depicting images of conflict such as depictions of handguns and warplanes. During the late 1960s through the 1970s, Celmins completely abandoned traditional painting in order to dedicate herself to graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings based on photographs of natural elements. Vija started presenting scenes of the moon's surface, sky, ocean, the insides of shells and closeups of rocks[2]. The incentive guide which Giorgio Morandi provided her was more than obvious as he is widely considered to be the uncrowned king of the pale gray still life. Suddenly, a visit to the New York museum was highlighted by Vija's desert surface works. As the 1970s were passing by, Celmins also started sculpting a lot more than in earlier periods of her life. She produced numerous series of bronze cast and acrylic painted stones. By 1981, she abandoned the pencil completely and returned to painting, as well as producing a large number of prints.    Now that she was active for over sixty years, observing Celmins' career as a whole is a new awe-inspiring challenge. She was active in so many fields and mediums, produced countless pieces of art and was a crucial member of artistic circles for decades - for those reasons, analyzing Vija's career is an almost insurmountable feat. Interestingly, the only consistent aspect of her work was the medium in which she was never active - photography. Never before her was a person who spent so much time exploring and investigating photos without actually utilizing them as Celmins did during her life. And in all probability, there never will be again. This artist is represented by Kunzt.gallery.  References:   ",1960
Andres Serrano,"Andres Serrano is an American photographer born in 1950, whose work has been labeled from blasphemous to beautiful. He became notorious through his photos of corpses and his use of feces and bodily fluids. The impact of Serrano’s work is often derived from the contrast between its surface beauty and disturbing subject matter, presenting the ordinary in extraordinary ways. Born in New York, Serrano is of a mixed racial background. His mother was raised in Cuba and his father was born in Honduras. Andres was raised in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in a Catholic household, and found his creative place at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, which he studied from 1967 to 1969. Although Serrano studied painting and sculpture, he was drawn to the medium of photography and the impulse to use a camera and film in the same manner that a painter uses brush and pigment. Working in large-scale format, Serrano creates psychologically charged and vibrant portraits, whose subject of matter are often visual traditions of the Catholic Church, represented in Surrealist style. Serrano’s other subjects are equally thought-provoking, like butchered animals, New York’s homeless, members of the Ku Klux Klan, bodies found on the coroner’s slab in the morgue, or the infinite variations on human sexuality. For his series of images called Nomads, Andres went into the New York City Subway with lights and photographic background paper to portray the bedraggled homeless. His artistic response to the 9/11 tragedy was to create a series of 100 portraits of citizens who embody the spirit of America. Ordinary citizens of diverse occupations and from all walks of life are shot against painted backgrounds, making astonishingly direct and honest portraits of real people representing both themselves and their humanity. For this eccentric artist, the primary function of art is to provoke immediate and powerful responses. The most famous and notorious of Serrano's work plays on the relationship between beautiful imagery and vulgar materials, his subject matter often drawing from the potentially controversial and the willfully provocative. Many of Serrano's pictures involve bodily fluids in some way—depicting, for example, blood, semen or human female milk. Within this series are a number of works in which objects are submerged in bodily fluids. Most famous of these is Piss Christ made in 1987, a luminous photograph of a crucifix submerged in the artist's own urine. Causing great controversy when first exhibited, this work became a polarizing symbol, igniting a nation-wide debate on artistic freedom and expression. The work was sold for $277,000 in 1999, far beyond the estimated $20,000 – $30,000. Andres Serrano has held over 100 solo exhibitions in galleries and museums from Iceland to Australia. His photographic works are in the permanent collections of museums in eight countries, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the National Gallery of Australia, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Amsterdam, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. The artist lives and works in New York City.",1961
Alex Prager,"American photographer and filmmaker Alex Prager has captured the public's eye with her film-like photographs. Taking inspiration straight from old Hollywood movies, Prager stages her sets and takes cinematic images that possess a strong narrative. Rich in costumes, with exaggerated emotions, the artist’s photographs speak to the ambiguity of seduction and spectacle. Over time the Prager has started making movies, and in 2011 she directed video series titled Touch of Evil, for which she won an Emmy.   Alex Prager (1979) is a self-taught photographer that fell in love with the medium after visiting William Eggleston's exhibition at the Getty Museum in 1999. Inspired by Eggleston's talent to take something that looked completely mundane and transform it into a snapshot bursting with life, the artist decided to take up photography. Just six months later, she had her first solo exhibition. Critics often describe Prager’s work as a blending of the influences by Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Douglas Sirk, and Cindy Sherman. Prager’s photographs are well thought out and planned in advance. Whether they are taken outside or in a studio, she employs trained actors, stages the setting, and meticulously pics every colorful costume. The result is a snapshot that looks like it came from a movie directed by the masters of cinema, such as David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock, as well as photographs of Gregory Crewdson and Cindy Sherman.   After the exhibition titled Polyester in 2007, Prager started getting noticed. The photographic portraits of striking women and girls were done in the aesthetic of Southern California's cinematic background. However, the transition to movie making happened in 2008 after the exhibition The Big Valley in London. During the exhibition several visitors inquired what happened before and after the photos were taken. The photographs possessed such a powerful narrative, thanks to the movie-like staging of the shots. These questions, that Prager could not answer, led to the creation of her first short film titled Despair. In 2012 the artist simultaneously created the series of photographs titled Compulsion and the short film La Petite Mort, narrated by Gary Oldman and starring Judith Godreche.   In 2011, Prager was commissioned by The New York Times Magazine to create 12 short films titled Touch of Evil featuring stand-out film actors of the year, including Brad Pitt, Viola Davis, and Gary Oldman. Each one, lasting 1 minute, was inspired by notorious villains from cinema. Throughout her career, Prague has shown a continuous love for all things melodramatic. For the artist, it is a perfect tool that adds a sense of comedy to the real emotion. Today, Prager’s artwork can be found in various collections around the world, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Elgiz Museum of Contemporary Art in Istanbul, and The Museum of Modern Art in New York. Alex Prager lives and works in Los Angeles.  ",1962
Per Kirkeby,"Abstraction is a powerful feature in the artist's dictionary. This way of expressing was established during the first half of the 20th century and is a phenomenon that marked art history. The work of Per Kirkeby is in many ways that of an abstraction - his works are extremely expressionistic, done very impulsively and have very little to no form. But to call Per's art an abstraction is a bit of a mistake, cause that limits his work that should not be confined to any one style - during his long career, he experimented with many different creative principles. Kirkeby is one of the most influential artists of modern art and is Scandinavia’s most highly acclaimed living artist.   If we were to explain what Per does in one short sentence, it would be that Kirkeby is a painter, sculptor and printmaker. But that is only the basis of his work - Per also has massive experience in drawings, films and books. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Kirby was born in pre-war Copenhagen during the year of 1938. Since his early childhood he was attracted by precise sciences and mathematics, and by the time he grew to teenage years, Per decided he would become a geologist. Per applied and enrolled at The University of Copenhagen, eventually graduating with a master's degree in geology during the 1964. Before starting his art career, Per was involved in geological work in Greenland, but in 1972 he decided to turn the page of his life on the artistic chapter. Since Kirkeby was originally trained as a geologist, he brought with himself into the art world a vast knowledge natural phenomena's, landscapes and biological forms - all this served as the basis of his visual lexicon. We also must take into the account that Kirkeby is a well-traveled artist - he was a part of expeditions in places such as Central Asia, Iceland, Central America, and the Mediterranean. All this can be evidenced in his artwork. After only two years of creative attempts, Kirkeby managed to hold his first exhibition at the Michael Werner Gallery, in Cologne, Germany. This time spent in Germany is probably the most influential trip Per ever went on - it was here he met the wild works of Caspar David Friedrich and started painting still-life compositions.    Before facing the Casper's romanticism, Per was, by his own acclaim, influenced by the Pop art of the 1960s, as well as Tachism and Abstract Expressionism. This wide variety of inspirations are visible in the vigorous brushwork and chromatic beauty of his, mostly untitled, paintings and the sensuous modelling of his rough black bronzes, that actually have earned him the title lyric expressionist. Since the day one, Per's paintings have tended towards the abstract. What we can identify in most his works with certainty are landscapes and female figures - the rest is open for discussion. Throughout his career, Kirkeby used a vast range of different media. Best known for his oil paintings, drawings, and prints, dense textures of his images' surfaces mimic the geological forms he studied at he Copenhagen University. When compared to the poetic and dramatic character of the paintings, Per's sculptors are full of unusual clarity. They make strong reference to traditional Danish housing systems, as well as Mayan architecture - probably connected somehow to the science he chose to study. His tendency to experiment and his love for conceptual painting and sculpting led him to execute a series of works unlike anything the public has ever seen, and he published poetry, essays and travel books on regular note. He also made quite a few successful television and full-length documentary films. Per wrote a couple of artists diaries and guides, such as the ‘picture novel' Landskaberne (‘Landscapes'; Copenhagen, 1969).     From 1978 to 1989, Kirkeby taught at the Karlsruhe Academy of Fine Arts and then went to teach at the Städelschule academy, in Frankfurt, Germany, until 2000. Kirkeby has received a number of awards, such as the Herbert-Boeckl-Preis (2003), for his lifework, the Coutts Contemporary Art Foundation Award(1996), and the Henrik-Steffens-Award 1996. Over the years, Kirkeby has been involved in numerous exhibitions in diverse places all over the world. Some of his exhibitions include those at the Royal Museum of Fine Art, in Copenhagen, Denmark (1975), Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (1982), Michael Werner London, in England (2008), and Julius Werner, in Berlin, Germany (2009). Many public collections hold Kirkeby's works all over the world, in diverse places such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, NY, the Tate Gallery, in London, England, and the Centre Pompidou, in Paris, France. Kirkeby is represented by prestigious museums around the world including Stedelijk Museum, in Eindhoven, Netherlands, Tate Gallery, in London, England, and Ludwig Museum, in Cologne, Germany. Not many artists can pride themselves with such representation, especially not the ones that still live. In a sense, Per Kirkeby is a living legend.    Equally trained as a geologist and an artist, Kirkeby is an artist of eminent sensuality, creating richly layered canvases filled with prodigious detail and animated by an unequaled material quality of color. He is not only a leading painter, sculptor, and printmaker, but also a prolific writer, poet, and filmmaker. Such vast experience is only matched by the successes he had in those fields of work - Per was not only involved in a verity of things, but he actually reestablished many of them from ground up. Abstract painting and sculpting, printmaking and experimental documentary films probably wouldn't be the same if we weren't as lucky to have Per Kirkeby. But fortunately for the art scene, that was not the case - Per was and still is one of the most defining artists of our time. The artist is represented by Michael Werner Gallery in London, England.

A.R. Penck,"Widely recognized for his language of reduced figures and simplified symbols, A.R. Penck was a German artist whose career spanned over six decades. Fond of concepts emerging from the primitive and Art Brut styles, A.R. Penck developed his unique pictorial and sculptural techniques after he rejected the terms of art academies in Berlin during the 1950s. In a way, his visual vocabulary can also be interpreted as a response to social and political control within the mid-20th-century art and culture. With his art, A.R. Penck attempted to give an ordinary man a voice within the numbing collective[1]. It should also be noted that this artist's real name is Ralf Winkler - he changed it to Albrecht Penck to evade East German authorities during his younger life.   Ralf Winker was born in Dresden, Germany, during the year of 1939. He studied arts together with a group of other painters in his hometown and Ralf quickly became one of the foremost exponents of the new figuration style alongside Jörg Immendorff, Georg Baselitz and Markus Lüpertz. As they were developing and maturing under a harsh Eastern German communist regime, Winker and his colleagues were seen as dissidents by the authorities and were watched by the secret police. Nonetheless, Ralf and his friends managed to exhibit their work via pseudonyms and smuggling - they were included in many shows in West Berlin during the 1970s and were seen as exponents of free speech in the Eastern Germany. Their work was included in a number of important shows including the famous Zeitgeist exhibition in the well-known Martin Gropius Bau museum and the important New Art show at the Tate in 1983. He was featured in a few New York exhibitions as well. By that time, the artist already adopted his pseudonym inspired by the work of the geologist Albrecht Penck. Soon, A.R. Penck was enjoying a worldwide attention for his paintings with pictographic, primitivist imagery of human forms and other totemic designs.   A.R. Penck's paintings are influenced by Paul Klee's work and were a mix of the flatness of Egyptian writing and the crudity of the late black paintings by Jackson Pollock. On the other hand, A.R. Penck's sculptures, although a lot less familiar, evoke the same primitive themes as his paintings and drawings.[2] In order to make them, the artist relied on everyday objects and materials such as wood, bottles, cardboard boxes, tin cans, masking tape, tinfoil and wire, all crudely painted and assembled. These features were responsible for regular connections between Ralf and the early avant-garde works, such as the readymades of the famed Marcel Duchamp. Despite their anti-art aesthetic and the questionable quality of construction, A.R. Penck's sculptures were quite similar to his flat symbolic paintings[3]. It should also be noted that Winkler is a keen drummer and was a member of the free jazz group known as Triple Trip Touch (aka T.T.T. or TTT).   Ultimately, A.R. Penck managed to establish himself as a key figure of Neo-Expressionism, placing himself alongside authors who shaped this movement. His paintings and sculptures, characterized by simplified shapes and forms, marked a pivotal time for modern art that was reaching its peak of creativity. And by authoring these pieces, A.R. Penck secured his legacy as one of the authors who dictated the course and tempo of the his particular branch of modern art[4], massively contributing a collective process of getting it to a point we can now call contemporary art.

Laurie Simmons,"An American photographer and filmmaker, Laurie Simmons is associated with the Pictures Generation group of artists, and best known for her images of dollhouses, puppets, and dummies. Born in 1949 in Long Island, NY, Simmons graduated from the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia in 1971, and moved to New York in 1973. She currently lives and works in New York with her husband, painter Carroll Dunham. She exhibited widely, including venues such as Artists Space, New York, NY; P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; Metro Pictures Gallery, New York, NY; and Jewish Museum, New York; among others. Her work is in a number of permanent collections, including Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington DC), Hara Museum (Tokyo), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art (Los Angeles, CA), Museum of Modern Art, Solomon R Guggenheim Museum of Art and Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam). In her early works, Simmons depicted dollhouses that evoke Dutch paintings of interiors and the advertisements found in 1950s housekeeping magazines. Throughout her practice, she has been challenging the veracity of photographic realism and the stereotypes of American culture. Continually working with dolls, puppets, and ventriloquist dummies, she endows them with a very human sense of longing and loneliness. ",1965
Felix Gonzalez-Torres,"Best known for his minimal installations and sculptures in which he used materials such as packaged hard candies, clocks, strings of light bulbs, or stacks of paper, Felix Gonzalez-Torres was an American artist born in Cuba. This magnificent subversion of everyday materials was used to express the intimacy-in-distance and distance-in-intimacy as a conjoined dynamic, while it spoke tales of lost love, of photographs of the sublime everyday, the Minimalist economy. It was a wonderful intersection of art, pop culture, and politics, permeated with the inevitable AIDS fears that peaked right when the artist created. Of course, there was light. Somehow, it was always accompanied by the notion of darkness, while Gonzalez-Torres thoughtfully played a tug-of-war, confronting harsh reality and the idea of some better world.  Born in Guáimaro, Cuba, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and his sister Gloria were first sent to Madrid where they stayed in an orphanage until finally moving to Puerto Rico and settling with relatives.[1] He studied at Colegio San Jorge, where he graduated in 1976. Soon after, he began his studies at the University of Puerto Rico, while taking active participation in the local art scene. After earning a fellowship, the artist moved to New York in 1979. He was participating in the Whitney Independent Study Program in 1981 and 1983, where his development as an artist was profoundly influenced by his introduction to critical theory. In 1983, he attended the program for the second time and received his BFA in Photography from Pratt Institute of Art. He earned his Masters of Fine Arts from the International Center of Photography and New York University in 1987, and the same year he joined the Group Material (he was a member until 1991), a New York-based group of artists whose intention was to work collaboratively, adhering to principles of cultural activism and community education. Two years later, the Group was invited by the MATRIX Gallery at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive to address the issue of AIDS. Their efforts resulted in Group’s first AIDS Timeline, where the artists assembled their research into an overview, structured by year, of the circumstances under which the epidemic had turned into a national crisis. Among the objects of the investigation were events in the fields of medicine, politics, and statistics, representations of AIDS in the media, and artistic responses. They also addressed widespread stigmatization of people with AIDS, homophobia, and racism, placing these structures in a larger sociopolitical context.[2] Gonzalez-Torres taught at the New York University and briefly at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, and was granted a DAAD fellowship to work in Berlin in 1992 (but did not participate in the artist-in-residence program), and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1993.  There are several distinctive series, with only one mutual thing between – the vast majority of the works are entitled Untitled in quotation marks, sometimes followed by parenthetical title, an intentional naming scheme devised by the artist. Dateline pieces first appeared in 1987, when Gonzalez-Torres assembled lists of various dates in random order interspersed with the names of social and political figures and references to cultural artifacts or world events, many of which related to political and cultural history. These lists, printed in white type on black sheets of photographic paper by the ""photostat"" process, prompted viewers to consider the relationships and gaps between the diverse references as well the construction of individual and collective identities and memories. Begun in 1992, Gonzalez-Torres’ series of light strings are exemplars of the elegant and the eloquent. The viewer’s awareness of their own subjectivity in meaning-making immediately takes place. The light strings vary in length and in the number of bulbs, as well in their installation (which is left to the curator when they are exhibited). They are beautiful, joyful and transient, and yet seem like lone pillars of light in a dark world. One other important feature applied in his installations was the idea of removing – larger part of his installation works invites the viewer to simply take a piece of the work with them, like in a series where the artist would place the packaged candies in the corner of an exhibition space, allowing the visitors to take place in a greater story of passing time and inevitable death by taking candy, contributing to the slow disappearance of the sculpture over the course of the exhibition. Due to the nature of his removable installation, Gonzalez-Torres was considered to be a process artist. Billboards were the artist idea of bringing contemporary art into the public eye and further demystifying it. The images shown on the billboards are drawn from poetic moments in the artist’s life.[3] Opposite to the big, flashy commercials usually seen on billboards, which stand out in pretty much any environment, Gonzalez-Torres’ public pieces immediately became a part of the landscape, and a part of lives or ordinary people who had an opportunity to see them.  Felix Gonzalez-Torres died in 1996 due to AIDS. But who was really Felix Gonzalez-Torres? A Cuban? American? Gay? Artist? A man terminally ill? He was all of those things, and much more. He was an ordinary man with extraordinary abilities for expression, deeply entrenched in the world, feeling all of its darkness, pain, but also its happiness and joy. His talent was recognized during his short life and even shorter career. In 1995, he submitted a proposal for the Venice Biennale but was rejected as the US official representative. In 2007, he was posthumously selected to represent the United States at this prestigious event. With hopes of fostering an appreciation for his work among the general public, scholars, and art historians, the Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation was created in 2002.  References: ",1966
James Rizzi,"James Rizzi was an American pop artist, painter and sculptor, an idol to children worldwide, and a superstar in Germany and Asia. He rose to fame with his brightly colored and vivid images, 3D cityscapes, prints and illustrations. The theme he was working under was simply happiness, the joy of living, and he proudly portrayed the light images of everyday delight, reminding everyone that happiness mustn't be taken for granted and that love for life is all around us. As a pop artist, he liked to use strong bold lines, bright and vivid colors, and to let his imagination loose, not thinking too much into the form and outlines, which made him stand out among the fabricated replicas that we mostly associate with pop art.  Rizzi was born in 1950, in the middle of the 20th century, in the artistic and cultural epicenter of the world, New York. His family comes from European ancestry, Italian and Irish, which gave him a diverse cultural education when he was a boy. He grew up in Brooklyn and attended the Holy Innocents Grammar School, and later the Erasmus High School. Rizzi was often described as a man of sun full character, who knew how to cheer himself up and pick up the spirits among others. After high school, he took a leap year, which turned out to last more than just a year, but the break period turned out to be very beneficial for his art and creativity. When he enrolled the Miami-Dade College, and later the University of Florida at the beginning of the hippie 70's decade, he knew that he wanted a formal education in art, he just couldn't decide which one he wanted, only to end by taking all of them. For the course entry requirement, he made a silkscreen print, color it and combined with matching etching which he attached on the cutout print, added a sheet of foam and made his trademark artwork combo, the mix of painting, 3D sculpture and graphic art. After college, he moved back to New York, where he found Soho district in Manhattan the best place for an artist to be and made his home there. He started hanging out with other artists in the city and participating in outdoor shows. He sold his paintings outside of the major artistic hotspots, in front of MOMA, MET Museum, galleries in Washington Square. His first creations were done in small formats, and he mastered the small-scale drawings, which he started exhibiting in the city. The first exhibition happened in 1976 in Brooklyn Museum. Later came the commission design works, and vinyl case design which he did for many discos and new wave bands in the 80's.   In New York, he was a breath of fresh air, a man who fought the darkness and melancholy with happy, eye-catching images. The first serious engagement was for a Japanese company where he worked as a designer for corporations. James Rizzi worked for television, collaborated with brands while working on the design packaging and made his own designs for puzzle games, flyers, restaurant menus. His most serious commission was the collaboration for the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996. At the opening ceremony, he displayed series of paintings, which were capturing the Olympic spirit, and later continued to burst with life at the Olympic Museum in Switzerland. His favorite place in the world was his hometown New York, where the city itself inspired him to make art. The details in his cityscapes are directly inspired by architecture, dense buildings, skyscrapers, parks, and crowds. His work is a result of mixing various influences, techniques and above all love for painting and daydreaming. He proudly stated out that his favorite artists were Picasso, Paul Klee, Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, and painters from the cartoon producing studios, who knew how to lighten up someone's day and make imaginary worlds closer to the audience. His elaborative style crossed borders and traveled worldwide, but made him a superstar in Germany. He was the first artist ever to design postage stamps in Germany. Rizzi designed toys, boxes, gift wrappings and office interiors. He designed an oval ceiling, nowadays called The Rizzi Dome for the large shopping mall, in Oberhausen, Germany. For the Volkswagen Beetle, he painted and decorated three cars, and for the Lufthansa Boeing 757, he designed the whole exterior. When we think about the uniqueness of James Rizzi art, we think about childhood, invitational aesthetics that do not follow the conventions. We think about urban-naive, about filling the gray cityscapes with colors and playful characters.   Children and adults can relate to his artworks, so can corporations, galleries, and designers. He rebelled against formal conventions and fought against elitism and pretentiousness in art circles. He painter couples in love, children playing, fragmented portraits made porcelain and glass sculptures, and advocated freedom and flexibility. Rizzi believed that anyone could make art as long he has an open mind and willingness to learn. What separated Rizzi art from the rest is his understanding that art has to be an integral part of everyday life, to be present in the practical form. He applied his signature style to many household objects and office supplies, giving the people a chance to discover hidden symbols and the magic of colors in everyday life. Urban art mixed with naive aesthetics showed the power of childlike imagination and how creativity can transform the simple objects into the inventive artifacts. A lot of his work was done for the love of the city life, but he always tried to fight the grayness with optimism and color. He wanted to make art speak out for the lightness of being, helping people to fight the daily grind. In 2001 he designed the famous Happy Rizzi House, The Happiest House in the World, located on the farm in Brunswick, Germany. The house facade is painted in graffiti style and the whole construction is a work of urban and pop art. The five-story building was used as the office space and has been fully restored in 2011. The house is a tourist hotspot and the favorite location of children excursions. It was an inspiration for several entrepreneurs who tried to make replicas in the center of Brunswick, giving that it stands out in the sea of aged faced and concrete. James Rizzi's large elaborate paintings, 3D cityscapes with humanlike figurines, maximalized the delight and joy of pop art.   When the artists pass away, it seems that we remember them through their art. It’s funny, but when it comes to James Rizzi, we are unable to visualize any of his artworks. Not because there are so many, but because when we try, we are overwhelmed with joy and happy memories. He had a gift of inviting people to step into his world, where they would just leave all the troubles and worries behind. As if the time had stopped, and we were somewhere else, somewhere fun and care-free, drinking coffee, watching the baseball game, walking the streets of New York. And every time people went there, every time we shared Rizzi’s vision of life with the others, he was there to greet us all. Maybe he’s gone now, but his magical world of happiness and joy certainly remains. ",1967
Franz West,"By dismissing physical appearance of his artworks and focusing instead on the way they’ll be used, Franz West, an Austrian artist, shaped his artistic approach, employing it until the very end of his life. Emerging from the tradition of Viennese Actionists (without actually belonging there), his early experiences include the cultural extremes of the movement and their attacks on bourgeois sensibilities, on one side, and constant attempts of his older contemporaries as they were struggling to free themselves from Vienna's illustrious heritage, on the other. He developed a personal style that longed for interaction – his works could only be truly understood if being touched, worn, or sat upon. That very contact with the works allowed the viewers to temporarily enter the universe that West has been building carefully throughout his majestic career.  With a frequently absent coal dealer father and a dentist mother (who did take him with her on art-viewing trips to Italy), West didn’t have much of an artistic pedigree. In fact, for a number of years, he was completely clueless of a direction he would like to take in his life. He enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 1977 (when he was already 30 years old) and studied there under Bruno Gironcoli. The artist sometimes even stated that the only reason for him to start making art was to calm his mother, who was growing impatient of her son’s reluctance to do just about anything with his life.[1] He was familiar with the work of Vienna Actionists and their provocative performances that involved dead animals, self-mutilation, and masturbation – they were the dominant force in the Vienna art scene of the 1960s. West renounced the physicality and existential intensity of that kind of work, focusing instead on benign and relaxed lightness. He once said that his first taste of the Actionist’s performance originated in screams of his mother’s patients, coming from her office next door to the family’s apartment. Instead of gruesomeness and intense display, he chose interaction as his modus operandi, a feature that marked his entire career.   By deciding to begin his studies relatively late, it came to be that he already had an understanding of what he wanted to create. Nevertheless, he was inspired by his teacher Bruno Gironcoli, whose overblown sculptures of domestic objects influenced West in the development of his own distinctive idiom. Among his first well-known works are small amorphous objects that are meant to be touched, held, manipulated and contemplated. Called Adaptives or Passstücke, these pieces exist in their own universe of incompleteness and closeness to the body. They were often created phallus-shaped or had some other sexual allusion behind them, and yet they always remained strongly attached to the abstract world. West described some of the art pieces that he’d made to his friend, poet Reinhard Priessnitz, and he coined the original German name for them – Passstücke. Later, the artist sought an adequate English translation, and had to choose between Fitting Piece and Adaptive, preferring the translation and settling on the latter term.[2] These works represented a truce between performance and art object and reflected the artist’s early admiration for the all-white reliefs and paintings of Piero Manzoni and Robert Ryman. With, of course, one big difference – they were created with the intention to be worn, carried, held, or simply touched by the viewers, giving his practice a true interactive dimension.    Originally interested in making paintings, West quickly turned to Adaptives, a small portable sculptures, before he started creating collages and sculptures large in size (that were public and colorful, from time to time). Much of this later work was developed from ideas implicit in the Adaptives. The artist would sometimes invite others to apply paint or collage to their white surfaces. Before he even noticed, he was creating objects too big to handle, entering the world of “legitimate sculpture”. But even these continued to grow, eventually evolving into considerably larger papier-mâché and cardboard works whose fragmentary shapes and distressed surfaces had an ancient mien, as if they had survived the vicissitudes of time. Then he started making larger, hilariously bulbous, vibrantly colored papier-mâché pieces, something that West is arguably best known for. The possibilities of the found furniture incorporated in some of the Adaptives came to be in the center of his focus in the early 1980s, as he was making spindly chairs and divans out of rebar that parodied elegant furniture while being quite elegant and surprisingly comfortable themselves. His ambition slowly grew. So did his installations, where he now created combinations of sculptures, furniture, paintings, and even works made by other artists. In the late ‘90s, West’s focus turned to lacquered aluminum works, some of them inspired by the shapes of Adaptives, but also by the forms of Viennese sausages. Apart from their appeal, they were also meant for lying and sitting, incorporating the basics of furniture. Speaking of furniture, it wasn’t just a viewing point, as it could clearly take on the central role. For example, a piece titled 2625 consisted of two steel and white resin chairs and was placed on a low plinth and separated by a white cube hanging from the ceiling. Anyone who sat inside the installation would be obtuse indeed if they did not feel the transformative effect of their participation, even if from outside it might all appear a trifle austere.[3]   Franz West died in Vienna, Austria on July 26th, 2012 after a long disease. His international renown culminated towards the end of his life in several major exhibitions, including a retrospective at the Baltimore Museum of Art in 2008 and an appearance at the Liverpool Biennial of 2010, but also his possibly greatest honor - the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement, conferred at the Venice Biennale of 2011. “It doesn't matter what the art looks like but how it's used.” These simple words were more than just a phrase for West. Rather, he had them somewhere in his head whenever he was working on a piece. And whatever the form of the work may be, there was always a need for some sort of interaction, placing him along with other artists that considered art a two-way street, where viewers often play a role just as important as the artist himself.  He is represented by the Gagosian Gallery.  References:  ",1968
Elaine Sturtevant,"Reconstructing only from the memory some of the iconic artworks, Elaine Sturtevant achieved recognition for these repetitions borrowed from the other artists, challenging the ideas of originality and ownership. Creating in the realms of Neo-Dada, Conceptual, and Appropriation Art, her works are not merely copies, considering her aim was not to achieve pure duplicate. Instead, Sturtevant exploited her extraordinary memory and using a mimicry she actually explored “the silent power of art” or appearances beyond its surface, striving to reveal the underlying conceptual structure of the artwork. From 2000, the artist turned to film and video, advertising and internet-based images with the aim of producing reflections of our visually saturated culture.  Sturtevant was born in 1924 in Lakewood, Ohio. She gained her education at the University of Iowa earning a bachelor’s degree in Psychology and master’s at the Teachers College of Colombia University. She has also studied at the Art Students League in NY. The first years of her artistic life in NY were marked by the use of reproductions of the works of her contemporaries which she did for the first time in 1964, achieving the pieces that could be identified as an original and intriguing the viewer to ask himself what is he looking at. She had no problem to appropriate some of the most iconic artworks, exploring the issues of originality, authorship, and the interior structures of art and image culture. Inverting the visual logic of Pop Art, she created her versions of Andy Warhol’s Flowers, Jasper Johns’ Flags and Frank Stella’s Black and Grey paintings, following the same approach later after moving to Paris, when she processed works of Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Beuys, and Anselm Kiefer [1]. Although at the beginning the artist has been faced with hostility, some artists she borrowed from were not angry, but even helped her by giving her instructions and showing technique to create better copies. As the woman who imitates her male colleagues, Sturtevant passed unnoticed in the history of postwar American art. But, the fact is that her imitations were much more than just copies, they were studies and analyses of chosen works and Sturtevant’s style should be comprehended as the medium for the better understanding of art. At the beginning, her work was accepted as a wit and interesting way to encourage the viewer to ask epistemological questions. Sturtevant’s first solo exhibition has been held in 1965 at the Bianchini Gallery in NY where she showed, beside Jasper John's flags, Oldenburg's soft sculptures, and a Rosenquist drawing, Warhol’s Flowers, a series of silk-screen prints that he revealed to the audience a few weeks before [2]. Constantly facing the misunderstanding, Sturtevant decided to take a break from art in 1974 and for the next ten years, she produced little, re-emerging in 1986 with an exhibition at White Columns in NY when the world apparently was better prepared for her. The understanding of her ideas lies in the relationship between repetition and difference – or how to make people look beyond the surface. As the artist herself said: “The work is done predominantly from memory, using the same techniques, making the same errors and thus coming out in the same place.”   In 1990, Sturtevant decided to leave the United states and move to Europe. It was a kind of escape from the place where people had mostly negative reactions to her approach, including the artists whose work she appropriated. Unlike in her country, European museums welcomed her work, devoting her exhibitions. In 2000, she shifted her interests to film and video, advertising and internet-based images, exploring the current culture overladen with pictures. Instead of repeating other people’s works, she focused on the constant repetitiousness of experience in the post-internet age. During the last few years, there has been a drastically increased interest in her work which became the subject of numerous shows including the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt am Main, the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Kunsthalle, Zurich, the Serpentine Galleries in London, and the Moderna Museet, Stockholm which organized the retrospective in 2012 named Sturtevant: Image Over Image. Commenting her creative expression in this new age, the artist said: “What is currently compelling is our pervasive cybernetic mode, which plunks copyright into mythology, makes origins a romantic notion, and pushes creativity outside the self. Remake, reuse, reassemble, recombine – that's the way to go.” [3] From the 1980’s when appropriation became usual and widely accepted technique among young artists, Sturtevant’s work has found its true recognition making a powerful influence on these new generations.   The essence of her work has not been changed for more than five decades, reflection, thinking, and analysis were present in her paintings from the 1960s to the latest videos and installations. For the last two decades, she was truly dedicated to the research of current events, focusing on the political implications of cultural images that were shown through her multi-screen video works. Sturtevant died on May 7, 2014, in Paris where she lived and worked since the early 1990’s. She was awarded The Golden Lion award for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Biennale in 2011. In 2007, an original Crying Girl by Roy Lichtenstein sold at auction for $78,400, and in 2011, Sturtevant’s canvas reworking of Crying Girl, the only Sturtevant painting of its kind in existence, sold for $710,500. The artist is represented by Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac. Sources:  ",1969
Marilyn Minter,"It’s so rarely that you come across something visually overwhelming, and yet can’t take your eyes off of it. Lush paintings, photographs, and videos, created by Marilyn Minter, vividly manifest our culture’s complex and sometimes contradictory emotions around the feminine body and beauty. Her work is unique – over-sized close-up paintings (enamel on metal) of makeup-laden lips and eyes to soiled designer shoes, executed in the hyperrealist manner, photographs shot through the wet glass and her broadly popular videos, all leading to Minter being embroiled in controversies over the relationship of her art to feminism, fashion, and celebrity from the start of her career.  Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Minter grew up in Florida, where she lived with her mother. Her interest in art was apparent from an early age, as she began drawing at five years old. Once a beautiful woman, who really cared about the way she looked, her mother became addicted to drugs and played a significant role in the artist’s formative years. Minter taught herself to draw Brenda Starr, and would spend her time just drawing all day long. Even at school, she would barely get by, as all she wanted to do was drawing. It was the 60’s, and Minter went to art school, where, as she states, the only truth was Abstract Expressionism. Pop Art and Conceptual art were swiftly dismissed, but she felt drawn to Warhol and the Factory. The decision to major in photography came after earning a C in painting, but getting an A in photography. During the 70’s, she was in New York, fighting for civil rights and the war in Vietnam. Shutting down the Pentagon, she rather worked for progressive politicians. Speaking of feminism and reproductive rights, she found herself in Washington more than once, marching for the cause.   Some of her best friends are widely known artists – Laurie Simmons, Lorna Simpson, Wangechi Mutu, Mika Rottenberg and Mary Heilmann. Minter also knows a lot more young women artists simply because she goes to them and tells them how great she thinks they are. James Rosenquist is a major inspiration and was her idol in college. Threads of both his and the work of Andy Warhol are all through her work. Messier than them, and a lot wetter, she takes a female perspective, differentiating from her role-models. Minter’s attraction to wet things led to the liquid being prevalent in her works. As she states: “Whenever I’m shooting, I want a wet model. It happened from the very beginning. People start sweating, and they get better looking somehow, sexier or a little more interesting.” The bit of distortion it adds helps in breaking the illusion of perfection. The influences of a variety of other people are evident – from Chuck Close’s Photorealism, Minimalism seen in the work of Sylvia Plimack Mangold, famous clown created by Bruce Nauman, Sigmar Polke‘s half-tones, still-life painted by Janet Fish, to Mike Kelley’s animal sculptures. Also, Jeff Koons and Minter shared a similar fate after including elements of porn in their work and were both kicked out of the world of art in the early nineties. The puppy was his way back, but Minter ""earned her forgiveness"" through a much more intimate body of work – the photographs of her mother, created back in 1969.   Pretty/Dirty is a retrospection of a career that has spanned more than thirty years. A careful section that included more than 25 paintings, 3 videos and several photographs portray her career in depth, leaving nothing out. Some of the pieces that were included are: Little Girls #1 (1986), from her monumentally-sized series from the mid-1980s titled Big Girls, Little Girls – Big Girls, (from the same series) was also on display; Blue Poles (2007), undoubtedly one of Minter’s most famous paintings, portraying a clearly beautiful face and at the same time revealing the flaws – a pimple, the freckles and the errant eyebrow hairs. Minter’s fascination with the fashion industry (and one more proof to her connection with Warhol) is a piece titled Dirty Heel (2008), where we can see a close up of a woman’s dirty heel accessorized by an expensive looking pink-lined high-heeled shoe. The exhibition was co-organized by the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston and the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, and co-curated by Bill Arning and Elissa Auther.   More than $2.5 million was raised by Cindy Sherman, Laurie Simmons, and Marilyn Minter, as the three of them sold their pieces at the Sotheby's auction. Afterwards, Minter was honored at the Planned Parenthood Women of Valor ceremony. Interested in raising more money for the cause, she thought they need to find a young spokesperson, and shortly after, none other than Miley Cyrus was on board, and the two of them collaborated on a series of prints, whose sale also benefits the organization. Marc Jacobs, a famous fashion designer, joined the team, and he agreed to sell Marilyn x Miley tees for $50 each. This campaign for Planned Parenthood was just a continuation of Minter’s long history of fighting for her beliefs (reproductive rights in this case), making her criticized and loved at the same time, for both her art and her social engagements. She is represented by Markowicz Fine Art in Miami, Me Collectors Room in Berlin and Gregg Shienbaum Fine Art in Miami.  ",1970
Jonathan Meese,"Jonathan Meese is a Berlin-based multimedia artist known to provoke and irritate, but also seduce his worldwide audience. Through his artworks with hints of modern Neo-nazi philosophy, Meese leaves his commentary on crucial issues such as revolution, failed ideologies and the power of art. Meese’s paintings,installations and performances convey bipolar, feverish, at times a raw sexual energy that can be described as vulgar and grotesque but also grandiose. The German artist is one of those people who are not afraid to scream and shout when everyone else is silent and because of this particular quality he is either loved or hated by his audience.  Meese is originally from Japan but he moved from Tokyo to Hamburg in Germany still as a child. He showed artistic tendencies from the early age since he was exceptionally gifted when it comes to combining textures and colors with unusual materials and appropriated pictures. In his teenage years, he used to make numerous photo collages featuring scenes from James Bond series and photographs of his favorite musicians, such as the Beatles. His efforts were not only superficial, he was an exceptionally intelligent child and wanted his collages to convey a certain message, may it be funny, cynical or simply awkward. Because of his great talent, Meese decided to pursue a formal education and enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Hamburg, where he showed a strong interest in Dada, installation, video and performance. At the same time, he was studying philosophy and writings of Friedrich Nietzsche became decisively influential on his work. Meese's goal was to make his art as narrative as possible, because of his strong need to share his opinions related to the political and ideological issues of the past and present.   It is hard to categorize Meese’s work, but what is commonly found in his pieces is the wild atmosphere combined with rawness and primordial forces which seem impossible to tame. His paintings represent a chaotic mix of bold colors and messages that sound like a certain propaganda. He extensively uses religious and political symbols such as the various crosses and well-known Hitler’s swastika. Anything with Neo-Nazi references is susceptible to public abhorrence nowadays, but Meese doesn’t really seems to care. In his world, swastika takes on the symbolism of power, dominance, and even sexual libido, since it is often combined with suggestively red, fleshy tones. The artist's sculptures carry the same sense of rawness and monstrosity. They are figurative in their nature and often represent mythological monsters or strangely appropriated items, such as random pieces of metal combined with used, shabby textiles. There are a lot of military references in Meese’s installations and sculptures, most common among them being nondescript figures that resemble horses carrying warriors. War, violence and sexuality are the keywords for the entire Meese’s body of work.   Meese had a great response in terms of his performance in Northern Europe and the United States. He initially showed his work in Copenhagen’s Statens in 2005, together with performance and installation pieces which featured satyr-like figures, representing a strong male libido. Also, in 2005 Meese finished one of his most important sculptural pieces called Der Propagandist, which was another provocation, again with sexual overtones. The sculpture is tall, bronze figure accompanied by two pairs of erect twin phalluses. Since 2008, Meese is exhibiting in the United States as well and his first solo exhibition was held at Bortolami gallery in New York City. The artist's performance at Bortolami was intense and noisy and it consisted of yelling and giving the Nazi salute. Currently, there are 56 pieces of Meese's work on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art in north Miami. Another interesting fact about Meese is  that he designs theater sets and has written and starred in theater productions. He designed the stage for the opera Dionysus at the Salzburg Festival in 2010.   Even though Meese’s projects can’t appeal to everyone, their value still lies in the open rawness they display. Just like the violent acts in music serve to relieve the tension caused by the expectations that civilized society had given us, so is Meese’s work here to make us question our own mask imposed by the society. Perhaps, somewhere deep below, all of us are still warriors, fighters and not overly sophisticated souls, just like some of the creatures that Meese has created. The artist said it best in one of his interviews – in art you have to go too far. The artist is represented by Galerie Fluegel-Roncak.  ",1971
Elizabeth Catlett,"Elizabeth Catlett was a sculptor, painter, and printmaker well-known for producing politically charged black expressionistic sculptures and prints in the 1960s and the 1970s. Catlett was born on April 15, 1915 in Washington, DC, and attended Dunbar High School. She received a scholarship to study at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, PA, but was rejected by the institution because of her race. In 1935, Catlett earned a BS and graduated cum laude from Howard University School of Art, in Washington, DC. She went on to graduate with an MFA from the University of Iowa in 1940, before moving on to study ceramics at the Art Institute of Chicago, IL. In 1942, she studied lithography at the Art Students League in New York City, and then, in 1943, she joined Ossip Zadkine to study sculpting. In most of her works, the artist combined fundamental elements of African traditions with the traditions of African Americans and western Mexico. Catlett was originally enrolled to study design, printmaking, and drawing, but later changed her major to painting, due to the influence of James A. Porter, and because Howard University did not have a sculpting department at the time. She taught for two years in North Carolina, but quit due to low salaries paid to black teachers. She was the first student to graduate with an MFA at the University of Iowa, and was greatly influenced by Grant Wood, who produced great paintings of the American landscape. She sculpted Mother and Childin 1939, and a year later it won her first prize at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago, IL. Catlett was involved in a number of exhibitions, including Prints & Drawings, at Stragow Gallery, New York, 1998, and Wood Sculpture, at June Kelly Gallery, New York, 2002. Catlett received a number of awards, such as the Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award by the International Sculpture Center, in 2003. She is part of many collections around the world, including those of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, GA, the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico, and the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. On April 2, 2012, Catlett passed away in Cuernavaca, Mexico.   ",1972
Marcel Dzama,"The painter, filmmaker, and draughtsman Marcel Dzama is best known for his dream-like works on paper. The artist uses graphite, ink, watercolors, and muted colors of earth to create otherworldly figures, fantastical worlds, alternate histories, and iconography. Drawing inspiration from Dada and Surrealist movement, Dzama combines humor and whimsy with absurdity, dark humor, and nightmares. He has had a number of exhibitions around the world, including Kunsthalle Mannheim, Germany; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga, Spain; Kunstmuseum Thun, Switzerland; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Le Magasin – Centre National d’Art Contemporain de Grenoble, France, and Museo de Arte de Zapopan, Zapopan, Mexico. Born in 1974 in Winnipeg, Canada, Marcel Dzama graduated with BFA from the University of Manitoba. He was a founder of the student group The Royal Art Lodge, dedicated to the art of illustration. The artist is influenced by the work of masters, such as Francisco Goya and William Blake, as well as the childhood imagery of Dracula and Wolfman. Thus, often his work is a perfect blend of contradictions, starting with sweet and violent, familiar yet surreal, elegant and chaotic. In his early work, Dzama drew only three to four figures leaving the background white, thus isolating them in an endless landscape. Later, after the move to New York, the artists began filling up the empty space with figures, such as owls, bats, dancers, animals, and humans, some naked and others in polka-dot bodysuits. To create order amid all the chaos, he incorporated dance choreography and began drawing stylized formations. Marcel Dzama has also created covers of record albums for several bands, such as They Might Be Giants, The Weakerthans, and Beck. The artist has also worked as a costume designer for Bob Dylan’s music video When the Deal Goes Down and Department of Eagles’ No One Does It Like You song. In 2013 he published, together with Spike Jonze, Raymond Pettibon, and Dave Eggers, Marcel Dzama: Sower of Discord, a monograph of more than 500 drawings and images. In his movie A Jester’s Dance (Une danse des bouffons) from 2013, one can see clear influences of Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia. The violent world of the tree-like creatures and humanoid animals feature in two of his movies, The Infidels (2009) and The Lotus Eaters (2007). For the diorama Rebellion Lay in Her Way (2011), Dzama uses collage, wood, and glass to create his signature chaotic world. Dzama is the recipient of several awards, including the ARCO Award, Madrid (2012); New Artist Award, Art Cologne (2000), and The Hnatyshyn Foundation Award for Outstanding Achievement as an Artist, Ottawa (2013). Two collections of his works were published by McSweeney, The Berlin Years in 2003, and The Berliner Ensemble Thanks You All, in 2008. The latest exhibition titled Who Loves the Sun in 2021 in New York coincided with a major survey of Dzama’s work at Sara Hildén Art Museum in Finland. Marcel Dzama lives and works in New York.

Rineke Dijkstra,"Rineke Dijkstra is a renowned photographer and video artist. The array of models she uses for her photographs is wide, ranging from club-goers, school children, matadors, soldiers and young mothers. She positions her subjects against a minimal background, facing the camera. Her subjects are often taken out of context, immediately after a stressful or emotional situation, such as her series of matadors and newly mothers. Rineke’s specific compositional style is most notable in her beach portraits, which feature one or more adolescents against a seascape. She perfectly captures the awkwardness and self-consciousness of adolescence, due to the earnest nature of youngsters, and their emotions revealed.   Rineke's subjects are depicted in an unembellished fashion. Caught in the moment, they appear simultaneously revealing and enigmatic. Her portraits are stark and engaging, as she often focuses on particular communities of people, revealing their inner world through the simplicity of one particular moment in their lives. Dijkstra is also a video artist, known for her filmed portraits of teenagers in nightclubs in Liverpool, against a white background, smoking, and dancing. Born in 1959 in Sittard, the Netherlands, she studied at the Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. In 1984 Rineke had her first solo exhibition at Amsterdam’s Gallery de Moor. She worked as a professional portrait photographer until the 1990s, when she started incorporating her own artistic style into portraiture.    With a preference for introverted people, Rineke feels an affinity with them and can create a more stable contact than with exuberant individuals. With more introverted people she can demand a concentration which is decisive for the photographs and which she demands from herself as well. Dijkstra creates a very close contact with subjects, sustaining their attention. Rineke’s favorite subjects are those on a transformative path of teenagehood or adults who have just gone through a highly emotional experience. These subjects display a vulnerability that enables her to capture the gap between intention and effect, showing how not everything can be kept under control. A perfect example for this is her series of mothers who recently gave birth.    One of Rineke’s first major series – Beaches, is comprised of portraits of young adolescents in bathing suits on the beach. This series expanded her work to an audience at international level. Dijkstra usually uses a standard lens on a tripod and flesh on another tripod behind the first one. For the Beaches series, she used the same setup, only with a portable flash to reduce contrast and bring the subject’s faces out of deep shadow, thus modulating the sunlight, which is always her main light source. The seascape serves merely as a background, since the artist doesn’t focus on details, but emphasizes the individual, capturing the visual cues, illuminating the subject’s psychological and emotional state. The Beaches series are large-format color photographs, taken on beaches in Belgium, Croatia, Poland, USA, and Ukraine. All subject are framed full-length in the center of the picture, standing out against the background, gazing at the camera. Depending on the place where the photo was taken, quality of wardrobe and subject’s poses vary from self-assured to awkward self-conscious. Rineke’s photographs are entitled to the place and time when the photograph is captured, emphasizing that moment in time that is immortalized.   The Dutch artist's  Beaches project was shown in 1997 at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, bringing the artist international acclaim. Her photographs were subject of numerous solo exhibitions, notably including Rinkeke Dijkstra: A Retrospective shown both at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and New York’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2012. Rineke was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in 2012. The artist claims to be influenced by the Dutch masters of painted portrait such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Verspronck.   ",1974
Michael Manning,"Michael Manning is an American comic book artist born in 1963 in Flushing in the New York City borough of Queens. Manning is also known as writer, fine art illustrator and traditionally trained animator. He is best known for his graphic novel series, The Spider Garden and Tranceptor, which combine elements of pan-sexual fetishism and BDSM culture with complex characters in science fiction and fantasy settings. He is also active in the supernatural horror and fantasy genres, drawing adaptations of the work of authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, and Alexandre Dumas for the Graphic Classics comics anthology series, as well as illustrating an anachronistic version of the German folk epic, The Nibelungen. Manning went on to study film and animation at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He began self-publishing art and comics in 1987 while working at Olive Jar Animation in Brookline, MA, as an animator and director of short films, commercials, and music videos. A move to San Francisco in 1991 coincided with Manning's decision to focus on comic books and erotic illustration full-time. Manning continued to self-publish and produce work for the Bay Area's emerging BDSM/sex-zine community while his artwork and stage/costume design for multi-media performances appeared regularly at local music venues, fetish events, and art galleries. He also wrote and drew four volumes of the Spider Garden series that consists of following volumes: The Spider Garden (1995), Hydrophidian (1996), In A Metal Web (2004), and In A Metal Web II (2004). In collaboration with artist Patrick Conlon he wrote the first installment of the Tranceptor series. After Manning moved to Los Angeles, a second collection, Inamorata: The Erotic Art of Michael Manning was published by the Last Gasp in 2005. The second volume in the Tranceptor series, Iron Gauge, was published in 2007. Manning's artwork has been exhibited in galleries in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Boston, Omaha, Miami, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Milan. In 2002, mural-sized reproductions of panels from his In a Metal Web graphic novel were featured as part of a special installation at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts comic book themed exhibition Fantastic! Comics and the Art of Illusion. Michael Manning currently lives and works in Los Angeles, California.   ",1975
Andy Goldsworthy,"Using the temporal materials as the reflection of the world we live in, Andy Goldsworthy collaborates with nature creating ephemeral works which remain immortalized only on photographs. Traveling around the world in a quest for perfect environment, he strives to understand nature by his direct participation, enjoying the freedom provided by the possibility to create something just using his hands and material that is within reach. His outdoor sculptures of snow, ice, leaves, rock, clay, feather and twigs represent the idea of change, movement, growth, and decay that are the vitality of nature, the driving energy that he tries to elicit through his pieces. Using the earth as a source, he makes art sensitive as every process that happens around us. Nature and land are in a state of change which itself is the key to understanding.  Goldsworthy was born in 1956 in Cheshire as the son of F. Allin Goldsworthy, professor of applied mathematics at the University of Leeds. Growing up on the Harrogate side of Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in a house ending the green belt and working on farms since the age of 13, he was obviously influenced with the repetitive routine of farm tasks that is widely applied in his creative approach. He has studied fine art at Bradford College of Art and later received Bachelor of Arts at the University of Central Lancashire. Always disliking work indoors, he found his escape nearby Morecambe Bay where he has created his first temporary structures collapsed under a flood tide. He very soon realized that his artistic interests were closely connected to his rural childhood than to classes and studio surroundings. Instead of representing the landscape, he used it as a “canvas”, representing the works of transcendent beauty. The artist often changed his place of residence and in a quest for the perfect environment he traveled all around the world making sculptures, besides at England and Scotland, at the North Pole, in Japan, the Australian Outback, in the United States and many other countries. Taking the opportunity each kind of day weather offers, he always strives to take the best of it finding the satisfaction in a freedom of expression. But he goes under the surface and the leaves, rocks or branches are not the pure materials, but represents the life in and around them. Because of the transient nature of his work, photography has the main role in providing evidence and an access to a wider viewing public. “Each work grows, stays decays – integral parts of a cycle which the photograph shows at its heights, marking the moment when the work is most alive. There is an intensity about a work at its peak that I hope is expressed in the image. Process and decay are implicit.”[1] Through the camera, he is able to manipulate color, light, perspective, and other effects, taking the work out of its natural surroundings. Also considered the pioneer of modern rock balancing, he doesn’t use any tools but his bare hands, teeth and found help on the site. Still, creating the permanent pieces, such as Roof, Stone River, Moonlight Path or Chalk Stones he sometimes has to employ machine tools. Whether permanent or ephemeral, the main characteristic and the essence of his creations is the concern about the relationship of people and the world around them. “My approach to larger, more permanent work is longer-term. There is a process of familiarization with the site through drawings that explore the location and space. This is the only time I use drawing to work through ideas; for me, it represents a change in approach. I often live with a site at the back of my mind for months, sometimes years--a target for energies and ideas. By working large, I am not trying to dominate nature. If people feel small in relation to a work, they should not assume that there is an intention to make nature itself small. If anything, I am giving nature a more powerful presence in the mass of earth, rock, wood that I use. I do not change the underlying processes of growth, and nature's grip is tightened on the site that I have worked”[2]. His art influences the people to question how life affects and is affected by ecological systems and cultural conditions. Considering humans an integral part of nature, Goldsworthy encourages and intrigues all five senses to feel and look closer at the surroundings.     During the winter of 1988/89, along with the group of assistants, Goldsworthy created eighteen monumental Snowballs displayed in the Old Museum of Transport in Glasgow where they remained five days, gradually melting which was documented through the series of photographs and performances. One more example of his documentation of ephemeral change is the Ballet Atlantique, a performance that diverts the attention of the passing of time. Series of photographs recorded the transit of sticks thrown into the air. This is in accordance with his beliefs that the intensity of gestural act of creation exists only for a moment, followed by the process of generation, regeneration, and decay.  One of his foremost works, his first museum commission for a permanent piece in the United States, but also the largest single installation to date, Storm King Wall, reflects his nature-based methodology through this dry stone walls, originated from the British agricultural tradition. Imagined as a 750-foot-long wall meandering through the wood to the large oak tree, it finally reached the nearby lake downhill. After some time, the wall was extended again, emerging on the other shore, continuing uphill to Storm King’s western boundary at the New York State Thruway, making the total of 2,278 feet. Up to five feet high, built stone-by-stone of the remains of an old farm wall found in the woods, the line follows the path that artist himself chose, partially coinciding with the old one. Designed and supervised by Goldsworthy, the construction was built by a team of stonemasons, shaping each piece and placing on top of the another with no concrete or any bonding material. In 2010, on the fifteenth anniversary, the artist and his team returned to construct Five Men, Seventeen Days, Fifteen Boulders, One Wall in a nearby field that Goldsworthy memorized upon his last visit. Working for seventeen days, they lifted the 309-foot long wall using the 250 tons of stones, evoking the ancient ruins. In 2005, he produced another commissioned work for the entry courtyard of San Francisco’s De Young Museum called Drawn Stone. The artwork represents an embodiment of the situation with frequent earthquakes and their consequences that affect this city. Consisted of a giant crack in the pavement that broke off into smaller cracks, and broken limestone that could be used as a bench, the artist used the hammer to convey the effect of the cracks. Not seeing himself as a designer of his works, the artist thinks that designing something implies forethought and plan that should be followed. But, his pieces grow gradually and without any expectations, layer by layer, rock by rock, leaf by leaf, completely unpredictable. Sometimes work collapses, once of more times, but that act of building and rebuilding itself becomes the part of an art piece because the failure is very important in both art and life. “To achieve what I want, to achieve the works that I make, I have to be fully committed to them succeeding. I couldn't make them otherwise. And you cannot feel that commitment without feeling or having a deep sense of loss when they do collapse or fail, and that's inevitable.”[3] One of the interesting outdoor works is his rain shadows, the artist’s imprints on the ground when it’s raining. Although sounds simple, this complicated process requires much patient – sometimes it stops raining when he’s half-way through and in some cases he just has to lay down for hours waiting for the shower. With the aim of understanding the atmospheric precipitation, during the time, Goldsworthy learned everything about the rain, recognizing its different rhythm and kinds. Enjoying the cold weather, there are rare freezing winters during the last years, so the artist uses every opportunity to exploit ice. Often, his work in ice is only a reflection of the things he did in stone, so he claims that one can learn much about the stone by working with ice and vice versa. The hard side of the work with this material is the fact that temperature rarely stays below freezing all day long in Britain, so he must work on dark and very quickly before the temperature starts to rise and the piece collapses.   From the beginning of his career, Andy Goldsworthy rejected the traditional idea of the artistic studio, working exclusively outdoors. From 1976 until 1984, he has been creating only ephemeral works in natural environments captured by the camera. His more recent work consists of mostly permanent installations that he calls “a living part of the landscape”. Goldsworthy has produced more than seventy exhibitions and projects all over the world including those in the Canadian Arctic, Digne, France, the streets of London, and Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. At the same time, he has made temporary museum installations at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles (1997), The Metropolitan Museum of Art (2004), New York, and The Tate, Liverpool (2004), among others. Goldsworthy's other large-scale installations in the United States include Garden of Stones (2003, Museum of Jewish Heritage, New York), Three Cairns (2001-2003, Des Moines Art Center, Iowa), Neuberger Cairn (2001, Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, New York), West Coast Cairn (2002, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego), Stone River (2001, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California), and Storm King Wall (1999, Storm King Art Center, Mountainville, New York). All of these large-scale commissioned works have their origins in ephemeral works[4]. Andy Goldsworthy is the subject of a 2001 documentary feature film called Rivers and Tides, directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer.  References:   ",1976
NAWER,"NAWER is a Polish Architect, designer and street artist. He earned his degree in Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Technology in Cracow and has been involved in street art culture for almost 25 years. His unique and prolific artistic aesthetics are born from the urge to reunite architecture and fine arts. In his highly geometrical approach, NAWER creates images that are not only influenced by the architecture in which they are situated, but also reflect a vision for urban structures.  When he paints in situ, his work intrigues with its site specify, his work on canvas is dominated by almost mathematically derived visual satisfaction. He created Artde7 Studio in 2006, with a focus on interior and graphic design, along with scenography. Creativity stems toward isometric graphics as extant of public and functional spaces. Interior spatiality is described as a blend of objects within space, while painting by perspective and axonometry using aerosol as a main medium. The combination of these two approaches allows a fresh take on the design of arrangement and creativity of an interior space. As his style evolves, the goal is to always strive forward in an effort to connect painting with architecture. He has been part of many solo and group shows in cities such as Berlin, Paris, Glasgow and Warsaw. In 2012 he received an honorable mention from the Jury of the ARTAQ Awards. Nawer lives and works in Cracow, Poland.",1977
Norman Parkinson,"Norman Parkinson was British and one of the twentieth century's best-known fashion photographers. He was active for over 50 years and was instrumental in taking portrait and fashion photography beyond the stiff formality of his predecessors and injecting an easy and casual elegance into his images. Norman Parkinson's impulsive and unstructured style changed forever the static, posed approach to fashion photography, while his enchanting, idiosyncratic persona charmed his sitters and projected an alluring and glamorous public image. Standing at 6 feet 5 inches tall, Parkinson was unable to remain unobtrusive behind the lens and instead created ‘Parks’, the moustachioed, ostentatiously elegant fashion photographer – as much a personality as those who sat for him, and frequently more flamboyant. His flawless professionalism, manners and well-rehearsed eccentricities reassured the uneasy sitter and disarmed the experienced.His photographs of celebrities, artists, and the British Royal Family, as well as leading figures from the worlds of film, theatre, politics and music are known throughout the world and have become icons of twentieth century style. In a career that spanned seven decades, Norman Parkinson dazzled the world with his sparkling inventiveness as a portrait and fashion photographer. His work provides a comprehensive and unique record of the development of fashion design, photography and modelling from the 1940’s to 1990. By charting the changing face of fashion through the twentieth century, Norman Parkinson’s work also serves as a hugely significant historical record and a reflection of the societal changes that shaped our modern culture. Parkinson worked for a wide range of publications, once declaring “a photographer without a magazine behind him is like a farmer without fields”. His long association with Vogue (working with Audrey Withers, Diana Vreeland and Grace Coddington amongst many others), and his numerous assignments for Harper’s Bazaar, Town & Country and other international magazines, brought him worldwide recognition. Parkinson’s work is still considered hugely innovative and his influence remains evident in the work of many contemporary photographers. Parks reinvented himself for each decade of his career, from his ground- breaking, spontaneous images of the 1930s, through the war years and the Swinging Sixties to the exotic locations of the 1970s and 1980s. By the end of his life he had become a household name, the recipient of a CBE, a photographer to the royal family, an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, and the subject of a large scale retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Norman Parkinson died whilst on location in Singapore shooting for Town and Country in 1990.   ",1978
Mr.,"A Japanese contemporary artist, Mr. is best known for his neo-pop aesthetic that spans across painting, sculpture, installation and video. Using manga and anime to portray his personal fantasies, he creates cartoonish visions populated by young characters, who are meant to evoke feelings of ""moe"", a Japanese notion relating to the adoration of fictional figures. Born in Cupa, Japan, Mr. currently lives and works in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from Sokei Art School in 1996, having been discovered by Murakami the year prior. He has since worked as an assistant to Murakami, and member of Murakami's Kaikai Kiki studio, which has also supported Mr. in his solo career. He took his pseudonym after a former Yomiuri Giants baseball player Shigeo Nagashima, who was frequently referred to as ""Mr. Giants"". Mr. is a self-proclaimed otaku, a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, commonly the anime and manga fandom, with a Lolita complex. He works in a distinct kawaii aesthetics, fusing high and low forms of contemporary expression, often depicting childlike features with innocent undertones. Despite the bright cheerfulness of his all-powerful characters, there is a wider reflection on solitude, social anxiety, and fear in his works. A self-proclaimed otaku - a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, commonly the anime and manga fandom - with a Lolita complex, which he says he does not act upon, his pieces depict young boys and girls in an anime and manga style, drawing upon the aesthetics and attitudes of otaku culture, and lolicon themes - a term originally shorthand for ‘Lolita Complex’.",1979
Josh Smith,"Josh Smith is a young American artist who uses a variety of mediums, such as painting, sculpture, collage and installation, in order to playfully comment on various trends in art by turning their ideas upside down. Smith's works often feature his name as the main subject or casual motifs such as leaves, fish, skeletons, insects, ghosts, and palms. The way Smith renders his subjects is rather playful, repetitive, and even aggressive at times. His goal is to make his viewers focus on the process of his art making rather than the mere aesthetics.  Josh Smith was born in the mid-70s and he is originally from Knoxville, Tennessee. He studied at Miami University from 1994 to 1996, but eventually he earned his BFA from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 1998. In addition to his career in painting, Smith is also a successful bookmaker and ceramicist. His style is strongly related to the tendencies of his generation of artists. Also, his training in printmaking made a strong impact of his pieces. A lot of his works are mixed-media creations which combine hand-made and found objects and in this way underline the meaning of originality. Also, he is known to incorporate digital images of his previous works into his new pieces. Smith uses mainly murky colors and wide brushstrokes because he's not interested in precision, but rather in exploring a different type of abstraction For Smith, his work is an important part of his identity and his communicational style. Painting is like talking to me, it is how I communicate, Smith says.   Smith's works are bold and direct - they speak directly to the viewer and they are able to force a certain interaction. His paintings are known to violate the rules of formal representation and traditional approach in order to give space to abstraction. Through his innovative, energetic and sometimes bizarre art, Smith has built a reputation of a bad boy among various indie film and fashion types. Even though his paintings, collages, and books seem messy, they are also considered emotional and sophisticated and they are quite popular among collectors, galleries, and museums. In 2015, an online documentary about Josh Smith was released on the Internet. It is a 20-minute piece made by Max Fierst and it covers the artist’s history of paintings, sculpture, and publishing, but it also focuses on his body of work called Sculpture, which was exhibited at Luhring Augustine gallery in New York.    Smith's unusual pieces have been very successful ever since his early shows in 2003. Smith has had many solo exhibitions in the United States and abroad, held at important artspaces such as the Bonner Kunstverein in Bonn, Museo d’Arte Contemporanea in Rome, The Brant Foundation in Greenwich, CT, and MUMOK, Vienna.Smith has also participated in numerous group exhibitions such as The Painting Factory: Abstraction after Warhol at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, Le Printemps de Septembre in Toulouse and ILLUMInations in the 2011 Venice Biennale. His highly original pieces which combine digital and traditional approach can be also found in several public collections - the Centre Pompidou in Paris, MUMOK in Vienna, the Whitney Museum and MOMA in New York, to name just a few.   Josh Smith is an extraordinary artist hard to categorize - while some of his pieces look negligently and arbitrarily composed, they still have a very powerful emotional content and hence the undeniable quality. Using his wide and playful brushstrokes together with the great sense of humor, Smith creates his very own, unique communication with his audience. At the same time, his pieces offer a certain commentary on the modern world we're living in and on the contemporary art creations and their controversial nature.  ",1980
David Reed,"David Reed is an abstract painter who works on large canvases. When he started out as a painter he fell in love with the strong and significant trails his brushes were leaving, and that became his signature move. While he was a student he was eager to learn and to explore, and his desire to imprint a meaning into the painting stayed with him to the present days. His palette is bright, his brushstrokes are visible and the dimensions of the canvases are directly inferencing the artist himself. When there is a vertical picture there is a shadow of its creator in front of it. At the beginning of his career in the 60s, the main subject was the bare process of creation, how a painting was made and how the method looked like. They looked like someone was taking a photo of the painting process and merged them into a larger piece. That reminded him of filmmaking and that is how these three art directions lead to the original abstract painting he is now famous for doing.   David was born and grew up in California where he attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. He studied at Reed College in Portland, Oregon and earned his BA in 1986. When he moved to New York he spent a lot of time at the New York Studio School, where he was not registered as an official student, but he attended many seminars with the famous artists from that time. Although his contemporaries were abandoning painting, he knew that painting was the only thing he wanted to do and practice. Everything had to have a concept, a meaning or a hidden idea, and Reed discovered that his idea was lying in the structure and surface of the painting. His works look like they were cut into pieces and reassembled together insinuating the video films. Bright technicolor palette refers to computer screens and digital art. His personal vision is that the image should not imitate reality, it should show the artist's vision. In the digital age, the accent is on reproduction, whereas for Reed the emphasis is in creation.   Reed was the adviser for the exhibition High Times, Hard Times: New York Painting 1967-1975 and many artists from that collection shared the same history as he did. They all came from smaller towns to New York, the artistic mecca at that time, to explore and excel as artists. Embracing the Abstract Expressionism was freeing and relieving because abstraction meant freedom and equality. Everyone was welcome, and everyone was encouraged to share their vision. With Reed, like many other artists, it was important to share personal philosophy and beliefs, and that is where he found his true calling. Being an artist in New York at that time was everything but easy, since making intellectual abstract art did not earn a lot of money, there were days where he was squatting and living in abandoned buildings. Using color and light to express himself he found a sense of freedom in his work. He paints to show who he is.    Reed's paintings act as a live entity where they provide a unique projection of the live person. His earlier works were vertical, but his more recent items are horizontal. The change of the form originated from the evolution of the idea. Now, the paintings represent the shadow of the human being. What was an artist in person before, now is a digital film or a ghost in the media body. Our digital screens, computers and smartphones are staring at us in landscape mode, and the paintings insinuate how our spirit must feel like when being neglected like that. There is a special characteristic of his work, found in the free form of abstraction, where he likes to pretend his works are live entities. He made a Vertigo project where he put scans of two of his paintings as characters in Hitchcock's film. The resemblance is uncanny because of his specific brushstrokes that make his art look like it's been taken from a video film. He named this video installation Two Bedrooms in San Francisco inspired by stories of people who bought his artwork and hung it in their bedrooms.   The surface of his composition was directly correlating to the surface of the film. There was no information lost when he made a switch. His idea for this project was that paintings can live, lead lives of their own because they are the epitome of an artist's freedom. Free as they are, the pictures can sometimes narrate a story of their own. Reed's play with color has the ambition to humanize the contemporary scene. Unlike before, where the inspiration was being chased outdoors, in the physical world, in the modern age, we are being surrounded by artificial and synthetic elements. It is difficult to relate to the neon plastic and unnatural items and their bright colors because they do not resemble anything people are used having an emotion towards. That is why Reed is using his art to share a political and anthropological vision of how we deal with our emotions and where we find our sentimental soul when we chase it aways with our computer screen and digital reality.

Richard Pettibone,"Richard Pettibone is one of the pioneers of appropriation art. The artist helped set the stage for 80's appropriation art by recycling the pop culture appropriations of Pop Art. Pettibone was born in Los Angeles, and first worked with shadow boxes and assemblages, illustrating his interest in craft, construction, and working in miniature scales. In 1964, he created the first of his appropriated pieces, two tiny painted “replicas” of the iconic Campbell’s soup cans by Andy Warhol. By 1965, he had created several “replicas” of paintings by American artists, such as Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Ed Ruscha, and others, among them some of the biggest names in Pop Art. Pettibone chose to recreate the work of leading avant-garde artists whose careers were often centered on themes of replication themselves, further lending irony to his work. Pettibone also created both miniature and life-sized sculptural works, including an exact copy of Bicycle Wheel by Marcel Duchamp, and in the 1980s, an entire series of sculptures of varying sizes replicating the most famous works of Constantin Brancusi. In more recent years, Pettibone has created paintings based on the covers of poetry books by Ezra Pound, as well as sculptures drawn from the grid compositions of Piet Mondrian. Pettibone straddles the lines of appropriation, Pop, and Conceptual Art, and has received critical attention for decades for the important questions his work raises about authorship, craftsmanship, and the original in art. His work has been exhibited at the Institute for Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Miami, and the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach, CA. Pettibone is currently based in New York.",1982
Riusuke Fukahori,"Being original is a hard achievement to succeed at these days. We are constantly bombarded with so many information that it's sometimes almost impossible to think outside the box. Whether you're writing a book or a screenplay, trying to paint or you've decided to build something - it's vital to be yourself. If you think it's too hard or impossible to be one hundred percent original, you should definitely take a closer look at Riusuke Fukahori - this Japanese artist is best known for his three-dimensional goldfish paintings created by pouring resin. His work is so inspirational, you will wish to try painting these fishes yourself! Only you will probably fail miserably as Fukahori's art is a hard thing to master - something you will come to see shortly.  Riusuke invented his unique way of painting during the year of 2002 - it was then he created his first goldfishes by pouring resin. It took him full eight years to master this way of painting and his first publication came in 2010. At that time, Fukahori knew what he wanted to do with his life, but that was not always the case. Originally, he desired to be a formative designer. He graduated at the Aichi Art University Department of Design in 1995 with flying colors. Riusuke started working, but the designer business wasn't anything as he imagined or hoped it to be. In 2000, his career hit a low point as he wasn't succeeding to make a deadline in time. While he was eating away at himself for not completing the tasks assigned to him, Fukahori glanced towards his pet goldfish as it swam in dirty water. Beeing so involved with work, Riusuke forgot to clean the tank and feed the fish for quite some time, but the little swimmer was still alive and well. Such resilience inspired Fukahori more than all the years spent at college and the distinct beautifulness of the goldfish surrounded by murky water was enough to make him realize he was wasting his life away on something he doesn't even love anymore. In an instant, his artistic side grew into an uncontrollable desire to depict goldfishes in all their beauty. Riusuke Fukahori calls this crucial moment of his life The Goldfish Salvation.    It took some time while Fukahori perfected his creative method. Fukahori didn't simply paint goldfishes - by altering between pouring resin into a vessel and painting with acrylic paint he started giving the resulting work a three-dimensional optical effect. Which brings us to the next aspect of Riusuke's art, the aforementioned vessels. Vessels are items on which he displays his goldfishes, which for him means the vessels can be almost anything he can get his hands on! Riusuke's depictions can be found inside many common household items of Japan, such as sushi okes and cypress sake cups. Of course, sometimes his work can get a bit too large to be fitted inside a cup, so that demands a bigger working ground, like giant paper surfaces and wooden planks, or even glass. Technically, Fukahori does a repetition of liquid resin pouring and acrylic painting. And as layer by layer resin rushes into the volumes and dries, he repeats his method until it finally gets the desirable three-dimensional effect. To say these fishes are realistically depicted would be an understatement - Fukahori prides himself with the fact his goldfishes have reached an optical point they seem not only real but actually present in front of you. This level of mastery Fukahori reached can be a linked to his studio which is notoriously filled with tanks full of goldfishes! He spends days upon days living beside and observing these animals, learning all he can about the little swimming creatures. Riusuke claims he never uses photographs of models for his work. Everything he paints comes directly from his memory and imagination. His innate fascination and infatuation with the swimming creatures aroused in him a creative preoccupation, studying, watching and understanding their movements in pursuit of recreating them as highly-realistic, near sculptural depictions.    Fukahori says his art is highly influenced by Claude Monet and the way he depicted water surfaces in his famous late 19th century series of Water Lillies. Sure, the French father of impressionism had a lot different approach to painting, but if we were to make a comparison with Riusuke we would be able to see some resemblances. There is also a darker theory that could be fueling Fukahori's art - his fishes could be all metaphors for the confinements of modern life. This makes sense when you realize that all of his goldfishes would not have any room to swim in their vessels if they were to suddenly come to life. But, ultimately, what drives this Japanese artist are his subjects. Such obsessions are not common, especially not when they last for years like in Fukahori's case. When asked about such an unusual source of inspiration, he replied: I’ve been depicting an uncountable number of goldfish in my work, but the mysterious pull towards goldfish will never die for me. The impulse of exploration - What are goldfish? - drives me to create more. Where and how they want to swim, and what they think; these are the questions that I’ve been asking myself when I paint goldfish. I believe this process will help breathe life into the goldfish in my works.   Commitment Fukahori shows his subjects is a real rarity in the modern art world as he has stayed true to them for his entire career. He made a unique connection to goldfishes and understands all about them. Unfortunately, since these animals have that notorious memory defect, they can not return the favor in that way; but what they can give Riusuke is an unlimited drive to create pieces of art that continue to amaze us. That seems like a fair deal. Riusuke owes everything to the forgotten fish he accidently saw in his apartment whilst working. As he states: I didn’t invent resin and not the first to use resin. I am not a resin artist. I am an artist saved by goldfish. I think there are people who try to imitate my work, but I believe that they fail at selecting the most appropriate vessel. The vessel in which the goldfish swim in is the key. They will never understand goldfish the way I do. They are only copying the craft, not the soul. The artist is represented by JOSHUA LINER GALLERY in New York.

The London Police,"The London Police is an art collaboration between Chaz Barrisson and Bob Gibson that started in 1998 when the artists visited Amsterdam to rejuvenate the visually disappointing streets of the drug capital of the world. The artists display an art in illustrative and innovative expression. They were part of a small group of artists at the end of the last century that helped pioneer a new street art movement. After a few years of mixing traveling and making art in the street, TLP began to receive worldwide recognition for their contribution to the graffiti/street art movement. They were included in many of the books documenting the scene and invited for shows and live drawing performances all over the globe. From 2002 onward TLP started sending missionaries into all corners of the globe. London policemen have come and gone but founding members are still known to walk the streets of every city in the world spreading the love with pens and stickers. Chaz Barrison draws the iconic “LAD”, a little smiley-face guy, that the crew is so well known for. The other half of the duo, Bob Gibson draws a tight portrait and architectural illustrations. In 2010 saw the return of Bob Gibson to The London Police after five years of touring with the indie band “MOSS”. And so the original founding members are re-embarking on their quest to combine making artwork and traveling the globe to better themselves and spread artistic love through the world.  The duo has managed to form a partnership more cohesive than Han Solo and Chewbacca in Star Wars and is continuing to produce slick artwork that is tighter than a butlers cuff. “Never be scared, don’t be a hero and let the good times roll.” is the artists' motto. As well as painting the London Police also enjoy making short films, photography, installations, and music. Their work has adorned buildings and galleries in more than 35 countries, like England, Holand, Singapore, Italy, Norway, Slovakia, USA, among others.",1984
Ekta,"Daniel Götesson aka Ekta is a Swedish contemporary artist born in 1978. He has a pretty individual style - huge fields of colors, often not separated by outlines, making obscure and mysterious, furthermore particularly abstract forms. At the age of 18 he moved to London with his best friend to skate and stayed there for 9 years. Art came through skateboarding and in some point became more important to him than skating. Ekta gratuaded from the London College of communication with a Bachelor degree in Graphic design and Illustration in 2004. After living in London for 9 years, Ekta relocated back to his native Sweden in 2005. Since then he has been very active on the Europe art scene. His murals can be found across the continent in Sweden, Poland and England, amongst other countries. He has recently worked on several public art commissions for various municipalities in Sweden. His work is not limited to street art but also includes sculptures in material such as concrete and wood. Aside his street work, Ekta does editorial illustrations and is frequently published in the New York Times. He has had eight solo shows in Europe as well as several group shows and was published in numerous international books and magazines including Modart, Denimzine, Faktum, Streetart Stockholm, Street Sketchbook, From Concrete to Canvas II. He has worked for international brands such as Nikita, Posten, Mattel. Currently Ekta is based in Gothenburg, Sweden.",1985
Carlos Estevez,"Carlos Estévez is one of the most prominent Cuban artists of his generation. Painter, sculptor and photographer, Estévez has been active for well over twenty years. He was born in 1969 in Havana, Cuba, and started studying art at a very early age, commencing at the 20th of October Elementary School of the Arts (Escuela Elemental de Artes Plásticas 20 de Octubre) in Havana, continuing to Havana's San Alejandro Academy of Fine Arts, and later to the Higher Institute of Art (ISA) also in Havana. Estévez works with a wide array of mediums, through which he embodies various philosophical and artistic concepts that explore the relationship between man and the universe, and often reflect Cuban social and political realities. His most recognizable paintings and drawings often feature Estévez's trademark, marionette puppets he creates using star-like dots connected with lines that create the mesmerizing effects of star constellations. Estevez’s visions transcend everyday experience, as if the bankruptcy of future utopias had forced him to create a realm of beliefs and knowledge anchored in the solid bastions of universal history, culture, and myth. His drawings and canvases have combined images of animals, human anatomy, and mechanical blueprints within the fixed grids of cartography. He does this by means of transparencies that recall treatises of esotericism, alchemy, acupuncture, or Da Vinci’s anatomical codices. “My main tools,” he has stated, “are metaphors of man’s existential questions, for instance, his power, his weakness, his essence, and his mission in the universe” Estévez has taken part in many artist residences such as the Félix González-Torres Community Art Project of the Florida International University in Miami, the Boston Arts Academy, the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris, France, the Sacatar Foundation in Salvador, Bahía, Brazil, the OMI International Arts Center, in New York, the UNAM (National Autonome University of Mexico) in Mexico, among others. He also held a number of solo and group exhibitions throughout his career. His work has been exhibited worldwide including National Museum of Fine Arts of Havana, Cuba, Los Angeles, Center of Contemporary Art in New Orleans, Switzerland, Paris, Japan, Spain, and VI and VII Havana Biennial, Cuba. In 2009 he had his first retrospective at UB Galleries, Buffalo University, NY. His work is part of collections such as the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana in Cuba, The Bronx Museum, Museum of Fine Art in Boston, and Miami Art Museum. Most recently he has shown his work at Lyle O’Reitzel Gallery in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Taylor Bercier Fine Art, New Orleans, Couturier Gallery, among many other locations around the world. He is currently living and working in Miami, Florida.",1986
Roberto Fabelo,"Roberto Fabelo is a widely known Cuban painter, illustrator and sculptor, and one of the most respected premier contemporary artists from Cuba. He is perhaps best known for his captivating artworks that depict nude woman with bird-like features, such as beaks and wings. Fabelo was born in 1950, Camagüey, Cuba and is a member of “the generation of sure hope” whose art was reinvigorated by the creative environment of the 1980s. A printmaker and an illustrator of many books, including those of Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez, and a creator of assemblages and installations, Fabelo received an award at the First Havana Biennial for Fragmentos vitales (Vital Fragments, 1984), a piece consisting of drawings done on irregularly cut Kraft paper and glued directly to the wall. Since then, his work has attained broader recognition from the art community in Cuba and abroad. As he cites, his influences are rooted in European art history: “Two great Spanish masters, Velázquez and Goya.” In contrast to compatriots like Rubén Alpízar or Reinerio Tamayo, who parody and subvert all references to the European canon, Fabelo’s emphatically modern consciousness is anchored in the trinity of style, authorship, and originality, notions that were reintroduced into contemporary Cuban art in the last decade by a revived interest in aesthetics and in traditional painting genres. Fabelo started doing watercolors in 1988 as a minor pursuit, but they have since assumed a more definite place in his artistic practice. With his increasing mastery of watercolor technique and exploration of larger formats, he has become the demiurge, or divine creator, of a world of his own. In it, he mixes Jonathan Swift’s acid humor, nocturnal denizens of the Moulin Rouge as immortalized by Toulouse-Lautrec, and the style of Spanish Baroque painting. Those cultural cross-currents give rise to a human comedy played out in a theatrical space. He juxtaposes the naturalistic depiction of characters with their staged and compact placement on a sofa or behind theatrical curtains. His deft hand captures each character in a defining gesture or attitude, and clothes him or her in a way that reveals the individual’s own psychology. The realistic appearance of those beings suggests that the artist is like a hunter of faces, stalking his prey in the corners of Havana. But this humanity, genetically tainted by tropical animals and fruits, deities, shy mermaids, feathered heads, is a faithful reflection of his imagination. Clustered on a sofa or gathered around props in an empty theater, his characters wait in awe for an event that will never happen. They seldom look at or talk to each other, and even the dogs share the same baleful glare as their owners. The juicy, Rubenesque nudes do not inspire lust or competition, but only add to the strangeness of the situation. Fabelo has been awarded with numerous awards, both national and international, and his remarkable pieces of art have been shown in more than 40 solo, and over 500 group shows, all around the world, including countries such as Switzerland, Japan, the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.

Tomas Sanchez,"One of the most renowned and expansive Cuban artists, Tomás Sánchez, is known for his lush landscapes that celebrate nature. Throughout his career, the artist has created works that feature two completely different themes: the mountings of garbage and tranquil forests and waterscapes. Inspired by the wilderness of Cuba and South America, his paintings explore the loss and the beauty of the environment. The detailed Surrealist landscapes the artist paints straight from his memory. Meditation has been a huge part of the creative process and has permeated his work and inspired it. Today, his work is part of numerous collections around the globe, including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Cuba, the Berardo Collection Museum, the University of Essex, the Toledo Museum of Art, and the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art. The artist was born in 1948 in Aguada de Pasajeros, Cuba, and later moved to Havana, where he enrolled in the National Academy of Fine Arts San Alejandro. In 1971 he graduated from National Art School (ENA) and was awarded by the National Exhibition of Arts the First Prize of Drawing for Young Artists. Unfortunately, during his studies at ENA, some thought his work was offensive and ""belittled human power"", and much of his paintings were destroyed. For three years Sánchez designed sets for the Teatro de Muñecos. In 1980 for the painting titled Desde Las Aguas Blancas, he won the prestigious International Prize of Drawing Joan Miró. The First Prize immediately brought him international recognition. In the 1980s, the artist was part of the Volumen Uno, one of Cuban history's most important art movements. The participants of the Uno shared the same goal and, together through their work, resisted the heavily censored regime. There is an ever-present contradiction in Sánchez's works, the inexplicable humankind's tendency to destroy nature, and the unbreakable bond we have with it. The spiritual power of the hyperreal tropical landscapes pouring out of his paintings brings to mind a paradise that is at once hopeful and threatening. Tomás Sánchez said: Influenced by the Romantics, the artist explores the relationship between spirituality, nature, and humanity in his works. The artist Sánchez most admires is Caspar David Friedrich and his philosophical approach to the contemplation of nature. Meditation for Tomás Sánchez is inseparable from his art. For the artist, the practice ""makes us feel connected to everything that exists."" It gives the person a feeling of being part of something bigger yet a whole. Thus often in his landscapes, there is a solitary person, tiny against the vastness and power of nature, trying to achieve the sense of one with the environment around it. In 1989 the artist left Cuba and permanently settled in Florida after a short time in Mexico. Tomás Sánchez lives and works in Costa Rica and Miami. ",1988
Monsieur Chat,"Discreet and unobtrusive, Monsieur Chat or M. Chat has been working on the streets since he was 15. His anonymity was broken in 2007 when he was caught painting his famous symbol – the cat. The man behind the mask was revealed to be Thoma Vuille, but he didn’t allow himself to be disturbed by this. Instead, he continued to exacerbate the already crystallized curiosity around the urban graphics of his increasingly present symbol. The shadow of his anonymous existence dispersed upon being shined on, but in the end, he realized that he and his alter ego are one and the same person, so he learned to drop the mask and raise his name alongside the signature of his alter ego. Believing in the idea and repeating it continuously over time, the artist got to the point where he was able to shape those around him in a way that, ultimately, the image he projects outwards is reflected back at him at times when he starts to entertain his own doubts about it.  Born in Boudry, in the canton of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, Chat began roaming the streets around 1987. He studied at the Institute of visual Arts of Orléans, graduating in 2001. In 1997, during one of the workshops, the grinning cat was born.  In his, now omnipresent symbol, the culture of the neighborhood meets the never-ending optimism of the artist, making a combination that is easily recognizable and widely famous. His dream of uniting human beings, different as they might be, is now possible. That single unifying subject has been found, and he's ever since on a mission of spreading that subject throughout the world. It was this kind of contagious optimism that nudged the film-maker Chris Marker into approaching the artist, and eventually making a documentary about him in 2004. Reflecting on France’s state after the 9/11, Marker used the phenomenon of the Chat’s cat to explore the sad feelings of the people, but to share some optimism as well. The attention was not focused on the artist, for once, as we do not need to know his personal history to be able to feel something upon seeing his work. In fact, the state of mind, or an attitude, or a philosophical aspiration, is represented through an image. Behind that image lies all the simplicity of a smile painted on a wall, and all the power that comes with it. Vuille keeps the drawing simple and the line clear. On the first sight, the cat looks like a logo. However, it can’t be reduced to a logo, as it’s so much more than that. Belonging to street art, it’s a character with a strong identity and many variations. A character that achieves a symbolic dimension through its simplicity.    Street art is highly unpredictable – where one sees inspirational pieces, others see the destruction of property. The artist had been previously arrested on brush in hand by the Police Municipal of Orléans in 2007. The Régie autonome des transports Parisian demanded 1,800 euros in damages, stating that Vuille had, without prior authorization, drawn inscriptions, signs or drawings, in the case of Cat Heads on the walls of the Châtelet-Les Halles station during its renovation in May 2014. Due to some contradictories, Vuille’s lawyer raised the invalidity of the notice of the artist, stating that he and his client were not completely sure what they were accused of. The court found the nullity of the summons, and the RATP finally asked one euro in damages, an amount incomparable to their previous requests. The whole thing turned out to be nothing more than a bad memory for Monsieur Chat, stating that he was not a criminal, but an artist. He also explained that his intention was to humanize a transit corridor, which was gray. All he did was putting some color on it, sharing happy feelings with all who passed nearby.   Vuille shows no signs of slowing down. In March of 2016, he came in Hong Kong, China to paint a mural on the Hotel Jen on Queen’s Road West. The piece is 13x13 meters and is one his biggest so far. As always, he intended to bring humor and humanity to Hong Kong with his creations. Once anonymous, Monsieur Chat was forced to reveal his identity in 2007, when he was arrested. Since then, he has come to embrace his public profile without expressing any regrets for his past actions. Looking forward instead of backward, he takes his responsibilities seriously. Being unmasked opened new doors for him, and he didn’t lose any of his energy that was originally behind the creation of the iconic Smiling Cat. He is represented by Galerie Brugier-Rigail and Galerie Onega. ",1989
Carlos Garaicoa,"Carlos Garaicoa is one of the internationally best known and most influential Cuban artists, whose work has achieved canonical status in his homeland. Born in 1967, Garaicoa first studied thermodynamics, but eventually turned to art when he enrolled, and later graduated at the renowned Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana. Curator, with Esterio Segura, of the important 1993 exhibition Las Metáforas Del Templo (Metaphors of the Temple), Carlos Garaicoa has created an exceptional body of work on the themes of architecture, ruins and utopia. From his initial subject, the city of Havana, he has moved on to New York, Cuito Cuanavale, Valencia, Minneapolis and Venice. Rívoli o El Lugar Donde Mana La Sangre (Rivoli, or The Place Where Blood Flows) was named after a piece of the same title, transformed into a light-box photograph in 2002. The earlier work included a photograph of the location and an architectural rendering. In complementary visions, the photo offered a dispassionate close-up of the building, reduced to its façade and knee-deep in detritus, while the drawing depicted a pyramid built on the roof, and a rivulet of blood trailing down the building’s surface. A handwritten text announced the drawing’s title, Proyecto Cruel (Cruel Project). This was an idea for a future performance, in which buckets of blood were to be thrown over the ruins. Throughout the Rivoli project, Garaicoa assumed the fictitious identity of an architect whose mission was to renovate and restore buildings on the point of collapse. The use of an imaginary creator and the photograph-drawing structure of the original piece also appear in his other projects of the time, such as Acerca De La Construcción De La Verdadera Torre De Babel (On the Construction of the Real Tower of Babel, 1994-95), Primer Sembrado De Hongos Alucinógenos En La Habana (First Cultivated Field of Psychedelic Mushrooms in Havana, 1997) and Proyecto Acerca Del Triunfo (Project on Victory, 1994-99). The grandiloquent solutions laid out in those drawings were demonstrably ineffective, absurd, and incoherent in practical terms. Their laudable purpose could not be transmuted into concrete action, instead, it was reduced to good intentions. The ruins became a record of utopian impotence. Rivoli is perhaps one of the works in which Garaicoa takes his farcical projects of urban sanitation to extremes. Conveyed by a fictitious creator, the artist’s message reveals several meanings simultaneously. Buildings such as the old Rivoli jeweler’s shop, protagonists of Garaicoa’s “impossible” projects, had been built, for the most part, during the early 20th century, the first decades of the Cuban republic. By the 1990s, they were crumbling, inexorably, under the weight of time and social indifference. As Piranesi had once done with Rome, Garaicoa congealed the mutilated buildings in their tragic grandeur, turning them into symbols of social anomie and the loss of faith in the overarching narrative of social emancipation. His appropriation of design language was harshly critical of the modern architect as a cultural figure, infused by utopian ideologies since the Bauhaus era, but incapable of protecting the historical “skin” of the city. The ironic tension between the two elements, project drawing and photographic representation, prevented any lapse into nostalgia, as it does in the 2002 light-box work, a temptation that Wim Wenders was unable to avoid as he portrayed a Havana “pierced by shadows” in his 1998 film, Buena Vista Social Club. Carlos Garaicoa currently lives and works between Havana and Madrid.  ",1990
Michael Sailstorfer,"A multidisciplinary installation artist from Germany, Michael Sailstorfer uses elements and objects from everyday life as the starting point for idiosyncratic experiments. Through his practice, constantly seeks to question and expand the classical notion of sculpture. Born 1979 in Velden/Vils, Lower Bavaria, he currently lives and works in Berlin. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and at Goldsmiths College in London where he got his MFA in 2004. He also participated in Villa Aurora Residency, Los Angeles, CA, International Studio Program, Office for Contemporary Art Norway, Oslo and CCA, Andratx, Mallorca. Sailstorfer primarily works in sculpture and installation, as well as painting, performance, photography, and film. He gives objects new meanings and functions by reconfiguring, though not deconstructing, them. Incorporating light, sound and smell into his installations and pushing his practice beyond physicality, he creates minimalistic and often absurd visions that poetically disrupt the everyday. Among his most celebrated pieces is an installation of a hanging car tire rotating in vain and rubbing against the wall without being able to get away, became renowned in 2005. As the tire wore down, rubber particles were collected on the floor and the scent of burning rubber filled the installation space. Michael Sailstorfer’s artistic position is to constantly question and expand the classical notion of sculpture. With his often elaborately produced works he puts the processes of daily life in unusual relationships towards each other. He incorporates light, sound and smell within his installations and pushes his practice beyond physicality thereby generating images of poetic power. His installation of a hanging car tire rotating in vain and rubbing against the wall  without being able to get away, became renowned in 2005. In doing so the tire abrades and spreads a typical pungent odor. He dedicated his first big solo exhibition 2012 in Berlin to the central theme of the forest. In the installation Forst (Forest), five upside down hanging trees which rotate slowly occupy the whole of the ten meter high exhibition space. In the same year Michael Sailstorfer was awarded the Vattenfall Contemporary 2012. His work has been shown in many solo and group exhibitions, in Paris, Berlin, Salzburg, Zurich, New York and Dubai, among others. Michael Sailstorfer lives and works in Berlin.",1991
Jonathan Monk,"Jonathan Monk is a British Contemporary artist who was born in Leicester in 1969. In his practice he replays, recasts and re-examines seminal works of Conceptual and Minimal art by variously witty, ingenious and irreverent means. Monk received a BFA from Leicester Polytechnic in 1988 and an MFA from Glasgow School of Art in 1991. Speaking in 2009, he said: “Appropriation is something I have used or worked with in my art since starting art school in 1987. At this time (and still now) I realized that being original was almost impossible, so I tried using what was already available as source material for my own work.” Through wall paintings, monochromes, ephemeral sculpture and photography he reflects on the tendency of contemporary art to devour references, simultaneously paying homage to figures such as Sol LeWitt, Ed Ruscha, Bruce Nauman and Lawrence Weiner, while demystifying the creative process. Monk is constantly asking “what next?” His stainless steel series entitled Deflated Sculpture, 2009, refigures Jeff Koon’s iconic balloon rabbit in various stages of collapse,  letting the air out isn’t an act of iconoclasm so much as giving the original idea new life. So too Monk documented the period he lived in Los Angeles with a series of photographs titled None of the Buildings on Sunset Strip (1997–99), showing only the roads between buildings – a follow up to Ed Ruscha’s artist book from 30 years before, all of the Buildings on Sunset Strip. But his conceptual configurations are also grounded in the personal: “what next?” takes on a poignancy in the slide projection In Search of Gregory Peck, 1997, where Monk brought together a collection of photographs taken by his late father in the 1950s, preceding him as a tourist in the US. Solo exhibitions include Centro De Arte Contemporáneo (CAC) Málaga, Kunstraum Dornbirn, Austria, Palais de Tokyo and Musee d’Art Moderne, Paris, Kunstverein Hannover, Institute of Contemporary Art, London and Museum Kunst Palast, Dusseldorf, among many others. His work has been included in numerous group exhibitions, including Whitney Biennial, Venice Biennales, Berlin Biennale, and Taipei Biennial. He was awarded the Prix du Quartier Des Bains, Geneva in 2012. Monk currently lives and works in Berlin.",1992
Irving Penn,"A renowned figure on both the commercial and fine art photography front, Irving Penn was an American artist whose long career marked a true milestone for the history of his chosen medium. His dramatic black and white imagery had a magical process of capturing portraits, still lifes and nudes in a way that the results would charm the viewers, mostly due to the enviable compositional balance. Furthermore, Penn was known for his technical precision that allowed him to get the absolute maximum out of his camera whatever the circumstances surrounding the shooting might be. Besides periodically photographing the streets, animal skulls and aging artists, Irving was primarily known for his fashion photography and images of celebrities and cultural icons. Whenever he was able to, Penn used natural light whilst he photographed his subjects[1], a feature that granted austerity, sophistication and tonal subtleties to his pictures.  Irving Penn was born on the 16th of June of the year 1917, in Plainfield, a part of the Union County, New Jersey, The United States. A new member of a Russian Jewish family, his parents' names were Harry Penn and Sonia Greenberg. Irving had a younger brother who was born in 1922, Arthur Penn - he would grow up and become a successful film director and producer. Arthur directed such cult icon movies as Little Big Man (1970) and Bonnie and Clyde (1967). Young Irving studied at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (now known as the University of the Arts) between the years of 1934 and 1938. There, he attended classes concerning the techniques of drawing, painting, graphics and industrial arts. One of his professors was Alexey Brodovitch. It was this teacher that opened the doors for Irving to start working for Harper's Bazaar as the famed magazine accepted a few of Penn's drawings that were later published. The aspiring artist worked as a freelance designer for two years before he took the Brodovitch's position as the art director at Saks Fifth Avenue in the year of 1940. Finding such work uninspiring, Irving quit his job at Saks Fifth Avenue a year later and spent some time painting and taking photographs in Mexico and across the United States. When he finally returned to New York City, Penn was offered a position as an associate in the Vogue Art Department by Alexander Liberman. Initially, he was in charge of working on the layout of the magazine, but after a while, Liberman asked him to try photography.[2]   Accepting the newly offered role, Penn's first photographic cover for the Vogue appeared during the October of 1943, in a time that the globe was being swallowed up by the flames of World War II. Irving continued to work at this magazine throughout his career, regularly photographing covers, portraits, still lifes, fashion sessions and producing photographic essays[3]. He met the fashion model Lisa Fonssagrives at a photo shoot in 1947, almost instantly falling in love. A few years later, the two married at the Chelsea Register Office and soon had a son together. By that time, Penn was already very famous for his fashion photography and ethnographic pictures he took around the world. In the early portion of the 1950s, Penn established his own studio in New York City and began making advertising photographs for a chosen clientele. There, he was also able to work on his modernist approaches to composing photos, experimenting with still lifes of food, bones, bottles, metal and found objects. At the top of his game, there was not a single gallery or a journal that did not want to have at least a single portrait made by this photographer. Irving never stopped making photographic travel essays as this was obviously a big passion for the author[4]. He never ceased experimenting as well, always seeking new ways that may give his art some new depth, ability or meaning. Interestingly, Penn was among the first photographers to model subjects against a simple gray or white backdrop as he soon became a master at using this kind of simplicity. Many of his most notable subjects were photographed this way, including the likes of Martha Graham, Marcel Duchamp, Georgia O'Keeffe, W. H. Auden and Igor Stravinsky. The next decades of the artist's life were all dedicated to making photos, regardless of how old he was or how tired he felt. Penn died at the age of 92, on the 7th of October in 2009. He was at his beloved home in Manhattan.    When Irving Penn's long career finally came to an end, everyone that remained behind were sure of one thing - that this American author can easily be considered to be one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century. And, in all honesty, it's quite hard to disclaim this case. When all was said and done, Penn photographed a multitude of important writers, visual artists and cultural figures that are all vital to our modern culture and history. Irving placed such figures in front of his camera as Jasper Johns, Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico, John Cage, Truman Capote and Louise Bourgeois. He was also in charge of producing images for Vogue, Chanel and other major fashion giants, all of which considered the American to be an elite employee, and managed to capture the very spirit of living in the 20th-century regardless of the geographical location[5]. Furthermore, Penn's technical supremacy and compositional style left a real tribute to today's practitioners that work had at investigating and staying true to Irving's black and white images.

Yang Maoyuan,"Born in 1966, in Dalian, China, Yang Maoyuan is a highly regarded artist well known for his large and diverse body of work encompassing painting, sculpture, photography and installation. Yang’s works often express his understanding on the sources of culture and the core of life, the theme he most interested in is how Art generated the inner power that could adapt with its Time, and how an individual artist express this inner power by his/her own way. He received his BA degree in Engraving from Central Academy of Fine Arts of China in 1989. Since 1994, Yang Maoyuan has entered the deep heart of Taklamakan Desert and Lop Nur (the most mysterious area in the Silk Road) for two times. Facing the wonders of aeolian sand dunes and barren lands, Yang Maoyuan was totally won over by the supreme power of nature. By explore in the remains of ancient Loulan city, whose demolishment is still a mystery, the disappeared civilization inspired Yang’s magnificent imagination. The experience of these explorations later became the spine of his art creation. Since 1995, earth and man appears in Yang’s paintings repeatedly as a main object, dark blue sky, golden-yellow earth, and giant human body embedded with the earth, evoke extremely strong visual effect and aesthetic emotion. Around 2000, Yang Maoyuan made inflatable sculpture Horse and Sheep. He made inflating balls with hides of horse and sheep, in which original forms of animal are eliminated intentionally by the author, conveying a certain bizarre and arcane force. “Inflation” could be taken as a metaphor of the deepest aches of the people and the society in China. In the same time, inflation and roundness could also be deciphered as recurring, powerful and everlasting life process. In Yang Maoyuan’s outlook, roundness means harmony and ideal in Chinese culture, the horse is inflated and rounded, means it is idealize as a harmonious entirety. The co-existence of “the ache of inflation” and the “harmony of roundness” make Horse and Sheep complicated and self-conflicting wholes, for which give the viewers great impact, is the most uncannily unspeakable and most feeling-arousing element of these art works. As an ultimate form of substances in the world, “roundness” digests the original forms of horse and sheep, gives them a freaky culture-aroused feeling. Inflatable horse and sheep represents Yang’s posture towards art: through the use of the psychology concept archetype, he out-emerge the pedigree and uniqueness of his art thoughts, makes his works distinctive in modern arts, so their originality is strengthened. After Horse and Sheep, this kind of usage of roundness and the technique of dissolution used in his Look Inside sculpture series. Inspired by the culture thoughts of western from Classic Period to the Age of enlightenment, Yang Maoyuan developed a unique way of sculpting. He cited the concept of beauty from the western culture, only for questioning it. To counter the western discourse, Yang grinded and polished all the edges and details of western classical sculptures, reinterpreted them with the inner looking eastern culture views, expressed the philosophical idea of “roundness is harmony”. In Yang’s resent paintings, he evolves early experience of journey in central Asia, which inspired his explorations on time and space, constantly conveys another form of the light. From sunrise to sunset, in every moment, there is certain light-temperature, which corresponding to a color in the spectrum. Yang measures the light-temperature from dawn to dust day by day for several years, draws down the corresponding colors on paper, and has accumulated a massive and precious light-temperature database. Draw with light-temperature, could be seen as a metaphor of the thought of time everlasting and circulating, and world recurring. By all the works mentioned above, Yang Maoyuan strives to establish an attitude that could correspond to the identity of local culture and the artist himself. In 1989 he participated the ground-breaking Modern Art Grand Show of China. Yang won the CCAA modern art of China prize in 2002. His art works have been exhibited in Beijing, Shanghai, Paris, Berlin, Dresden, London, Florence, Genoa, Warsaw, among others. The galleries and museums that have exhibited Yang's art works including The National Museum of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Pompidou Center, Dresden Art Center, Today Art Museum, Martin-Gropius-Bau Museum, Erdos Art Museum, Padua Villa Breda Museum, Medici Riccardi Palace, etc. His art works are favored by public and private collectors. In 2011, as the representative of Chinese artists, Yang Maoyuan took part in the exhibition in China Pavilion of Venice Biennale. He currently lives and works in Beijing, China.   ",1994
Mantis,"Mantis is a South African born artist who has been a steady contributor to the urban and contemporary art scene for the last ten years. He has exhibited numerous times with some of the top contemporary and urban art galleries across the world: Los Angeles, Miami, Australia, Bangkok, Berlin, Italy and London, where he is currently based.

He currently lives and works as a prop maker in London while continuing to produce his own work.",1995
Gregory Crewdson,"The peculiar photographic opus of Gregory Crewdson is inclined in the mysteries behind the porch or closed doors of idealized American suburban homes. Namely, the inhabitants of these homes are dealing with anxiety, manias, and are usually found in some rather bizarre situations. Similar to the  illustrious and ephemeral motion pictures aesthetics, the photographs of Crewdson represent the other kind of reality. At the same time, his works are a cynical comment on the mythomania and common places of representation.   Gregory Crewdson was born in 1962, in Park Slope, a neighborhood in Brooklyn. He attended John Dewey High School, graduating early and as a teenager was part of a punk rock group called The Speedies. Interestingly, their hit song Let Me Take Your Foto  anticipated what would Crewdson become later in life. Soon after, he received a BA from the State University of New York at Purchase in 1985 and an MFA in photography from Yale in 1988. Also, Gregory Crewdson has taught at Sarah Lawrence, Cooper Union, Vassar College and Yale University where he works as a professor at present.    Therefore, it is not surprising that Crewdson's bizarre photographs are usually taken in American small towns. The very choice of the theme seems to lay in the two presumptions. The first one is the picture of idealized home inherited from the consumerism, especially the mechanism of affluent society of the 50’s, and the other one being the critique of American babbitry. As a matter of fact, the artist is articulating states of loneliness, alienation, apathy, resignation, mystery, identity, desire, memory and imagination throughout the works of Gregory Crewdson. The dystopic landscapes are not narratives as such since they are just a fragments handed to the observer to solve them like a puzzle.    The photographs of Gregory Crewdson are elaborately staged and lit using crews familiar with motion picture production and lighting large scenes using motion picture film equipment and techniques. The artist carefully captures the moments of disconnect through the portraits of people lost in thought, isolated and inaccessible, both to each other and to the viewer. The final result is almost perfect – the colors are rather accentuated, the composition is balanced right. Exactly that contrast of technical perfection and highly dramatic atmosphere captured is the main quality of Crewdson’s work.    The influence of motion pictures in Crewdson’s work is notable, so the references to certain movies are present. The artist has cited that the films Vertigo, The Night of the Hunter, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Blue Velvet, and Safe  had the huge impact on him, while the atmosphere on the paintings of Edward Hopper, photographs of Diane Arbus, Cindy Sherman and surrealism moved him greatly. Perhaps, the most important influence can be traced in the work the great Italian director Federico Fellini who shot most of that film on the sets at Cinecittà studios in Rome. It is no coincidence that Crewdson, on his first overseas film shoot, shot the series Sanctuary at the very same location. Apparent fascination is also present in his photographs in the series Beneath the Roses which are a cynical American form of famous Fellini's film Dolce Vita.   One of his most famous series under this title is located in anonymous townscapes. The photographs depict strange situations of forest clearings, desolate streets and house interiors as sites of the enigma. On a stormy night, a man in a business suit stands beside his car, holding out a hand to the cleansing rain in apparent mystification, while a woman is sitting still next to her newborn in a house with open doors. The scenes are atmospheric and provoking and can be read differently. The coordinates of time and place are erased, so the post-catastrophic associations are inevitable.    The latest series titled  Cathedral of the Pines is named after a rural trail near Gregory Crewdson’s home in Massachusetts, a converted Methodist church and firehouse. The site where he found the inspiration to make these new pictures inspired him greatly with its lurk and dark atmosphere. The photographs are accompanied by an essay by Alexander Nemerov, who addresses the work in relation to the American past, focusing in particular on the way the images draw space and time down to ceremonial points.    During the years, the artist has received numerous awards including the Skowhegan Medal for Photography, the National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artists Fellowship and the Aaron Siskind Fellowship. Crewdson has published several books of his photographs including Hover with ArtSpace Books, Dream of Life with the University of Salamanca, Spain, Twilight and Beneath the Roses with Abrams and a Retrospective book of his work, entitled Gregory Crewdson from 1985 to 2005. In 2012, he was the subject of the feature documentary film Gregory Crewdson: Brief Encounters. The whole opus of Gregory Crewdson is committed to examining The American middle-class nightmare through hyper-realist stylizations. Despite the works being reminiscent of cinema and even fashion editorials, their concise socially charged agenda makes them profoundly deep and of high artistic quality.  ",1996
Leonora Carrington,"Painting is a need, not a choice [1], said the legendary painter and novelist Leonora Carrington, who managed to completely redefine female symbolism through her own interpretation of surrealism. She was a restless and prolific artist throughout her career – she worked in oil painting, bronze and cast iron sculpture, but also mixed-media pieces that combined wood, glass, and various iron objects. Besides her important role in the history of surrealism, Carrington was also known as a romantic partner of another prominent surrealist, Max Ernst. The two of them shared their dream worlds and symbolic universes through their magnificent artworks. Carrington has also rejected the surrealist ideal of woman as the main source inspiration and she turned to novel realms such as the animal world, the occult, and Celtic mythology.  Leonora Carrington was born in 1917 and she was originally from Clayton Green in Lancashire, England. Her parents were quite wealthy, so young Leonora has received an excellent education from specially assigned tutors and nuns. However, her nature was rebellious and it was impossible for her parents to control her – she ended up being expelled from multiple schools. Eventually, Carrington was sent to Florence, Italy, where she attended Mrs. Penrose's Academy of Art. Afterwards, she moved to London, where she attended the Ozenfant Academy for three years. One of the most decisive moments in Carrington’s younger years happened in 1927,  when she saw a surrealist painting at the Left Bank Gallery. Later on, she happened to meet many surrealist painters, including the famous Paul Éluard. Leonora’s father opposed his daughter's career as a painter, while her mother encouraged her. Carrington, who was a natural-born rebel, decided to trust only her own instincts, which led her to deep and passionate dedication to surrealism.   The young artist became familiar with surrealism thanks to Herbert Read's book, called Surrealism, from 1936. This book was given to Leonora by her mother, who decided to support her daughter’s unstoppable artistic imagination. Young Leonora was impressed by surrealist ideas and she shared their curiosity about the unconscious mind and dream imagery. However, she didn’t want to copy the already existing aesthetics; instead, she infused her own ideas and interests, revolving around a unique blend of cultural influences, Celtic literature, renaissance painting, American folk art and even medieval alchemy and popular Jungian psychology. Thanks to these bizarre multiple influences, Carrington's art is full of half-human half-animal hybrid figures or imaginary beasts. Through this brave and challenging imagery, the painter explored important and universal themes, such as transformation and sexual identity. Carrington never stereotyped women as objects of male sexual desire and she focused on the depiction of contact and interaction between women of various ages.   In 1937, Carrington met the German painter Max Ernst, another key figure of the Surrealist movement. The two of them fell in love and formed a strong bond, beyond typical romantic relationship. They lived and worked together in Paris and supported each other's artistic ideas and vision. They also created a couple of collaborative pieces they used to embellish their home. Unfortunately, Max Ernst was arrested by the Nazis while he was living in France; consequently, Carrington had to move to Spain. Due to her anxiety and fears related to Ernst’s situation with the Nazis, she suffered a mental breakdown and ended up being institutionalized. Her experience in the mental hospital catalyzed her career as a writer and many of her written and visual works were produced after she was released from the hospital, such as her novel Down Below from 1972 and her paintings Portrait of Dr. Morales from 1940 and Map of Down Below from 1943. When it comes to Max Ernst and his career, he was discharged from the Nazi prison thanks to the help of Paul Éluard and other friends. But soon after the Nazis invaded France, he was arrested again by the Gestapo, who considered his art to be ""degenerate"". Ernst couldn’t stand being imprisoned again and he managed to escape to America with the help of Peggy Guggenheim. Meanwhile, Carrington’s mental health was getting worse and has reached the final breakdown at the British Embassy in Madrid. She was given a strong therapy by her doctors – she was treated with both cardiazol, a powerful anxiolytic drug, and luminal, a barbiturate.   After being hospitalized for a while, Carrington decided to run away and seek refuge in the Mexican Embassy. In the same period, Ernst married Peggy Guggenheim in New York in 1941. Even though their marriage was a short affair and it ended a couple of years later, Ernst and Carrington didn’t resume their relationship. One of the reasons for this was Carrington’s problematic mental health. Yet, despite her many troubles and chaotic state of mind, Leonora became well-known painter practically overnight. One of her early exhibitions was held at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York, where she was the only professional female exhibitor who showcased her ground-breaking pieces. She has gained even more international recognition when her painting entitled the Juggler, from 1954, set a new record as the most expensive work ever sold by a surrealist painter. Carrington lived and worked in Mexico after spending early 1960s prevalently in New York City and rarely came back to her home in Lancashire, London. When she moved to Mexico in 1963, she was asked to create a mural, which she eventually named the Magical World of the Mayas. This large-scale panoramic mural was influenced by Mexican folk stories and it is now located in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City.   Starting from the early 90s, Carrington began dividing her residence between Mexico City, New York and Chicago. Around the same time, she also began producing various bronze sculptures , representing animals and humans. She also continued making paintings, prints, and drawings and she used to give interviews about her life and career, since the press was still curious about her activities. Leonora Carrington died in May 2011 in Mexico City due to pneumonia. She was 94 years; she has lived a long and accomplished life. Carrington’s role in the internationalization of surrealism was truly important, in terms of her artistic practices that introduced new elements to this movement. Leonora has written a series of texts about her own surrealist theory in the years following World War II and even though she is frequently overshadowed by her association with Ernst, Carrington's work has received even more public attention than Ernst’s in the 21st century. [2] Her approach is deemed visionary and strongly personal, while her symbolism is considered entirely new and authentic. The relationship between Carrington's writing and her paintings is another topic that has been popular among many art critics and scholars. The same goes for an important role in feminism in the new analysis of Carrington's art. The scholars claim that Carrington's highly personal visual expression which combines folklore and magic led the way aspiring female artists who wanted to explore new ways of addressing and portraying female identity.   During her long and successful career, Carrington was a truly eclectic artist. She wasn’t dedicated only to painting and sculpture; she published many novels, short stories, and dramas. She was simultaneously involved in theatre, movies, and tapestry design. Thanks to the enviable quality of her work, her pieces now belong to numerous private and public collections, including the prestigious National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago and the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. It is interesting to note that Carrington, unlike many of her fellow surrealists, wasn’t interested in the psychological theory of Sigmund Freud. She stayed focused on magical realism, symbolism and alchemy and used autobiographical detail rather than theories on the power of our subconscious. She was also interested presenting female sexuality in a different way - her work in the 1940s highlighted the women’s role in the artistic process. For instance, her famous work from 1938, entitled Self-Portrait, offers a unique interpretation of female sexuality - Leonora has moved away from the common characterization of female sexuality subverted to the dominant male role. The same artwork, Self-Portrait, also offers insight into Carrington’s curiosity when it comes to alchemy and transformation of matter and living entities. The hyena depicted in this work combines male and female traits into a whole, which was a novel idea in the era this work was created. Carrington often used to paint horses and write stories about them, which is rooted in her childhood fascination with horses. For example, in her first published short story, entitled the House of Fear, Carrington portrayed horse in the human role of a psychic guide. Generally speaking, Carrington often used codes and her own secret language in order to describe certain terms and to enable the interpretation in her mysterious artworks. It is known that Candlestick was her code for family and family issues, while the word Lord signified her father. El Juglar from 1954 is another Carrington’s famous work. This dreamy landscape is filled with horses, imaginary creatures and occultist motifs, and every element had a personal value for her. When it comes to collaborations, the most famous one is with fellow female surrealist Remedios Varo.   The debut exhibition of young Leonora happened in 1947, when she was invited to showcase her early pieces at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York City. She was asked to show her work in an international exhibit of surrealism, where she turned out to be the only female British artist. This experience has launched her career and she became a true celebrity. Later on, when she moved to Mexico, she published several books. Her breakthrough in UK happened with an exhibition in Chichester's Pallant House Gallery, West Sussex, from 17 June to 12 September 2010. This exhibition was a part of a number of international exhibitions titled Surreal Friends which celebrated the part women took in the Surrealist movement. Beside Carrington’s work, there were also art pieces made by her friends, the Spanish painter Remedios Varo and the Hungarian photographer Kati Horna. In 2013, the biggest retrospective of her work so far was presented at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, the title was The Celtic Surrealist and Sean Kissane through Carrington's Irish background presented many social, cultural and political elements that can be found in her work. In 2005, Carrington's piece The Juggler was auctioned with a starting price at US$713,000 at Christie’s. It set a new record as an art piece with the highest price set for a living surrealist painter. Carrington also did portraits of many actors, such as Enrique Álvarez Félix, son of actress María Félix. In 2015, Eleonora Carrington was honored by Google doodle for her 98th birthday. The subject of the doodle was her surrealistic painting, How Doth the Little Crocodile. This painting was inspired by a poem from the renowned writer Lewis Carroll and his book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Also, this piece was turned into Cocodrilo located on Paseo de la Reforma. The last big exhibition of Carrington’s work took place in 2013 at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, entitled the Celtic Surrealist.   I didn't have time to be anyone's muse... I was too busy rebelling against my family and learning to be an artist, [3] said Carrington who died in 2011, leaving behind a huge legacy. Through her work she didn’t just prove herself as a true surrealistic artist, but also as a remarkable individual. Her life was full of turbulent events – from the romance with Max Ernst to the escape from the Nazis, mental illness, and expatriate life in Mexico. Almost all of her dreamy and highly detailed art has strong personal symbolism. The remarkable creatures set in some other worlds were made based on Carrington’s experiences and psychotic episodes. Nevertheless, she never liked to explain this mystique. Despite the lack of explanation, the visual appeal was more than enough for her to get widely appreciated. Leonora Carrington lived and worked between the United States and Mexico. References:  ",1997
Daido Moriyama,"A prolific Japanese artist, well-known as a photographer, graphic designer, and writer, Daido Moriyama has epitomized wabi-sabi, the Japanese aesthetic of finding beauty in imperfection. The most celebrated photographer to emerge from the Japanese Provoke movement of the 1960s, Moriyama is best known for confrontational, black-and-white images depict the contrast of traditional values and modern society in postwar Japan. Born in 1938 in Ikeda City, Osaka, Japan, Moriyama currently lives and works in Tokyo. He studied photography at the Takeji Iwamiya studio in Osaka before moving to Tokyo in 1961 to meet the members of VIVO. He became an assistant to Eikoh Hosoe, gaining access to the Tokyo photo world through this position. In his signature gritty style, Daido Moriyama often captured the breakdown of traditional values in post-war Japan during the American occupation of the country. His works allude to the struggle between tradition and modernism, capturing the social and cultural shifts and conflicts, industrialization, urbanization and the clash of capitalism with a traditionally insular society. Regarded as a master of technique, Moriyama creates distinct grainy and high contrasted images in black and white, often allowing for photographic chance.",1998
Mona Kuhn,"Mona Kuhn is an artist known for large-scale photographs of nudes. Kuhn chose the nude as the focus of her work because it represents a timeless canon and she was interested in the idea of the body as residence. She describes her visual vocabulary as figurative, however recent works have begun explorations with abstraction. Mona Kuhn was born in 1969 in São Paulo, Brazil and is of German descent. She received her BA from The Ohio State University and went on to study fine art at the San Francisco Art Institute. Mona Kuhn’s photographs of nudes aim to show the human body in its most natural state. Stripping away the distraction of material adornment, her subjects become timeless and free from cultural and/or generational stereotypes. Working intimately with a group of friends, she considers each photograph a collaboration. The subjects’ postures mirror their environments and each series flows like a lyrical ballad, opening up a dialogue about the human body’s interaction with the setting. Classically trained, Kuhn’s compositions are painterly studies, each photograph thoughtfully arranged. Each image is multi-dimensional with a careful selective focus, giving the viewer the opportunity to only enter specific areas of the frame and leaving the remainder up to the imagination. Kuhn's first monograph titled „Photographs” was published by Steidl in 2004. “Photographs” was followed by Evidence in 2007, which was accompanied with a short story by Frederic Tuten. Her next project, released in 2010, was a return to her homeland of Brazil, with a series titled Native and an accompanying monograph of the same name published by Steidl. In 2011, Kuhn released Bordeaux Series, also with a monograph published by Steidl, which is a collection of traditional portraits and landscapes. Her work has been described as ""intimate and sensuous,"" ""dreamlike"" and ""classical"" in composition. In a 2013 interview with ARTnews, Kuhn compared her process with childbirth, saying of the completion of a project that “When you feel that you are ready, you want to separate from it. You can’t take it anymore, and you have to push it out. And once it’s out, it takes on a life of its own Her work is in private and public collections worldwide, including The J. Paul Getty Museum, California; George Eastman House Museum, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas; Musée de l'Elysée, Switzerland; Musée de la Photographie de Charleroi, Belgium and many more. Steidl has published four monographs of Kuhn’s work to date, Photographs (2004), Evidence (2007), Native (2009), and Bordeaux (2011). Her newest monograph, Private, also published by Steidl, will be released in the Fall 2014. Kuhn currently lives and works in Los Angeles and is an independent scholar at The Getty Research Institute.",1999
Maxim Mamsikov,"Maxim Mamsikov is an Ukrainian contemporary painter, who has adopted and modified photorealist style, depicting everyday life, people and objects as fragments of collective memory. Mamsikov was born in Kiev in 1968, where he attended Shevchenko Secondary School of Arts. He graduated from the Kyiv State Academy of Fine Arts, Graphic Department, in 1994. In 1999, he was a resident at the Art Academy in Munich. As an artist, Maxim Mamsikov is interested in everyday life most of all. However, his interpretation of the genre does not mean a simple life-likeness. His paintings are rather fit into the latest trend of certain post-media realism based on the mechanism of paradoxical psychological compensation – the further away from reality you go, the more insistently you cling to its semblances. Mamsikov is trying to show and hide at the same time, filling the image with mysterious senses and emotional vibrations. Placed in celestial void, particular familiar things gain some new, otherworldly meanings, setting the tone for a sense of dark, unspoken social trauma - a theme that seems to run rife through today's Ukrainian art. His images often resemble a collection of random images with blurred focus, as if with the effect of shaking camera, reminiscent of the panoramic shot, taking as its subject the isolation of a lonely winter cityscape or deserted seaside. Maxim Mamsikov offers the viewer a certain extract of reality, transferring his immediate impressions into laconic stories. Showing only fragments, he pulls them out of their time. Mamsikov’s series entitled Pocket Art is a collection of small or even miniature works. These images are unelaborated, fragmentary, and in lack of didactics, depicting players in the pitch, lovers on the lawn, a pack of Belomor cigarettes, a tank in snow, a plane taking off, a skier, Gagarin, birches. The language of these works is an intriguing game on the verge of reality and light unobtrusive dreams, while the tachisme-like Color Proof project contains almost equal amounts of the abstract and the hyper-realistic, gaining vectors in the direction of experiments with the pure essence of painting. In Aeroflora series he is interested not in people but in objects. It's a colorful, infantile world, with huge inflatable toys floating in the blue sky. The intensity of the bright, pure colors and almost a designer construction of the canvas give birth to poetics close to psychedelics of pop culture and visual effects of pop art. Mamsikov’s work has been featured in group and solo exhibitions across Ukraine, Russia and other parts of Europe. He was the winner of the All-Ukrainian competition of young artists Start in the Visual Arts in 2003. The artist lives and works in Kiev.   ",2000
Hong Hao,"  Hong Hao is a Contemporary photographer from Beijing. His work reflects his careful observational skills and wit demonstrated through his art. Hong was born in Beijing in 1965. He attended the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, where he studied in the Printmaking Department, and has been exhibited internationally since 1988. After graduating in 1989, Hong created his first major series, a group of prints resembling Chinese maps, executed with a remarkable attention to detail. The artist began working with photography in 1999, and, in 2001, began his most well-known series, My Things. Hong Hao is a highly independent artist, not forming part of any school. His work is innovative, astute and satirical. Much of his work deals with illusion, appearance and preconception. He has spent many years working on a book of maps, called the Scriptures, that reshapes the world according to different forces. For example one map, New World Order, shows the world rearranged geographically and the names of large corporations used to name the countries. Another redistributes land mass according to military and economic strength. Another replaces the names of capital cities with popular expressions or words, yet another shows nuclear arms stationed in selected sites the world over. Hong Hao's intent is to confuse and thus challenge orthodox perceptions. One of Hong Hao's best known photographic series, ""My Things"", opened up a new realm of personal expression for the artist. The photographs are composed of thousands of scanned images of objects from his own life. These commonplace things are arranged by the artist using a computer. There is no traditional photo taken by a camera. The objects are shown life size and some represent over 20 years of accumulation on the part of the artist while others could have been part of that day's lunch. These micro universes, from afar like satellite photos, close up invite a moment of intimacy, a glimpse into the life of the artist, a discovery of contemporary China and a chance to pick out what we would find in our own homes. Hong’s work has been featured in many group and solo shows around the world, and has been collected by leading arts institutions. Hao currently lives and works in Beijing.

Kohei Nawa,"Kohei Nawa is a famous Japanese artist who uses glass beads, prisms, glue, plaster, and spray foam to cover found objects, such that their original contours become variously distorted and magnified. Nawa was born in 1975, in Osaka. Kohei Nawa received his BFA, MFA, and Ph.d. in Fine Arts from the Kyoto City University of Art. He is currently the Assistant Professor in Department of Fine Art at Kyoto University, and the director of the platform SANDWISH, a production house for art, design and architecture. Kohei Nawa is acclaimed for his PixCell series, which is a word that integrates ‘pixel’, which demonstrates digital image resolution, and the biological ‘cell’. While the subject in each work connotes its own attributes such as weight, smell and color, its essence is lost or distorted through the production process in which glass, crystal and urethane coats covers its surface. PixCell-Deer, the representative work of the PixCell series, is the most celebrated work from the BEADS series that cover taxidermied animals with clear crystal beads. The artist explains that through this process, “the existence of the object itself is replaced by ‘a husk of light’, and the new vision, ‘the cell of an image,’ is shown.” Fittingly his most recent series is titled “PixelCell” (2009-), for which the artist has used taxidermy animals, including deer, cheetahs, rabbits, and coyotes. Nawa has also founded an artist collective space dubbed “Sandwich,” through which he takes on mutli-disciplinary design projects. In 2011, he was approached by Rei Kawakubo to design headwear for Comme des Garcons’ Spring/Summer 2012 runway show. Having launched his artistic career in 1999, Nawa has participated in various group exhibitions including a show at SCAI The Bathhouse in 2004, Galerie Kashya Hildebrand in Switzerland in 2008, The Ueno Royal Museum in 2009, and Saatchi Gallery in London in 2010. Nawa currently lives and works in in Kyoto, Japan.   ",2002
Carl Andre,"Evolution doesn’t necessarily mean more complexity. Sometimes a step forward corresponds with making things simpler. Carl Andre is an American artist, who reached an original and extreme position and was able to defend it through his intelligence and strong will. While sculpture in the past has been known for its finite form, he modified that definition, striving for a three-dimensionality that depended on the unattached organization of modular elements in a predetermined configuration, which is often a grid rather than a finite fixed immutability. His working-class experiences influenced his choice of materials – there are wood, bricks, metal, rubber truncated pyramids and Styrofoam blocks. Another interpretation of this choice revolves around the criticism of contemporary architecture and its eccentric, over-designed, pretentious facades and expensive, exotic materials.   Born in Quincy, Massachusetts, Andre obtained his primary and secondary education in the public school system of his hometown, before studying art at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA, where he spent three years, from 1951-1953. During studies, he became acquainted with Hollis Frampton. After spending a year in the US Army, Andre moved to New York in 1956, where Frampton introduced him to Constantin Brâncuși through whom Andre became re-acquainted with a former classmate from Phillips Academy, Frank Stella, in 1958. For five years, between 1960 and 1965, the artist worked freight brakeman and conductor in New Jersey and focused all of his free time on writing poetry. In this period, he didn’t make sculptures, and yet, the blue-collar experiences heavily influenced his subsequent art and life - all of the materials he uses can be found in construction; It was common for Andre to dress in overalls and a blue work shirt, even when he attended the most formal occasions.[1] To fully understand the work of Carl Andre, a closer look at his relationships with other artists is necessary. Frampton played a great role – not only did he inspire Andre’s radical position and approach to sculpture through their conversations about art[2], he also introduced him to Brâncuși and through the Romanian artist, he became re-acquainted with Frank Stella, whom he knew from the Phillips Academy. Initially inspired by Brâncuși, Andre took another direction after sharing a studio with Stella for two years and learning about space from him. In 1985, Andre married Ana Mendieta, a Cuban artist who died the same year, under still unclear circumstances.    Common sculpture usually confronts the spectator with the traditional abstraction that mirrors the viewer’s own upright body – Carl decided to challenge this verticality. His accumulations of untransformed materials are organized horizontally, forcing the viewers to look down, not straight ahead or even up, as colossal public sculpture forces them to do. Without seeking to engulf the spectators, the sculptor is simply marking off his turf, asking for respect rather than intimacy. Provisionality is the common feature of Andre’s work – it exists as sculpture only at the time it is exhibited. Our knowledge of its precarious and temporary state, as well as our sense that the works can easily revert to their ordinary function, is part of their elusive content. Given its dual identity of being and potentially not being, Andre's work clearly has a strong conceptual element, even though he was making it as far back as 1960, before conceptual art became a popular mind game.[3] He claims no spiritual dimension with his art – without adhesive, organized whether as sculpture or mutely stacked, his pieces maintain their identity as untransformed matter, thus proving Andre's contention that he is a pure materialist. But not without ambiguity, which is why they maintain their tension and fascination. This type of materiality can also be interpreted as conceptual, making him, as stated above, one of the earliest conceptual artists. And yet, he considers this as false. The very substance of his work comes from the characteristics of every unit of material he selects, and the arrangement and position of the sculpture in its environment - it is not merely the realization of an idea.    Simply said, Carl Andre reduced sculpture to its essential state. And while he saw this as an end-point in his process, many others used it as a starting point in their own respective careers, making the American minimalist artist and his sculptures an important reference point for many subsequent artists. He defined the nature of Minimalist style with other giants such as Robert Morris, Eva Hesse, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, and Sol LeWitt. His work was exhibited (both in solo and group shows) at some of the most prestigious institutions around the world, including the Tate Gallery in London, Paula Cooper Gallery in NY, Ace Gallery in LA, Guggenheim Museum and Museum of Modern Art in NY, Museum Wiesbaden in Germany, Museum of Modern Art in Vienna, and many more. Arguably, Carl’s most significant contribution was to distance sculpture from processes of carving, modeling, or constructing, and to make works that simply involved sorting and placing. Carl Andre lives and works in New York.  References:  ",2003
Dan Flavin,"After struggling for years to find the appropriate medium for his artistic expression, Dan Flavin was finally liberated by fluorescent light. It was a paradoxical choice – to use commonplace commercial fixtures and reconfigure them into artworks that both suppressed the artist’s hand, and, through this absence, magnified his presence. When Flavin adopted the fluorescents as the building blocks of his work, they were thought of as utilitarian, modern, and not exactly easy on the eyes. They were, in fact, mostly used to provide cheap, unforgiving illumination in industrial, or at least commercial, environments. To use such a thing and successfully turn it into art was a radical gesture.[1] But, what a gesture it was! Dan Flavin continued to charm the world for the next 30 or more years, inspiring countless other artists who pursued his ideas – though rare ones ever approached him in terms of quality.  Daniel Nicholas Flavin Jr. was in Jamaica, New York and was raised by Catholic parents. Both Dan and his twin brother, David, went to parochial school and attended church services regularly. The artist began drawing at a young age, and the first person to encourage Flavin’s artistic leanings, showing him how to represent movement in the water with little ""half-moons."" After studying for the priesthood for a brief period of time, Dan, along with his brother, enlisted in the US Army – US Air Force more specifically. In 1953, he was posted in Korea, where he served as an air weather meteorological technician. While there, he managed to take art classes offered by the University of Maryland adult extension program. Three years later, being reassigned to Roslyn Air Force Base, he returned to New York. Pursuing his interest in art, he frequently visited New York galleries and took art classes at the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts, as well as the New School for Social Research. The following year, he matriculated at Columbia University with the intention of becoming an art historian to support his work as an artist. Abandoning this route after three semesters, he took various odd jobs, including working in the mailroom of the Guggenheim and as a guard at The Museum of Modern Art. While he was working at MoMA met his first wife, Sonja Severdija. They got married in 1961 and worked together on the construction of the Icon pieces. In 1962, Dan went through a personal tragedy when his brother died. In 1992, Flavin re-married to the artist Tracy Harris. Four years later, Dan Flavin died of complications from diabetes.   It is important to mention the artistic environment in which Dan Flavin made his first works. The years 1955–1965 saw artists wreaking havoc with the parameters of painting. At this time, Flavin was creating paintings, assemblages, and collages, showing his interest in Abstract Expressionism. In the summer of 1961, while working as a guard at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, he started to make sketches for sculptures that incorporated electric lights. Later that year, he translated his sketches into assemblages he called “icons,” which juxtaposed lights onto monochromatic canvases. By using such an everyday material (neon tubing) and arranging it in simple compositions (in rows, or as diagonals, grids, right angles, arcs), Flavin attained a powerful combination of ordinariness and grandeur, and a purity on a par with the modernist artists to whom he dedicated works - Brancusi, Mondrian, Tatlin.[2] By 1963, he removed the canvas altogether and began to work with his signature fluorescent tubes; and by 1968, he had developed his sculptures into room-size environments of light. In the 1970s and 80s, Flavin began to create more complex figurations of fluorescent tubes, notably his “barred corridors” and corner installations. His work increasingly concentrated on the relationship between his sculptures and the spaces they inhabited. In the 1990s, the scale of his light installations became more and more grandiose. A master colorist, Flavin’s works often evoke a cheerful response from visitors – though he does have darker pieces. The monument 4 for those who have been killed in ambush (to P.K. who reminded me about death) (1966) was created in response to the Vietnam War and is made from blood-colored tubes that jut off the wall aggressively — invading the viewer's space.   When discussing Dan Flavin and artists somehow related to him, there are at least two major criteria by which we categorize them. One is Light, other Minimalism. Speaking of the first, there are some people associated with the Light and Space movement, who successfully explored the possibilities of Neon. To name a few: Robert Irwin – an innovator in the Light and Space movement, began his career as a painter and turned to installation as a means of disposing with medium and object altogether. His use of light was painterly, supple and sophisticated; Keith Sonnier - another of the iconic neon artists of the 20th century. He differs from many of his minimalist and post-minimalist contemporaries in the vague figuration of many his works in fluorescent light, which often reference natural forms; Bruce Nauman – an artist less focused on neon as an expressive medium than as a reference to American consumer culture and a vehicle for his bold statements, questioning the role and function of art in society. Though he produced a huge number of neon works, including many that were quite sexually explicit, his best-known work in the medium might be his spiraling 1967 statement, The True Artist Helps the World by Revealing Mystic Truths; Tracey Emin – her confessional works transpose her lovesick confessions into neon, written in her own handwriting. During February 2013, several of her neon phrases, like “You touch my soul” and “I promise to love you” lit up Times Square’s billboards every night at midnight. On the other side, speaking of Minimalism, one name stands out – Donald Judd. Even though he objected the term Minimalism due to its generality, he was remembered as one of the most important minimalists in the history of art. Without making grand philosophical statements, he was approached his work with the intention of creating pieces that assumed a direct material and physical presence.  When someone is as creative, prolific, and groundbreaking as Dan Flavin, is can be quite a challenge to point out to several of his works and mark them as the most influential ones. His breakthrough with fluorescent light was the diagonal of May 25, 1963 (to Constantin Brancusi) – in this seminal work, Flavin first used fluorescent light alone. He eliminated the square box of the icons, and instead positioned a single, unadorned yellow fluorescent light at a 45-degree angle against a gallery wall. By declaring that a fluorescent light tube can stand on its own as a work of art, Dan Flavin boldly challenged the history of art (particularly the discipline’s theoretical separation of art and everyday life), similarly to Marcel Duchamp, whose readymades of the early 20th century consisted of ordinary, utilitarian objects. The “Monument” 1 for V. Tatlin (1964) is a distant rendition of Tatlin’s Monument to the Third International. It is one of 39 so-called monuments to the Russian Constructivist artist, Vladimir Tatlin, who Flavin held in extremely high regard. Meant to be an office building built according to the ideals of Constructivism, Tatlin's Third International was never constructed, although the plans for the monument remain a symbol of the movement. Flavin's Monuments, made up of light bulbs that either burn out or are turned off, have an element of impermanence that memorializes the ghost of Tatlin's unrealized project. The green crossing greens (to Piet Mondrian who lacked green) (1966) is one of Flavin's so-called ""barriers"" – it blocks off the gallery space with two intersecting, fence-like constructions. Dictated by the dimensions of the gallery space in which it is installed, this piece displays traits associated with Conceptual art and can also be considered one of the first pieces of installation art. The crisscrossing framework of Greens crossing greens approximates Mondrian's paintings, which in turn evoke stained glass windows, one of the oldest forms of lighting design. The intense light and imposing physical presence of the installation almost aggressively push against the viewer.   Dan Flavin is, without a doubt, one of the most important and innovative artists of the late twentieth century. The simplicity and systematic character of his extraordinary work, along with his relentless exploration and ingenious discovery of an art of light, established him as a progenitor and chief exponent of Minimalism. Uniquely situated outside the mediums of painting and sculpture, the majority of Flavin’s work after 1963 consists of art made from light.[3] However, by subjugating his material to expiration (neon tubes will eventually burn out) and even choosing the light as his medium (as opposed to the otherwise industrial character of standard Minimalist materials like steel, aluminum, concrete, plastic, glass, and stone), he managed to position himself not just beyond Minimalism, but to reach that unique place that exists outside of the realm of artistic movements in general. In a way, “Flavin’s legacy has to do with the temporal nature of his work. It has an ephemeral quality. It is (as he implied, when he used the word “exposition” instead of “exhibition”) a proposal. It is not so resolute or absolute as marble sculpture or oil painting. A single structure can have different colors, the quality of the light is elusive and changes over time, and the materials are replaceable. On the other hand, he made permanent site-specific work. His oeuvre was open and contradictory in many ways. So I guess the legacy is and will be multifaceted.”[4] He is represented by David Zwirner.  References:  ",2004
Dario Escobar,"Darío Escobar is a well-known Guatemalan conceptual artist born in 1971 in Guatemala City. His work is characterized by the investigation of formal and conceptual aspects of objects and their function in visual arts. He famously uses common and mass-produced materials in conjunction with traditional Guatemalan artisanal techniques and mythological references. Escobar graduated from Rafael Landívar University and studied visual arts at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas “Rafael Rodríguez Padilla” in Guatemala City. His work often combines the present and the past in interesting confrontations. Escobar looks for ways to show how the artistic experience of Guatemala’s history and its religious symbols are related to or overlap with the visual culture of today. Skateboards, ping-pong rackets, and baseball bats are covered with silver to look like religious reliquaries. Rubber bicycle tires snake across long spaces referencing a pre-Hispanic mythological creature. Soccer balls are a frequent material in his body of work – a familiar object altered. These conglomerations, repurposed and reconfigured, make people look at mass produced objects anew. Escobar has been included in many solo and group shows worldwide, including Guatemala City, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Sydney, Paris, Toronto and Caracas. He participated at various Biennales such as the 10 th Havana Biennale, and the 53 rd Venice Biennale in 2009, where the artist represented Latin America. His work also features in numerous collections such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles (MOCA), the Daros Collection in Zurich, Switzerland, the Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundacion and the Colección JUMEX in Mexico, the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, and the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, North Carolina, among others. Escobar lives and works in Guatemala City.    ",2005
Lori Nix,"Lori Nix is an American photographer whose visions of the apocalypse resulted in amazingly detailed photographs of chaotic or abandoned worlds and strange, mutant flora and fauna. The artist spends time in her Brooklyn studio meticulously building dioramas that mimic tiny worlds on the verge of destruction, made of paper, cardboard and foam and she paints them over in an unbelievably realistic way. The photographs of the final product are both humorous and eerie, but above all masterpieces when it comes to their painstakingly thought-out and controlled beauty that won many awards and brought Nix international appraisal.   Lori Nix was born in Kansas in 1969 and she graduated from Truman State University. She studied ceramics and photography and continued to pursue photography at the graduate level at Ohio University. While she was still working on her BFA, Nix started taking photos for a college newspaper as a photojournalist but she quickly discovered that she didn't have the talent of being at the right place to document news. Nix also claims that she’s not gifted enough for portraiture and capturing the models, so she changed her mind and decided to become a photo editor instead of a photojournalist. When it comes to her another field of interest, ceramics, it involves building the world from scratch and this is something Nix is extremely capable of. Her talent to construct something utterly new outweighs her ability to use already existing objects. Since her earliest days, the artist’s main strength was to construct her own little worlds. Nix is certain that her growing up in Kansas was one of the key factors for her artistic development and visions. The climate in Kansas is quite unpredictable and extreme, which was one of the main sources of excitement among the children growing up there. Also, another important influence when it comes to Nix’s childhood were the dystopian movies popular at that time, such as Towering Inferno or Planet of the Apes. Nix was fascinated by these movies and she instills the elements of dark humor and combines them with the sense of disaster present in all of her works.   Nix likes to call herself a fake landscape photographer since her work is strongly influenced by extremely tough weather conditions. However, unlike typical landscape photographers, she doesn’t rely on digital manipulation. Nix is using exclusively miniatures and models in order to create diverse scenery and landscapes featuring natural disasters. Her dioramas can be anything from 20 inches to 6 feet large and it usually takes a few months to build them. After they are finished, it takes additional 2 weeks to photograph them using a large format camera. Nix is not working alone - her partner is a glass artist and she is helping Nix construct highly detailed scenes from scratch. The artist is producing around 3 final photographs for every artwork and she is a highly prolific creator who is working simultaneously on many different projects. She also claims to be influenced by 18th-century landscape painters when it comes to the atmosphere of her photographs, which is without doubt sublime and surreal. In addition to growing up in Kansas, Nix's moving to New York in 1999 had a profound effect on her work. Instead of barren fields of Kansas, Nix is now surrounded by the urban  architecture of skyscrapers and bridges that inevitably found their place in her visions. Instead of barren fields of Kansas, Nix is now surrounded by the urban architecture of skyscrapers and bridges that inevitably found their place in her visions. Her recent work has a dystopian feel similar to the scenes from Blade Runner or Alien combined with her personal fantasy of what New York City and Brooklyn may look like in some grim future. Nix is uncertain about the actual cause of New York's decay, as it may be disasters, virus, global warming, hurricane, basically anything. However, she claims that envisioning something deadly and catastrophic is both chilling and inspiring. Also, it is interesting to mention that architectural details of buildings become more pronounced in a quiet and desolate world without people, since these details cease to be functional and their value relies only on their aesthetical qualities. When it comes to her audience, Nix's goal is to inspire her viewers to explore their own visions, dreams and nightmares of the apocalyptic issues when faced with her photographs. She is emphasizing the idea of photography as a highly subjective medium with the main purpose of introducing an innovative outlook to already known and established ideas.   Nix has been building her miniature models and photographing them since the 1990s. She has produced the following 5 series so far – City, Unnatural History, Lost, Accidentally Kansas and Some Other Place. In Accidentally Kansas, she used a shallow depth of field for her objects and created scenes which are resembling natural disasters and human tragedies. She played with a lot of objects such as wooden boards, tires, cans and boxes, which are often seen in the areas struck by floods. Series Lost and Some Other Place are featuring various rural and urban abandoned areas while Unnatural History is a completely different series. It is an entirely black and white collection of mutant flora and fauna belonging to a dystopian futuristic world. Her most recent series, City, presents an awkward world of the imaginary natural history museum and it doesn’t rely neither on science nor on history. Lori Nix has received many awards for her work. In 2004, she was given an Individual Artist Grant from New York Foundation and in 2001 she won a residency Light Work, which is a worldwide recognized photography organization in New York. In 1999, she also won an Individual Artist Grant of Ohio Council and participated in Artist in the Marketplace program at The Bronx Museum. Her most prestigious achievement happened in 2014 when she was selected as the Guggenheim Fellow for photography. Nix's work has been shown all over the US and currently it is in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, The International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, Rochester, New York, and The Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC.   Even though Nix’s work is revolving around the dark topic of the apocalyptic, dystopian worlds her approach is still playful and humorous, bringing some light and freshness into the topic which has been used many times over the last 40 years, both in the movies and books. The artist’s humor and lightheartedness are emphasized by the use of disposable materials such as cardboard, paper towels and clay, making the fabricated quality of the miniatures very evident. Nix is a true daydreamer and visionary whose success lies in her great skill to merge parts of her exterior and interior worlds into the fantastic yet grim landscapes which are mentally entertaining and aesthetically impressive. Lori Nix lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. ",2006
Adam Fuss,"British-born photographer Adam Fuss is known for his enigmatic photographs, which he creates using photogram techniques. Fuss was born in England and—following the death of his father from a stroke in 1968—moved with his mother to Australia. Fuss later relocated to Alaska as a young adult, working as a photographic apprentice at an advertising agency for two years before moving to New York. He worked several different jobs in the city while experimenting with a pinhole camera, and exhibited these images in galleries in 1985. He then began working with photograms, placing objects on top of photosensitive material and circumventing use of the camera with a technique made famous by Surrealist artists. Fuss received great critical attention for these works, which were acquired for major museum collections. He features evocative imagery in his works—ranging from flowers and natural motifs to images of babies, children’s clothing, abstracted spirals, and drops of water—and his photographs are often suffused with light and an ethereal character. His work has been included in exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the FotoMuseum in Winterthur, Switzerland, and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia. In 2000, Fuss was awarded the 16th Annual Award for Art from the International Center of Photography. He currently lives and works in New York.   ",2007
Jan Kalab,"Jan Kaláb aka Cakes aka Point is a Czech graffiti artist, belonging to the oldest active generation of graffiti writers in the Czech Republic. Jan Kaláb was born 1978 in Czechoslovakia, at a time when the Iron Curtain still existed. In the 80s, when Jan Kaláb was growing up, Eastern World wasn’t familiar with the culture of graffiti. Only a decade later, as Czech Republic separated from Slovakia and the country began opening to different influences, many of western culture became accepted and recognized. During this period, young Jan became infatuated with this new craft, only now to be acknowledged as one of the pioneers of the local scene. With the fall of the Iron Curtain, Jan Kaláb was able to fall into the world of graffiti and street art.   In Prague in the early 90’s, there were a couple of pieces and mostly done by foreigners. As the country was opening itself to western influences, he became one of the pioneers of the local scene, and founded an iconic crew, the DSK. Sleepless nights around train yards, light tubes at police stations and above all hard work on his style: he went through all the classical steps of a writer’s career. Next step was New York, where he made a big impression by painting whole cars in 2000, alongside with Key and Rome. Never one to standstill, his work has continually evolved from working on street art in Europe under the name Cakes, through to the challenging breakthrough of 3-D Graffiti. Using the name Point, he sculpted big abstract letters that were then placed on streets and walls, a departure from traditional graffiti and street art but in keeping with the original spirit of the scene.  Those sculptures lead him to abstraction, a path he’s been exploring through canvas from 2007, using acrylic painting and brushes. In the meantime, this admirer of Kupka graduated from the Academy of fine Arts of Prague – becoming the first Czech writer to do so. In 2007 Jan Kaláb moved to exploring abstraction on canvas, switching to acrylic paints for his studio work. On canvas, his expansive graffiti style is reduced to a concentrated, minimalist expression inspired by Piet Mondrian. The paintings became more geometric with themes of depth, time, motion and dynamics and he took some of these a step further, when he took them onto the streets of various cities to create a series of photographs. Getting involved and exploring a new form of graffiti which consisted or creating huge abstract sculpture-like letters and putting them on street walls, this led his to abstraction – a path he’s been exploring through canvas from 2007, using acrylic painting and brushes. His style of writing graffiti is taken to another level by adding dynamic, colorful and playful compositions with depth and motion.  Jan Kaláb had his first solo exhibition in 2008 in Prague. Others solos took place in Romania, Argentina, Germania or in the United States. With time, his forms became more and more geometric. He used colorful squares and circles as an obsessive vocabulary for infinite variations around depth, time, and motion. Playing with circles conveyed organic imperfection and swing into his work. Dynamic is also crucial in his recent experiments, when he took pictures of some of his paintings in the streets of New York or other cities. The project became a social one when he realized he needed help from strangers to carry the canvas. This is no surprise, since collective energy is crucial in his creative process. The artist is very invested in collective events. He’s the co-creator of a highly dynamic cultural space in Prague, called Trafačka. More than 160 exhibitions took place there from the opening in 2006 till the closure in 2015. On his own or collectively, the motto is the same: always getting higher, always inventing new forms – a tribute to the soul of graffiti. Jan once said to Widewalls: Graffiti is magic. It is something that soaks you in without knowing what is really going on. Jan moved into studio based work explaining it: “It is natural evolution, from rage to concentration. We are grown up now.” The artist is represented by Galerie Openspace, MAGMA Gallery, Golden Hands Gallery, Fabien Castanier Gallery and Art is just a four letter word. ",2008
Jim Hodges,"In his work, American artist Jim Hodges explores the themes of love, fragility, death, and temporality. He combines found objects, such as silver chains, artificial silk flowers, mirrors, and curtains, in his installations, thus creating a poetic vocabulary. The visual diaries, the artist realized early in his career, are better for exploring and reflecting human experience and mortality than paintings. Today at Hodges' auction, his works go for up to six-figures. The artist's work is part of several private and public collections, including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Jim Hodges (born in 1957 in Spokane, Washington) graduated from Fort Wright College with a BA in Fine Arts and received a Master of Fine Arts from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Soon after, the artist faced an artistic crisis that lasted for several years. During that time, he worked as a part-time art handler and lived in the basement of art collector Elaine Dannheisser. The creative block came about from his inability to connect his concepts with the medium of painting. Once he realized the power of found objects, his career soared. Hodges said: The woods of his hometown profoundly influence the artist, so nature is a theme that often appears in his work. To find his artistic expression, he began creating through destruction. In his work, he often challenges preconceived ideas. In such works as You (1997) and With the Wind (1997), the artist incorporated traditionally feminine materials, such as embroidery, into his work, thus expanding their possibilities. In 1992 he confronted the preconceived notion that bodily fluids are disgusting by using his own saliva in his work, creating a ""sensuous act."" In response to the terrorist attack on the two towers in New York, Hodges invited the UN delegates to handwrite a message ""do not be afraid."" The call board consisting of over a hundred messages (except the USA, which refused) was installed at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, in 2005. In 2021 the artist received a commission from MTA Arts & Design for an installation titled I dreamed a world and called it Love, created out of more than 5000 pieces of mirrored glass. It was installed at Grand Central Station in New York. Jim Hodges, winner of the Association Internationale des Critiques d'art prize (2006), has had numerous solo exhibitions, including Location Proximity (2022) at Gladstone 64 in New York, Jim Hodges (2021) at Gladstone Gallery in Brussels, and LOVE POWER (2020) at Massimo de Carlo in Hong Kong. In 2013 a major retrospective of his oeuvre opened at the Walker Art Center and Dallas Museum of Art. Jim Hodges lives and works in New York. ",2009
Matt Bilfield,"Matt Bilfield is an American contemporary artist known for his bold pop art portraits in which he combines the cartoon style of Lichtenstein with the pointillism of Chuck Close. His works are made of a grid from thousands painted dowels, bringing them into focus while viewer is watching at them.  Born in New Jersey, raised in Southern California, Bilfield taught himself graphic design and built a career around it. In the framework of the television graphics that artist has created, he noticed it was always the image that constantly changes as the viewer watches. In conceptualizing a series of artwork, he wanted to create pieces where the vantage point dictates the image and abundance of color, in turn activating the viewer. Where the television screen has the screen framework as its boundary, he wanted to extend that boundary to the dimensions of the room itself. His idea was that everyone viewing the art gets his or her own unique perspective.  Bilfield’s most famous piece, Peggy, was constructed over the course of five months. Seven feet wide and three feet tall, ""Peggy"" is comprised of 2788 hand cut, sanded, and painted dowels that were then assembled together to recreate Roy Litchenstein’s piece “M-maybe”. The result is a cross between a graphic art image, sculpture, and installation which offers the viewer a different experience from every angle.  Bilfield has been an animator for Fox for almost ten years now, and having always worked on a digital art format, his physical art is made up of tangible pixels that a viewer can not only see in person, but also walk around and experience on an emotional and physical level. In one of his latest series, ""It’s in the Eyes"", by obscuring the eyes with various imagery or by obstructing the eyes altogether, he wanted to encourage viewers to connect their own individual experiences to the pieces, in turn creating an entirely unique experience for everyone beyond the computer or television screen. To achieve this, artist increased the density of the dowels and designed a frameless backing that allows the color and the images to take center stage. Matt Bilfield lives and works in Los Angeles, California, USA.",2010
Dimitris Taxis,"Dimitris Trimintzios, known as Taxis or Dimitris Taxis, was born in Szczecin, Poland, in May 1983, to a Polish art/cultural historian mother and a Greek etcher/painter father. When he was at the age of three his family moved to Athens, Greece. Taxis studied painting in the School of Fine Arts of Athens under the guidance of professors Rena Papaspirou and Marios Spiliopoulos and graduated with first-class degree in 2008.  Growing up in an artistic family, Taxis was introduced to the world of art from a very young age, which developed Dimitris’ an urge to find a way to express himself. At the age of 14, during a family vacation in Poland, he became familiar with the art of graffiti. Since 1998 Taxis has been involved with graffiti and has participated in international graffiti festivals such as Meeting of Styles and Write for Gold.  Taxis entered into comics in 2003. His short stories have been published in the BABEL Comic Magazine (currently called MOV) since 2005. He has participated in international comic festivals in Greece, Poland, and Italy, to name a few, and has been awarded several times in comic competitions. He has collaborated with newspapers, magazines and books as an illustrator, as well. In 2004 Taxis worked as a cinematographer for the movie “A Pink Safety Pin” by Nikos Pomonis, which won a citation at the Digital Wave Competition, at the 47th Thessaloniki International Film Festival in 2006. In 2005 he was one of the set designers for the movie “Pink” by Alexander Voulgaris. At the same time he started to paste handmade posters at the streets of Athens and later on abroad, including Berlin and Barcelona. His characteristic comic style is what established him in the street world.  Dimitris’s point of reference is the human himself. He is intrigued by the everyday inner struggle that society forces each individual to go through. In his art he aims to capture the feelings of desolation and hardship, feelings that have always tormented humanity. He believes that his work states obvious matters that many people tend to forget or ignore which in fact is something that should be strongly reexamined. His goal is to provoke the viewer into a conversation with himself in which he can expand or delve deeper according to his own perception. His artwork is more like a game between the picture and the viewer. There is no specific plan as well as technique since they evolve every day. Thoughts, sketches and style change day after day according to the impulses he gets. Taxis objects to stability so he always tests out every thought that he finds absorbing. Artist uses a wide variety of materials and techniques both to challenge himself and to discover new potentials. Currently Taxis paints walls, makes murals but focuses on his work on canvas, paper and wood at his studio in Athens, where he lives.   ",2011
Anton Corbijn,"One of the world's most recognized photographers and a celebrated director, Anton Corbijn is a Dutch artist who has shot some of the most famous musicians of the past four decades. Best known for his distinctive collection of black and white images, the list of his subjects includes music icons that range from the Rolling Stones and the Sex Pistols to Björk and Luciano Pavarotti. In addition to his impressive body of photographic work, Corbijn is also famed for his collaboration with bands such as Nirvana, Joy Division and Coldplay, as well as Depeche Mode that he is known as bands' invisible member. His creative relationship with U2 band is one of his most prolific that has resulted in a rather brilliant album covers for The Unforgettable Fire, Rattle and Hum, The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby as well as several music videos, including One.   The son of a Protestant minister, Corbijn was very shy as a boy. In the summer of 1972, his father Anton Corbijn van Willenswaard took up the position in the small Dutch town of Groningen moving his wife and four children with him. Having no friends in this new area, 16-years-old Anton heard about a concert of Herman Brood and wanted to attend, but didn’t want to go alone and draw attention to himself. He asked his father if he could borrow his the camera so he could get to the stage without feeling like people would be staring. After getting the photographs developed, Corbijn sent them off to a magazine, and, to his surprise, they published them. That was the moment that changed his life as he became interested in creating photos for the world of music. Within a few years, Corbijn realized that the musicians he enjoyed the most had lived in the United Kingdom, so he decided to move to London in 1979. Two weeks after his arrival in England, he found himself at a concert of his favorite band, Joy Division and, at the end of it, was able to meet the band. Additionally, they invited him to shoot some photographs of them.   From the late 1970s, New Musical Express (NME), a British music journalism magazine, featured his oeuvre on a regular basis and would often have a photograph by him on the front page. Traveling for them to different cities throughout England, Corbijn has started to shoot in black and white, mostly inspired by the bleak and desolate environment and poverty-stricken areas, as well as by the melancholy music and musicians surrounding him. Giving a stark and lonely look to his images, Corbijn’s subjects appear to be calm and far removed from everyday life. His photographs show raw emotion. The artist’s style of producing black and white photos using grainy films became an important part of the visual culture and has been imitated and copied greatly. In the early years of London-based The Face, Corbijn was a regular contributor. During this period, Corbijn also began to take photographs for famed magazines such as Vogue and Rolling Stone.   Anton Corbijn met Depeche Mode in the early ‘80s when NME asked him to do some shots of the band. After that, he was asked to shoot them again, but Anton refused at first because he thought they were wimps. Since then, Corbijn has changed Depeche Mode’s image and gave them a different look. The incredible body of work produced with Depeche Mode includes more than a dozen music videos, from the spaghetti-western inspired Personal Jesus to the tongue-in-cheek homage to 70s cinema, It’s No Good, in which Corbijn even cast himself in a cameo. In 2014, the artist directed Depeche Mode Live in Berlin, a concert film featuring a 21-song set, plus behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, extras and a two-song acoustic session. It was filmed on location at the O2 World Berlin on November 25th and 27th, 2013 during the band’s Delta Machine Tour.    Many of Corbijn’s photographs have become iconic images of modern pop culture. Amongst Depeche Mode, he has photographed musicians, scientist, models, actors and actresses, including names like Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Miles Davis, Björk, Elvis Costello, Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Cameron Diaz, Naomi Campbell, Stephen Hawking, Morrissey, Simple Minds, The Cramps, Roxette and Herbert Grönemeyer, and thousands of others as well. In 2003, he made a portrait series of Nelson Mandela in Cape Town. Several years later, one of these portraits formed the base of a delightful artistic  collaboration between Corbijn and Dutch visual artist Berend Strik who re-worked the portrait by using his remarkable stitching technique. It resulted in a double-sided artwork - Mandela Landscape - the backside showing a labyrinth of wires and stitches. Both the original piece and a limited edition of 80 prints were sold to fund the international edition of ZAM Magazine, an independent multi-media platform celebrating African creativity and new thinking. Album covers featuring photos by Corbijn include those for Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, Nick Cave, Bryan Adams, Metallica, Bon Jovi, The Killers, Marianne Faithfull, Simple Minds, R.E.M., The Bee Gees, Saybia and Moke, to name a few.   Besides his photographic oeuvre, Anton Corbijn also designed stages, directed music videos and directs feature films these days. He directed more than 75 video clips for Palais Schaumburg, David Sylvian, Golden Earring, Depeche Mode, Coldplay, Nirvana and U2, among others. His first video in color was made for U2 in 1984 for their single Pride (In the Name of Love). In 2005, Palm Pictures released a DVD collection of his video output as part of the Directors Label series. In 1994, the artist directed Some Yoyo Stuff, a short film about Don van Vliet, alias Captain Beefheart for the BBC.   Corbijn’s made his directorial debut with Control, a film about the life and death of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis. It won several awards at the Cannes Film Festival, including the Director’s Fortnight. Control went on to win five British Independent Film Awards including Best Film and Best Director. In 2010, Anton Corbijn directed the film titled The American, starring George Clooney. Corbijn’s third film A Most Wanted Man with Rachel McAdams and Robin Wright, was released in 2014. His latest movie entitled Life is about a brief, but transformative period in the life of Dennis Stock, a photographer for Life assigned to shoot pictures of James Dean. The movie stars Robert Pattinson as Stock and Dane DeHaan as Dean. The film had its premiere at 65th Berlin International Film Festival, at Berlinale Special Gala at the Zoo Palast on February 9, 2015.  In 2012, Anton Corbijn was the subject of Inside Out, the documentary portrait made by a Dutch director and producer Klaartje Quirijns who followed the artist as he traveled the globe doing photography and making films. The 80 mins picture portrait investigates the artist persona “uncovering his motivation and inherent conflict as an artist, between audience’s admiration and personal loneliness.” The result of almost four years of filming, Inside Out includes interviews with Bono, George Clooney and Corbijn’s family, and also follows the man himself to his home, his studio and places of work. Featuring appearances from U2, Metallica, Lou Reed, Arcade Fire, Depeche Mode it also holds a soundtrack including Joy Division, Nirvana, Depeche Mode, U2 and original music by Gavin Friday.  Corbijn fused his love of art, music and photography into a career that spans iconic album covers, genre-defining music videos, as well as amazing films and portraiture. He has photographed nearly every major world musician creating some of the most recognizable black and white portraits. He has always strived to create a body of work that is timeless, ageless, and both documentary and narrative. Almost four decades in the industry, he continues to make alluring photographs that emanate stillness. His oeuvre has been exhibited in many one-man and collective shows throughout the world. In 2015, the Gemeentemuseum den Haag and the Hague Museum of Photography organized a pair of retrospective shows to mark the artist’s sixtieth birthday. The exhibition featured highlights from all Corbijn’s series and work that ranges across his iconic imagery, personal projects and collaborations. The photographer has also published many books, including Famouz (1989), Strangers (1990), Allegro (1991), 33 Still Lives (1999), Werk (2000), Everybody Hurts (2003), U2 and I (2005), among others.

Abelardo Morell,"Connecting the modern approaches with the earliest beginnings and first techniques that announced photography, Abelardo Morell became recognizable for his employment of the variety of unusual methods, such as tintypes, glass negatives, wet plate collodion, cyanotypes, cliché-verres and, most famously, the camera obscura. Deftly balancing the philosophical thoughts, scientific severity, and modern traditions, his images evoke the Impressionist paintings where beautiful landscapes are juxtaposed with unexpected and innovative elements conjoined into the new realities. Spending a lot of time with his son, the artist started to show an interest in the exploration of the world from a child’s perspective, approaching common objects in a different way by distorting angles, exaggerating the close-ups, and changing perspectives, challenging the viewer’s perception of the things he sees. His fascination with reality and illusion is the most obvious in his Camera Obscura series, which remained his most ambitious projects and the landmark of his career.  Abelardo Morell was born in 1948 in Havana, the capital of Cuba. During his early childhood, he has already discovered his love towards photography, spending many hours looking at pages of photographs in National Geographic magazines he has found in his uncle’s house. In 1962, his family immigrated to the United States, which later greatly influenced his approach to art and creativity. Although scared and insecure because of the new environment where he faced conflicts of cultures and languages, Morell has also felt some kind of encouragement and wish for adventure. Not knowing the language turned out to be an advantage, enabling him to explore alternative ways of making impressions of his new country, employing his senses. Pursuing his artistic strivings, the artist earned his undergraduate degree at the Bowdoin College in Maine and an MFA in Photography at the Yale University School of Art in 1981. The photography classes he attended underlined the passion he felt for this medium, confirming that it had the power to make him express his deepest feelings of alienation and absurdity bottled up through the years. During his developing years, he was mostly influenced by greatest names of the street photography, such as Henry Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank. After the great success with Light Bulb, that confirmed that any room and space could be used as a camera, in 1991, Morell started to work on his landmark series, Camera Obscura. In that time, he held the teaching position at the Massachusetts College of Art where actually began his lifelong artistic journey. At one of his classes, he was demonstrating to his students the basic principles of photography – the illumination passing through an aperture projecting the image. In order to produce a camera obscura image, Morell had to cover all windows with black plastic to get a total darkness. After cutting a small hole in the material, the inverted projection of an outside world – street, cars, people and buildings – appeared on the wall. In the beginning, Morell used a large-format 4×5 view camera with black-and-white films, spending a whole summer trying to figure out the correct exposures in order to capture camera obscura effect with the best results. Extremely long, those exposures took from five to ten hours.  For his more recent body of work, Morell began to experiment with color film, using Mamiya 645 camera equipped with a digital back. As the result, new images appear sharper and more detailed, with increased brightness. The employment of prism enabled him to render the incoming projections right-side up and with help of digital technology the artist managed to shorten the exposures considerably, making it possible to catch more passing temporary light[1]. From the first disorienting impression when the viewer seeks for something familiar, minds need to take a moment to comprehend that image actually presents the exterior world projected upside down on an interior setting. Sometimes contributing to initial disorientation, Morell includes elements such as painting on the wall with an inverted image, or opened door as a passage to whole new reality. The principle behind his distinctive technique has been known for centuries. There are records where Aristotle mentions this phenomenon and the first detailed explanation was given by Muslim scholar Abu Ali Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haitham in the 10th century. In the past, camera obscura was used for different purposes, to depict the world outside the dark chamber, while Morell has a totally different approach and goal, combining the exterior with the interior world, changing the way of perception of both[2]. Mechanically simple, these images are technically sophisticated and artistically subtle and surprising, characterized by playful sensibility hidden behind its initial confusion. Once he tried to include himself in the photograph, but considering the fact that each exposure for the Camera Obscura series requires approximately eight hours, he became exhausted and started hallucinating and the effect on the image was the only almost visible trace of the human figure which thwarted his idea of including people in his work.   Skillfully balancing philosophical approach with a scientific precision, Morell continues to experiment and play, creating various collages, Photograms, cliché-verres, improving camera obscura technique and developing new methods such as adopting a tent so that he can take the images outdoors. Merging the drawing, painting, and photography, one of the most unusual techniques he uses, cliché-verres, literally means glass picture and originates from the 19th-century practice of making handmade negative. The original process of creation includes a piece of flat glass smoked with a lit candle, whose surface is then scratched with a sharp pointed instrument. After making drawings on a glass, the surface is placed over a sheet of photographic paper and exposed to luminescence, giving the interesting lines in black on a white background. In a similar manner he creates Photograms, the photographic images made without the camera, but with the use of light-sensitive material, commonly photographic paper on which is placed some object later exposed to illumination. The resulting negative shadow image represents the various tones, depending upon the transparency of the used object. Morell uses this technique to produce handmade negatives with 8x10 film, creating captivating pieces after exposing negatives to light. Besides photography, Morell is also active in the fields of illustration, publications, and book publishing, and since 1995 when he issued his A Camera in a Room by Smithsonian Press, the artist created several successful publications and monographs, such as Camera Obscura printed in 2004 by Bulfinch, and Abelardo Morell, published by Phaidon in 2005, and a limited edition book by The Museum of Modern Art – MoMA in New York about his cliché-verre photo series, with a text written by Oliver Sacks. His most interesting and at the same time most famous book is a photographic illustration of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland published in 1998 by Dutton Children’s Books. For this project, the artist had in mind that books themselves should form the architecture and landscapes of the places described in Lewis Carroll’s famous novel. Morell made photographs that visually suit the tale of Alice well – his illustrations merge drawings and the book itself, making the feeling of how the traveling to Wonderland could really seem. Having an interesting life and career, Abelardo Morelli was a subject of the documentary Shadow of the House, filmed in 2007, which explored his artistic experiences and life’s turmoil related to the sense of identity, familial commitment, and cultural politics between Cuba and the United States. Following the artist and his family for over seven years, film director Allie Humenuk worked completely alone on this achievement. One of the most interesting details during the filming was the occasion when Morell decided to return to Cuba, for the first time since his escape in 1962 and more than forty years of living in exile, which provoked a stream of disagreement and fear in his family. Film’s title refers to several meanings, pointing out the term of shadows as an inseparable part of his person – it could be said that he has spent his life living in a shadow of Cuba and eventually it became the key ingredient for his artistic process and technique. Elegantly crafted and complex, this in-depth documentary also represents a rare look into Morell’s past and his unique artistic vision. The beauty of the Shadow of the House lies in the way it gives shadows their due, but at the same time not losing sight of the predominance of light in both Abelardo Morell’s art and life.   During his long career, Morell’s work has been featured in numerous group and solo exhibitions, at the renowned art venues and institutions such as Museum of Modern Art – MoMA in New York, The Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York, The Chicago Art Institute, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Houston Museum of Art, The Boston Museum of Fine Art, and The Victoria and Albert Museum in London. A major retrospective dedicated to his achievements titled The Universe Next Door was firstly on display at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2013 and later touring to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles and The High Museum in Atlanta. The exhibition included over 100 pieces made from 1986 until 2013, embracing a wide range of works, from his earliest series to Photograms, cliché-verres, to the new, digitally manipulated color photographs. His opulent oeuvre was recognized and confirmed by a number of honors and grants, including a Cintas grant in 1992, a Guggenheim fellowship in 1994, a Rappaport Prize in 2006 and an Alturas Foundation grant in 2009, and most recently the International Center of Photography Infinity award in Art, in 2011[3]. In 1997, Morell received an honorary Doctor’s degree in Fine Arts from Bowdoin College.  References:  ",2013
Quintessenz,"An artist duo that dwells on materials, space and the transitions in between, Quintessenz comes from Germany and consists of Thomas Granseuer and Tomislav Topic. They have started off as a team in 2008 and now have their studios in Berlin and Hannover. Both of them have their roots in the graffiti scene and have worked together on various projects during their time as students at the University of Applied Arts and sciences in Hildesheim. The accent is on film, installation, mural art, and painting. Always thinking “processual”, handmade is a strong priority for them. In their work, they combine the analog and the digital, and that’s apparent in their workshop and in the many objects and installations they have built in the past. The duo enjoys going on tours, seeing where the road will take them next – this freedom to experiment is what gives them the inspiration to explore new paths and ideas, and to continue producing great work.  They met at the University of Applied Arts in Hildesheim in 2006, with both of them were already active as graffiti artists. “The studying shaped and morphed the graffiti attitude in something different. When we started in young age with graffiti we didn’t expect anything from that, we were just going crazy with our crews and had a good time. It shaped our understanding of colors and shapes.” Not just that – there were also the planning of big murals as a team, doing bombings, panels, and wholecars as fast as they could. These experiences have trained them in many ways and have brought them up to the place where they are today. Their biggest influence is the combination of their graffiti roots and the art and design education they received at the University. There were so many different influences – the Professors at the school, the graffiti scene itself and other artists such as Olafur Eliasson, Katharina Grosse, Frank Stella, Dan Flavin or Mark Rothko. It was always important for the duo to work interdisciplinary and look between different genres. They experiment a lot with different materials and this inspires and influences them a lot. Speaking of inspiration, the very fact they are a duo means they always inspire each other somehow – this might be the greatest inspiration since you always have someone to exchange and to reflect with. And, of course, Berlin and its people are a great and subconscious source of inspiration.    In terms of techniques, mediums, materials they use, Quintessenz state that their artworks and their style have to surprise them. There are plenty different techniques they have explored and are still exploring. The style is, of course, very colorful – “this is the main topic for us as abstract artists; it’s all about the colors, the quantity, the contrasts and the shapes in which they appear. We’re building abstract and colorful installations, paint murals and used to do stop motion films. Everything comes together somehow, mainly through the colors and the way we work with them. People from the outside really define us through the colors because every artwork appears in its shape and material differently.” Their creative process includes trying to figure out the big works outside, as they always mean something special. It’s really important for them to see the place before they start to build an installation. With the murals, (if it’s possible) they often try to choose the colors on-site. Also, the composition and the shapes of a mural are based on the architecture and moods surrounding the wall where they paint on. When working in a studio, a significant amount of pieces is a direct result of some sort of experimenting. Sometimes even the mistakes in a certain experiment can introduce new possibilities. “When we have the freedom we’re not planning every single step previously. What happens during a current process of a project brings us many times the influences for the next project.”   “One of the main topics is contrast. The relationship between colors and shapes, between environment and artwork, between analog and digital. The most important thing is that we surprise and don’t repeat ourselves, this way of thinking defiantly goes into our work. The worst thing we can imagine is to do the same work again and again, just with small varieties. We don’t transport any political statements or stories in our work, it’s all about here and now, it’s about current feelings and emotions, it’s about our experiences and it’s about the relationship between the people and us. We’re trying to break the view habits of the viewer and us.” Both Tomislav and Thomas were drawing before graffiti, and after enrolling at the University, every single influence along the way pushed their evolution forward. In 2008, they made their first stop-motion film – it was about colors conquering an abandoned area. Until 2011, they produced 6 stop motion films, and these have really pushed their personal style. One of them was titled “True Colors”, and it was Tomislav’s diploma work. The artists only had four months to work on the film, but the results were amazing. There was so much positive feedback, and many festivals invited them to participate. In 2015, Quintessenz were elected by a New Yorker Photo stock agency as one of ten most creative and unique creative studios in Germany, which was an incredible honor for the duo. Besides art, they currently teach at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hildesheim, where the work with the students really reflects the duo, their work and how they communicate it.    Surprisingly, the most important moment in their careers was not the biggest work or installation. Instead, it was their solo show The part of me. They previously never had their works together – because of the variety of their works and the different ways they work, it can be rather hard to understand the connection between the different works. On that very special day, every single work by both of them came together, and just like that, everything came together for the artists. Suddenly, everything made sense, and every work was connected with other works. This show might not have been their biggest one, but it was certainly the most important one. Speaking of the relationship with the viewers, Quintessenz states that they have never tried to send conscious messages to them. “Obviously we’re not sending any political or provocative messages. It’s more about subconscious things, the way colors and shapes bring a contrast to the outside world. It’s more about the beauty and feeling of materials and the way how they appear.” With so much struggle going on, the artists are just trying to create something the people can understand, something that simply exists.

Greg Simkins,"As we grow older, it seems that most of us lose our childishness - we become more mature and less capable of being spontaneous, unselfconscious and cheerful. All those fascinating creatures who lived only in our imagination disappear and we are forced to get into the world of adults. However, there are still people who didn’t lose much of the childhood fascination for excitement and curiosities. One of them definitely is the American painter, graffiti artist, and illustrator Greg Simkins, also known as Craola. Born in 1975 in Torrance, an affluent city in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County in California, Craola makes artworks that take us into the worlds that we, unfortunately, lose when growing into adulthood, when responsibility takes over, forgetting the miraculous places we created in our imagination.   Greg Simkins began drawing when he was only three years old inspired by various cartoons and books including Watership Down by Richard Adams, The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster, and The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. At the age of 18, Greg started doing graffiti under the name “Craola”. Graffiti taught him perspective, composition, and color theory so he turned to large-scale works while further developing his artistic skills. Simkins received his BA in Studio Art from California State University, Long Beach in 1999. After graduating, Greg worked as an illustrator for different clothing companies and bands, but also worked on video games. Greg Simkins became a full-time artist in 2005. His paintings display wonderful mythical landscapes, full of weird creatures that occupy those long forgotten dark corners of the mind. His instantly recognizable surreal subjects are painted with such skill that their lack of reality is completely natural. Out of his love for the animal world he seeks to bring together unlikely friendships and conflicts including deer with killer whales, puppies with crustacean pals, and birds sharing the air with rodents.    IMSCARED is Greg Simkins own brand of clothing, merchandise and accessories developed in 2009, to further expand Craola’s art into more everyday mediums that can be worn and enjoyed by his diverse fan base. I’m Scared: The Movie! is a stop-motion short film based on Greg Simkins’s work. The story of two brothers, facing the things that go bump in the night, are filmed in collaboration with director Pete Levin, whose credits include IFC’s Comedy Bang Bang and Cartoon Network’s MAD. The film was funded by a substantial Kickstarter project.  Simkins’ artworks can be found in the collections of many celebrities including the film director Nick Cassavetes, Grammy award winning singer-songwriter Everlast, singer Fergie, actor Josh Duhamel, CEO of Nike Mark Parker, Lead Singer of Good Charlotte Joel Madden and numerous others. Craola’s commercial client/collaboration list includes Disney, Pearl Jam, Linkin Park, Juxtapoz, Mattel, Logitech, Converse, Pulse International, Eddie Vedder, Blink 182, Upper Playground, to name a few. Greg Simkins’ art can also be found in a wide variety of industries from clothing to video games and it has come to life in the form of toys.  Simkins’ work has been included in numerous individual and collective shows throughout the United States and beyond. One of his latest solo exhibitions took place at the KP Projects. Titled Where am I, it was Greg’s fourth solo show at the Los Angeles Gallery; his earlier exhibitions at the space devoted to exhibiting contemporary works of art that are challenging, innovative and committed to fostering new directions in American art, include Good Knight (2014), Greg Craola Simkins (2013), and Cloud Theory (2012). In 2011, Simkins had his curatorial debut with INLE at Gallery Nineteen Eighty Eight, a show in which he also participated.   Widely recognized for his highly imaginative and surreal works, Greg Craola Simkins explores pop surrealism through fine art. He has created his own universe called “The Outside”. Much like the other worlds we have had glimpses of such as Narnia, Neverland and Middle Earth, he has created his own place to inhabit, escape to and daydream about. It is full of heroes and villains, and similar creatures beyond imagination who are still waiting to be invented. All those things that excited us as kids, Greg Simkins attempts to get back through working on this world. The artist is represented by KP Projects (formerly known as Merry Karnowsky Gallery).

Mambo,"Flavien Demarigny aka Mambo is a Chile-born Franco-Hungarian painter, travelling designer and graphic artist. Born in 1969 in Santiago, Mambo grew up in Latin America. He moved to the capital of France in the mid-80s, where he started his artistic career as a graphic designer and a street artist. After several years of experience, his work has developed into canvas painting and large size murals.  Influenced by the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Piet Mondrian, Keith Haring and Jean Dubuffet, Mambo has developed the foundation of his unique language described as “illustrated brain, full of visions and emotions”. Mambo’s pieces range from figurative to abstract, with humanity as the main theme of his practice. The most often character in his works is Man, presented as an orange figure who could be everyone’s personification. Showing Man through various attitudes called Les emotifs, Mambo captures the feelings, emotions and behavior, or simply, the essence of humanity. His later works often shows modern society’s icons, familiar visual codes, and pictograms.   In Mambo’s semi-abstract pieces called Brainology, images are connected like memories, through fluid and gracious lineages. The artist draws lines in a one single gesture, following his imagination, and revealing the poetry inside our minds by liberating artistic expression from pre-set frameworks. Fascinated by the development of biology, technology and cognitive sciences, Mambo’s more abstract paintings suggest his vision of scientific innovation ever expanding human knowledge.  From 1986 to 1997, Mambo was member of Force Alphabétique, while in 1998 he became a member of a famous Parisian collective of artists, 9ème concept, characterized by its freedom in creating accessible art on the streets for anyone. Mambo has collaborated in creative projects with Prada, Canal Plus, Samsung Crooks’n’Castles and Vans.  Mambo has participated in numerous solo and group shows worldwide, including the Centre Pompidou, Paris, Speerstra Gallery, Geneva, Magda Danysz Gallery, Paris, Helmet Gallery, Munich, Agnès B. Gallery, Paris, Watanabe Gallery, Osaka, Seven Gallery, Paris, Kinsey Desforges Gallery, Los Angeles, French Art Studio, London, as well as at the Biennale Arts Le Havre, and Sao Paulo’s Biennale, amongst others. His solo show Convergence will be on view from June 13th until July 3rd, 2015, at French Art Studio in London, UK.  Mambo’s work is part of many notable collections, including Centre Pompidou, Duran Ruel, Rose Bialek, Speerstra, Thierry Froger, Agnès B, Kinsey Desforges, and Nao Naussbaum. Mambo currently lives and works in Los Angeles, California.",2016
Etel Adnan,"Etel Adnan was a poetess, novelist, essayist and visual artist born in 1925, in Beirut, Lebanon, to a Muslim Syrian father and a Christian Greek mother. After attending a Catholic convent run by French nuns in Beirut, Etel traveled to Paris where she received a degree in philosophy from the Sorbonne. In January 1955 she moved to the United States to pursue postgraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and at Harvard University. From 1958 to 1972, Adnan taught philosophy at Dominican College of San Rafael, California. She has also lectured at several universities throughout the USA. After returning to Lebanon in 1972, she worked as cultural editor for for two daily newspapers, first for Al Safa, then for L’Orient le Jour. She left the country in 1976.  Though she grew up in a primarily Arabic-speaking society, French became the language in which her early work was first written, while most of her later work has been first written in English. Caught between languages, her interest in visual art developed during the years of the Algerian war of independence, when writing in French had political implications which the artist, out of solidarity with the rebels, refused to accept. She shifted the focus of her creative expression to visual art, and became a painter. Her first artworks date to 1958, at a time when Adnan had already moved to the Sausalito, a San Francisco Bay Area city in Marin County, California. Although primarily a writer, Etel left her paintings untitled because she felt that the words might taint their innocence. Etel Adnan painted in oil paint with the canvas laid on a table, using a palette knife to apply the paint onto the canvas in firm swipes across the picture’s surface, often directly from the tube.   During her stay in Sausalito, Adnan began to focus on the surrounding landscape, inspired by the Mount Tamalpais, the highest peak overlooking San Francisco Bay which was visible from the windows of her home. The mountain became a permanent reference point which she depicted repeatedly in her paintings, capturing its ever changing moods and dynamic at different times of day, throughout the years. Over the years she has expressed her love for this mountain by dedicating books and poems to it, culminating with 1986 book, Journey to Mount Tamalpais, described as a meditation on the links between nature and art.  Alongside painting, since the 1960s, she has painted, drawn and made leporellos, pocket-sized fold-out books. The leporellos combine verbal and visual observation and are splendidly illustrated, filled with landscapes and transcriptions of Adnan’s own writing  as well as of Arab poetry by writers such as Mahmoud Darwish and Yusuf al-Khal. Etel Adnan also made tapestries which translate the vivid colors of her paintings into wool. Many of her tapestries are in public spaces and private collections, including the Contemporary Crafts Museums of New York and Los Angeles.  Etel Adnan retired from a permanent teaching position in the late 1970s and devoted herself to art and writing. A powerful voice in feminist and antiwar movements, Adnan has published many works of poetry and fiction, among which are The Arab Apocalypse, 1989, Of Cities and Women, Letters to Fawwaz, 1993, and Master of the Eclipse, 2009. One of her most notable novels is Sitt Marie Rose, first published in 1977. Set in the civil war in Lebanon, the book deals in dramatic terms with the issue of religious and political integralism and the role of women in Lebanese society. Winner of the France-Pays Arabes prize in 1977, Sitt Marie Rose has been translated into more than 10 languages, becoming a classic of War Literature.   In the late seventies, she wrote texts for two documentaries made by Jocelyne Saab, on the civil war in Lebanon, which were shown on French television as well as in Europe and Japan, and several theatre pieces, including Comme un arbre de Noël, and L’actrice. She worked on a film about Calamity Jane in collaboration with Delphine Seyring, and a musical work with her Love Poems. Many of Adnan’s poems have been set to music, for example by Gavin Bryars Adnan Songbook and by Zad Moultaka Nepsis.   Etel Adnan has participated in numerous solo and group shows worldwide. Her work was recently presented in the solo exhibition Etel Adnan in All Her Dimensions at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha, Qatar, 2014, and was included in the Whitney Biennial, New York, 2014, and Documenta 13, Kassel, Germany, 2013. Etel Adnan’s had her first solo show in China at Galleria Continua Beijing in 2014.  Etel Adnan received many awards for her contribution to culture, including the Arab American Book Awards for Master of the Eclipse in 2010, the California Book Award for Poetry for her collection Sea and Fog in 2013, and RAWI Lifetime Achievement Award from the Radius of Arab-American Writers, among others. In 2014, Adnan received France's highest cultural honour, the Ordre de Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. Etel Adnan has works in many notable private and public collections including the Royal Jordanian Museum, the Tunis Modern Art Museum, the Sursock Museum in Beirut, the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris, the British Museum in London, the World Bank Collection in Washington D.C., the National Museum for Women in the Arts, Washington D.C., among others.  Etel Adnan lived and worked between Paris, France and Sausalito, California.",2017
Nicola Lopez,"Nicola López is an American artist who works in installation, drawing and printmaking. Her installation work incorporates printed elements and various other materials creating industrial environmental landscapes with objects of construction and architectural decay. Born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Nicola received a BA in anthropology and MFA from Columbia University. She also attended Skowhegan School for Painting and Sculpture in Maine as well as the School of Visual Arts in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She teaches at Columbia University in New York City.  Through her work in printmaking, drawing and installation, Nicola López explores our contemporary, primarily urban, landscape. Her focus on describing “place” stems from an interest in urban planning, architecture and anthropology and it has been inspired by time spent working and traveling in countries such as Mexico, Peru and Morocco. López builds her work by layering image upon image, often drawing upon cartography and using printmaking, collage, drawing, and installation to create maps of her own visions of urban cityscapes. Abandoned contemporary environments appear in a state of decay, or perhaps left only partly completed.   In her Monument series made in 2009, Nicola López depicts a landscape that is somewhere between present and future, but mostly defined by its past. The central forms in every image from the Monument  series are pieces of a bigger construction that was once whole but has now mostly fallen down, contributing to the fields of ruins out of which the Monuments rise. Although López’s collapsing built environments suggest this natural process of decay, they are still charged with potency and even grace. “I describe a world that is beautiful and full of destruction that contains moments of order and symmetry and yet hangs on the edge of spinning beyond our control. My images do not propose a clear picture of reality, but ask the question of where we really are and where we might be going.” – Nicola López  López’s site-specific work Un-building Things was commissioned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art  for the Balcony Lounge, New York, in 2013. López created Un-Building Things using linocut and monoprinting techniques on top of mylar forms that were laser-cut from hand-drawn stencils. The elements of the piece were printed and assembled by López, in collaboration with Pace Editions’ printers, over the course of two months, then installed on-site in the Balcony Lounge by the artist. The first commission, Un-building Things is on view until mid 2016.  López's site-specific installation, Landscape X: Under Construction was made in 2011, as part of the Guggenheim’s Intervals series, designed to reflect the spirit of today’s most innovative practices. A sculptural collage environment in the museum’s Frank Lloyd Wright–designed rotunda, Landscape X: Under Construction enclose viewers in an industrial dreamscape, a reference both ethereal and literal to the world outside the museum’s doors. Using various printing and collage methods, López has created a situation where the exterior floods the interior, the grid invades the spiral, and distortion trumps order.  López received an MFA Graduate Award from the Joan Mitchell Foundation and support for her work through a NYFA Fellowship in Drawing/Printmaking/Book Arts, among others. She completed residencies at the Headlands Center for the Arts, Sausalito, California, La Curtiduría in Oaxaca, Mexico and the Inside-Out residency in Bejing, China. Nicola López has participated in numerous solo and group exhibitions in prestigious galleries and museums in the United States and internationally, including MoMA, New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Museo Rufino Tamayo  in Mexico City, the Denver Art Museum, the Chazen Museum of Art, Madison, WI, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, among others.  Nicola López work is in many notable private and public collections including Chazen Museum, Madison, WI, Davison Art Center Collection at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Detroit Institute of Art, Detroit, Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Madison, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Museo Nacional de la Estampa, Mexico DF, Mexico, Museum of Modern Art, New York, and New Mexico Museum of Art, Santa Fe, to name a few.

Massimo Agostinelli,"Massimo Agostinelli is an emerging American-Italian contemporary artist born in 1987 in London, UK. Agostinelli received his BA from Leigh Gerdine College of Fine Art, Webster University, St. Louis, Missouri, before pursuing apprenticeships in printmaking at Alastair Lockhard in London, among others.  Massimo Agostinelli is best known for his Palindrome series, 2014, composed of coloured mirrored “canvas” sheets imprinted in relief with some of the most iconic image in human and art history. Agostinelli’s appropriation ranges from the Western timeline, capturing allegories from Greek mythology and Renaissance painting, through 20th Century politics, to contemporary themes. Appropriating stock images from Botticelli's The Birth of Venus to Peter Paul Rubens' Adam and Eve, each cultural snapshot is thoughtfully selected, cropped, coloured and overlaid with a unique palindromic phrase unlocking a layer of hidden meaning for each subject.  Though distinctive in expression and emotional response, and highly differing in original source, Massimo Agostinelli’s pieces are brought together by compositional uniformity and historical importance. The relation between the bravely proclaimed text and its iconic image is animated by the viewer’s individual response, he has to move in front of the mirrored reflection to catch on its multiple nature.   In May, 2015 Massimo Agostinelli held his first solo exhibition, entitled Palindromes, at Hus Gallery in London, UK. The show presented a selection of twelve works from Agostinelli's Palindromes series. Agostinelli's works have been featured in many public and private collections in Europe, North America and South Africa.  Massimo Agostinelli lives and works between London, UK and Zurich, Switzerland.",2019
Andrea Medjesi-Jones,"Andrea Medjesi-Jones is a British contemporary artist, whose paintings and drawings, placed between figurative and abstract manner, are focused on the nature of image in relation to sole material process of its making.  Although Andrea Medjesi-Jones was born in Vukovar, Croatia in 1973, her family moved to England in her early years. Andrea got her education at the Goldsmiths College in London, graduating with BA in Fine Art and Contemporary Critical Theory, and later MA in Fine Art from the same university. Recently, in 2013, Medjesi-Jones finished her PhD thesis in Contemporary Painting at the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. As a lecturer, Andrea has taught at universities in Huddersfield, Camberwell and Goldsmiths. Currently, she teaches in the Image-Object, Object-Image studio in London.  At the very base of Andrea Medjesi-Jones practice lies her interest in the image and its transience through the process of its making. Her non-representative works create a visual language of paint, reliant to material progressions, and underlined by different social and political movements and traditions of painting, such as post-war European art. Medjesi-Jones’ drawings and paintings represent a physical form of her ongoing curiosity about the long history of failed ideologies. Andrea’s almost de-material approach to the painting process highlights connections between the final image and the temporal and intuitive thought development that stands behind every artwork. By not following the rules and categorization of standardized visual narratives, the artist manages to surpass the predetermined final result. References about the historical periods, time and memory are introduced in the artworks through different material gestures, such as masking tape stencils, cut-outs, and collages. Layered and complex, Medjesi-Jones’ works suggest a strong relationship between movement and surface, where canvas is marked by various motifs and patterns, hollowed out marks and torn out masking tape and stencils. These unfinished gestures act like ghosts of the forms that never quite made the final image.   Installation titled Who is afraid of the invisible hand?, represents Andrea’s continuing exploration of connections between the image’s initial expression and the final result altered by the process of making. The installation was done in 2013 in the space of Baeckerstrasse4 Gallery, in Vienna, Austria. By altering the time-lines and localities – London and Vienna, Who is afraid of the invisible hand? installation studies the transformations of earlier conceived sketches and automatic gestural drawing done directly on the gallery wall.   Linking to the previous project Who is afraid of the invisible hand?, Andrea Medjesi-Jones’ wall-based installation named The Making of Ned Ludd explores the notion of labor as a referential value and a time-based activity that structures all social, political and individual institutions. Installed at the Bank space at the CASS in London, this work is composed from canvas tape and canvas fringing that form the letters LUDD, referencing to the Luddites movement that was active in the 19th century England. With Ned Ludd as their leader, the Luddites revolted against industrialization.  The artist made a bridge between our modern times, where physical manifestation of labor is shifted from performative action towards virtual and automated flows of information we communicate today, and the period of Luddites. With that in mind, heir direct and violent response to new technologies can now be seen as not so much a resistance to the new forms of production, but a fear of joblessness and the lack of social identity it brings. Andrea Medjesi-Jones paintings have been featured at both Jerwood Contemporary Painters and the John Moores 24 at the Liverpool Biennial, as well as Bonhams Sovereign Art Prize. Her work has been exhibited in many group shows in London, Canterbury, Liverpool, Oxford and Aberystwyth, and internationally in Houston, Lisbon, Bologna and Breda.  Andrea Medjesi-Jones lives and works in London, UK.   ",2020
Ansel Adams,"Ansel Adams was an iconic American photographer, well-known for his monumental black and white images of national parks and landscapes. Distinguished by extraordinary clarity and profundity, his photographs are amongst the most recognizable images in the world, broadly reprinted in numerous magazines, journals, and wallpapers. As an environmentalist, Ansel Adams used his images to recruit and inspire people to ecological activism and conservation of nature and wilderness. He mostly photographed nature of American West, Grand Canyon in Arizona and, his favorite, Yosemite National Park. Adams was a member of the Group f/64, an association of American photographers who made detailed and realistic work.  Ansel Adams was born in San Francisco in 1902, to a wealthy middle-class family. He was an only child and his parents continued to work in the lumber business that his father inherited. In 1906 young Ansel Adams survived a major earthquake, luckily ending up with just a few scratches and crooked nose, the later became his personal charming feature. He grew up in a house near the Golden Gate. His family struggled to maintain a certain lifestyle, that they were used to having. Adams had a nanny and a private tutor. His parents believed in traditional upbringing and were quite reserved and emotionally restricted. His crooked nose was a mark of individuality for him and combined with his conservative upbringing and natural shyness, it caused him some difficulties to fit in. Along with sentimental quirks, he also had dyslexia and that was the main reason his father took him out of school and tutored him at home. Since an early age, Adams showed a great interest in spending time outdoors. Considering he was homeschooled he spent almost every day outside, hiking and taking long walks in nature, looking at the Golden Gate sand dunes. His enthusiasm and intelligence ignited an artistic spark and when he was twelve years old he started playing the piano. At first, he was self-taught, later he worked with a tutor. Until he was eighteen years old he considered himself as a pianist, a musician, but later swapped a career in music with photography.   After realizing that hard work and self-discipline can make dreams come true, he started working on his hobby a bit more. The first camera he used was the Kodak No. 1 Box Brownie and the first scenery he photographed was at the Yosemite valley. That was his favorite place in the country, and soon after quitting his musical career he met some influential people who happened to be owners of the housing complexes in Yosemite and founders of America's earliest environmentalism movement. The club he joined when he befriended those substantial people was called the Sierra Club and in 1922 he published his first photographs in their magazine. His first exhibition also happened under the auspices of the Sierra Club, in 1928. The biggest change in his life occurred when he met a photographer Paul Strand, whose style was more realistic and clear than the pictorial one Adams was favoring at the time. He switched to clean, straight technique that required the clear lens method. After adopting different ways, he also learned how to master the skills needed in the dark room. In 1932, he joined the Group f/64 which he partially confounded with colleague and fellow artist Edward Weston. The group was short-lived but their influence, at the time, was huge. After the collective exhibition in straight photography, Adams had his first solo museum show. His love for Yosemite had to do with more than just nature, he met his lovely wife there, Virginia Best who was also a photographer. She inherited the Best' Photo studio from her father and she and Adams continued to work there.   He had a peculiar approach to a quite general philosophy of art. He almost religiously preached that the real artist must discover the beauty in the world whether that beauty is familiar or unknown. After the discovery, a good quality photo must be taken and then, the beauty must be shared. When people are looking at the wonders of nature or the beauty of just a simple spring rain, their hearts and minds almost instantly find inspiration for the next creation or just the simple enjoyment. Adams' goal was to evoke those feelings in others. His most challenging and famous piece is the The Tetons and the Snake River image, taken in 1942 in northwest Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park. Similar to other Ansel’s masterpieces, this large-scale monochromatic image displays artist’s love towards beauty, harmony, and nature. Well formed, the image highlights Adams’ great intuition for the assembly of scenes and a great sense of something higher, portraying the turning Snake River in the background of Teton mountain range. Adams also worked on fulfilling his technical knowledge all the time. Formulated by Ansel Adams and Fred Archer, a fellow photographer known for his portraits of Hollywood movie stars, the Zone System is a technique of ascertaining correct exposure in diverse working conditions, extending from the most complex lighting surroundings such as backlighting, absolute difference between light and shadow areas of a scene, and many related conditions. Based on postulates of sensitometry, Zone System works in such a way that it divides a scene into 10 zones on the tonal scale. Although the calculations were primarily based on black and white sheet film, the technique can also be used on color roll film, and even on digital photography. All images © Ansel Adams",2021
Hans Burkhardt,"Hans Gustav Burkhardt was a Swiss-born American artist, creating in Abstract Expressionism movement. Born in Basel in 1904, he emigrated to New York in 1924. Burkhardt's talent had the ability to evoke even the deepest human emotions, which resonates even today with art-lovers through his extensive body of work. That is why many art critics consider him one of the greatest artists of our time. Burkhardt was a professor at California State University, Northridge, where he had been teaching for ten years.

Arnaldo Pomodoro,"Arnaldo Pomodoro’s monumental sculptures are strange and frightening, yet beautiful. The Italian sculptor most famous for his spheres made in bronze is showing us, through his works, a structure of the life itself. The outer smoothness of his sculptures combined with the inner complicated design that looks like a clockwork machinery remind us of the intricate designs of nature and the infinite complexity of life. Pomodoro has been creating his large-scale sculptures for more than three decades and  their beauty  together with universal meaning has been accepted worldwide. His spheres, arches and disks are embellishing and completing locations in various European, American and Australian cities.   Pomodoro was born in the mid-20s in Morciano, Italy and showed interest in crafts and design quite early. However, he wasn’t directly interested in sculpture from the very beginning - in the 40s, he was working as a consultant for the restoration of public buildings  and at the same time, he was studying stage design. His curious mind was also interested in jewelry design, so he joined a goldsmith workshop and learned more about handling fine metals and decorative designs. In the 50s, he  moved to Milan, which was an important step in his career, as he started to meet a circle of the local artists there and his interest in sculpture grew stronger. His earliest work was shown at the Galleria del Naviglio in Milan in the mid-50s. Already in the late 60s, he started gaining the international reputation and traveled to galleries around Europe, United States and Brazil to exhibit his work. He even spent some time  at famous Stanford University in California, as a visiting professor. However, it wasn’t until the mid-70s that Pomodoro became renown for his unique sculptures based on geometric shapes, such as spheres, disks, pyramids or cubes, which were designed to suggest natural processes of destruction, transformation and revival.   The most famous Pomodoro’s work is called Sphere within a Sphere, also known as Sfera con Sfera in his native Italian language. It is a monumental series of sculptures featuring a large bronze sphere with seemingly damaged surface and complicated inner design consisting of another smaller, broken sphere inside. The artist created this sphere for the Vatican Church in the 60s, but due to its international popularity, Pomodoro was commissioned to build the same sculpture  for important institutions and organizations worldwide. At the moment,  Sphere within a Sphere is located at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, Trinity College in Dublin, The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, the Columbus Museum of Art, Tel Aviv University in Israel and a couple of other locations. Since the original design was created for the Vatican Church, the idea behind it is related to Christianity. Pomodoro claims that the outer sphere is the metaphor for Christianity while the inner sphere represents the Earth and people, suggesting that our world is contained within the bigger, sacred world of Catholicism. The layers of the inner sphere which contain gears are the symbol of intricacy and subtlety of our world. Pomodoro explained the motif of spheres in one of his interviews: A sphere is a marvelous object, from the world of magic and wizards. It reflects everything around it and it can easily get transformed or become invisible, leaving only its interior, tormented and corroded, full of teeth. Pomodoro feels puzzled by the perfect form of sphere and at the same time provoked to break its pristine roundness and cause the internal conflict, tension which is threatening to rip apart the entire form.   In addition to Sphere within a Sphere, Pomodoro designed  many other pieces which found their home around the globe. For example, he created a large fiberglass crucifix for the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Wisconsin. The sculpture is famous for its enormous, fourteen foot in diameter crown of thorns above the head of the Christ’s figure. In Copenhagen, Denmark in 1983 he designed a decorative pillar with a sphere on its top, called Solar Form, for the Amaliehaven park close to Amalienborg Palace. Also in 1983, he designed another geometric piece, this time a pyramid, named Forms of Myth for Brisbane's World Expo, which was bought by the City of Brisbane. Another important Pomodoro’s work featuring pyramidal shape called Wing Beat: Homage to Boccioni was built in 1984 in Los Angeles, as a part of the large fountain. In 1999, the artist opened Fondazione Arnaldo Pomodoro in Milan. This institution is performing several functions – it serves as an archive for the sculptor’s work but it is also an exhibition space since 2005, opened for the pieces of eminent Italian and international artists.   The importance of Pomodoro’s work lies in his careful observation and understanding of the relationship between the sculpture and its surrounding space. He achieved his main goal to transform already existing spaces by enriching them with his sculptures, which bring in additional layers of meaning to urban areas. The artist is exploring the shape of our world and even our mind through his sculptures which contain both polished glaze and signs of destruction. These opposing conditions underline the everlasting changes we’re exposed to and the beauty of our world which is always swinging back and forth between unity and decay. Arnaldo Pomodoro lives and works in Milan, Italy. ",2029

Born in 1922 in Snovsk, Russia, Olitski emigrated to the United States in 1923 with his mother and grandmother and settled in Brooklyn. He showed an early interest in drawing, copying a photograph of Jack Dempsey from the newspaper at age five. After high school, he won a scholarship to study art at Pratt Institute and was admitted to the National Academy of Design in New York., and later continued his education at Beaux Arts Institute in New York. Olitski's early works were full of highly colorful imagery, with links with both Parisian informel painting and American Abstract Expressionism. Throughout his career, he experimented with different methods of applying paint, using brushes, sponges, mops and rollers. From the mid-1960s, he moved away from the thick, impastoed surfaces he had been working with, beginning to spray paint onto his canvases in order to create dematerialized fields of color. In 1966, he was chosen to represent the United States in the 33rd Venice Biennale alongside Helen Frankenthaler, Roy Lichtenstein, and Ellsworth Kelly. In the 1970s, he returned to the thick impasto surfaces, but with the newly improved polymer and gel acrylic mediums.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1906, Brooks attended Southern Methodist University and the Dallas Art Institute and moved to New York in 1926 where he attended night classes at the Art Students League. During the Depression, he worked as a muralist for the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration. Between 1942 and 1945, Brooks worked as a combat artist with the American military. Based in Cairo, he traveled to Palestine, Benghazi, Libya, and other parts of Egypt during this time, photographing American military camps, the aftermath of combat, and locals, turning these photographs into drawings and gouache paintings. Having an interest in the unconscious, Brooks initially experimented with Automatism and free brushwork. Partly inspired by his friendship with Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, his works evolved into gestural abstractions of calligraphic forms and rich colors. Always experimenting with his medium, Brooks used staining, dilution, and accidental deterioration of canvases to create uncontrolled abstractions. Throughout his career, he combined accidents with deliberate choices, carefully orchestrating rhythmic compositions of abstract shapes, textures and color values in shallow space on the canvas.

Alberto Giacometti,"Emerging out of the conceptual basis of Surrealism and Cubism, Alberto Giacometti established his unique aesthetic style with delicate figurative sculptures and expressive portraits that resulted from intense observations. Particularly fascinated by Sartre’s writings for the entirety of his professional career, Giacometti was influenced by the ideas of Existentialism and wanted to make a clean and radical break with sculptural traditions that were stagnating the medium as far as this author was concerned. His artistic output is a unique mesh of ideas coming from the norms of primitive art, psychoanalytic theory and children's art - his severe figures explore the psyche and the energized space occupied by a single individual[1]. Many experts and art pundits suggest that Alberto's works can be analyzed and seen as metaphors for the postwar experience of doubt and alienation. It should also be noted that Giacometti's production extends into painting and drawing as well, but this Swiss-born and Paris-based artist is most famous for his sculpted pieces.  Alberto Giacometti was born on the 10th of October in the year of 1901, in the small mountain village of Borgonovo, Switzerland, quite near the Italian-Swiss border. His father Giovanni was an accomplished painter who worked in the Post-Impressionist style. Additionally, both his godfather and an uncle were artists as well - all three of them provided Giacometti with his earliest instructions and artistic directions. When his family moved to the nearby town of Stampa in 1906, Giacometti was already showing a strong interest in drawing. By the time he was in his early teens, Giacometti had begun painting, sculpting and making wood etchings on regular basis and enjoyed great success.[2] Pursuing a career in art making practices, Alberto moved to Geneva in 1919 where he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and École des Arts et Métiers. In 1920, he accompanied his father to the Venice Biennale and in 1921 he visited Rome, Florence and the surrounding areas[3]. During this time, Giacometti became enthralled with Egyptian and African art.  In the year of 1922, Giacometti moved to Paris to study under the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, an associate of the famous Auguste Rodin. He spent the next four years he studied sculpture at the Académie de la Grande-Chaumière. In the City of Light, Alberto experimented with Cubism and Surrealism, soon coming to be regarded as one of the leading surrealist sculptors. He met and worked with the likes of Joan Miró, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Bror Hjorth and Balthus. Giacometti started nurturing his newfound love for primitive art and his representations of the human body were becoming steadily more abstracted. By the time he graduated, Alberto completely abandoned any realism in his work and instead constantly aimed at conveying the psychological essence of his subject matter[4]. Two of his most important and representative works from this period are the famous Spoon Woman and The Couple.   In the early 1930s, Giacometti’s emerging style and its uncompromising nature endeared him to some of the Surrealist movement’s most important figures such as André Breton, Man Ray and Georges Bataille. Their massive influence on his work can be seen in such dreamlike, metaphorical pieces as Suspended Ball (1931), Walking Woman I (1932) and The Palace at 4 a.m. (1932). However, the personal inquiry into the nature of existence would ultimately lead Alberto away from the art of Surrealism. During the latter half of the fourth decade of the 20th century, Giacometti focused his energies on a series of head sculptures that were meant to convey his own physical relation to his models in space[5]. Unfortunately, when he was at the personal peak of creative endeavors, the outbreak of World War II and the advance of the German army into France forced Giacometti to flee Paris and return to Switzerland[6]. During this time, his sculptures became thin and increasingly small in size, lending the figures an air of loneliness and suffering.   After Giacometti returned to Paris following the end of the war, he soon found out that his earlier pieces and the existentialist philosophies behind them were already quite popular in the capital of France. His new pieces struck a chord with the pervasive postwar feelings of despair and loneliness. Now highly sought after by both the museums and collectors, Alberto's work earned him solo exhibitions in New York City in 1948 and 1950. His art became a symbol of just how big a toll the German horrors took on the whole of Europe and Giacometti was oftentimes described as always halfway between nothingness and being. During the 1950s, Giacometti’s work continued to evolve constantly as his sculptures were becoming larger, thinner and more complicated in design[7]. Additionally, he also undertook a series of dark, intense portraits of family members, primarily his wife, Annette whom he married in 1949 and his brother Diego. He also portrayed some of his well-known friends such as Jean Genet, Henri Matisse and Igor Stravinsky.   Internationally famous by 1965, Giacometti had many opportunities in the mature period of his life. He began a lengthy period of illustrated works for books by contemporary authors such as Paul Eluard and revered writers of the past like Cervantes and Balzac. He was also commissioned by Samuel Beckett to create a tree sculpture for a production of his Waiting for Godot and in 1962 he was awarded the Grand Prize for Sculpture at the Venice Biennale. This was a true crown of his career as Alberto revered Venice Biennale ever since the time his father took him along on the festival. Two years later, he received the Guggenheim International Award for Painting that was followed by retrospectives of his work at the Tate Gallery[8] in London and the Museum of Modern Art[9] in New York. Unfortunately, by that time, his health was already quite bad. Alberto Giacometti died of cardiac exhaustion on the 11th of January in the year of 1966, in Chur, Switzerland.   Ultimately, Alberto Giacometti managed to do what he always desired the most - to inspire and put into motion a radical revision of the representational tradition in sculpture. This evolution within one of the most conventional mediums can be seen as a key moment of shifting enthusiasms within European art after the Second World War and Giacometti led the way for others emerging from that crucial period of 20th-century art. Alberto devised controversial and innovative sculptural forms unlike anything else on the scene, oftentimes reminiscent of toys and games, dictating the future of sculpture as a form of art. His works, whether sculpted or drawn on paper, summed up the artist's interests in perception, sexuality, obsession, alienation, innovation and anxiety, effectively turning Giacometti into a household name of modern art that won't be forgotten anytime soon.

Giorgio Morandi,"A 20th-century master of the painted still life, Italian painter and printmaker Giorgio Morandi built his distinguished reputation by painting subtle, tonal and simple depictions of everyday household objects. His oil paintings usually featured arrangements of vases and bowls, rendered in such a fashion that they have low levels of color saturation and subtle tonal variation, underlined by the artist’s understated paint handling. Heavily influenced by the Post-Impressionist style and early Cubist painters, Morandi developed a simple style that he maintained and stayed true to throughout his life, continuing to depict the same assortments of ceramic vessels in countless variations and arrangements, stubbornly refusing to surrender his visuals to the pressures of the avant-garde society.  Giorgio Morandi was born in the town of Bologna to Andrea Morandi and Maria Maccaferri - initially, he lived on Via Lame where his brother Giuseppe and his sister Anna were born. Later his family moved to Avesella where two additional sisters were born in 1900 and 1906. From 1907 to 1913, Morandi studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna (Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna) where he learned many aspects of art making that served him well in the long run. Following the death of his father in 1909, Giorgio moved to via Fondazza and Morandi effectively became the head of the family[1]. During that time, Morandi taught himself to etch by studying books on Rembrandt. Although he lived his whole life in and around Bologna, Giorgio was massively influenced by the works of Paul Cezanne, Andre Derain and Pablo Picasso.  After a quick stint with the Futurist style in 1914, Morandi joined the army in 1915 but suffered a breakdown and was indefinitely discharged. During the time of the war, Morandi's still lifes became more reduced in their compositional elements and started to show a pureness in form. Soon after the World War I ended, Morandi was appointed instructor of drawing for elementary schools in Bologna - he held this post until the year of 1929. The Metaphysical painting or Pittura Metafisica phase in Morandi's work lasted from 1918 to 1922 and this was followed by what will prove to be his last major stylistic shift[3]. After it, Giorgio focused increasingly on subtle gradations of hue, tone and objects that were arranged in a unifying atmospheric haze[2] - this stylistic direction will be his choice of work for the rest of Morandi's life.  Although Morandi showed his paintings in the Novecento Italiano exhibitions of 1926 and 1929, he was more specifically associated with the regional Strapaese group. This fascist-influenced group was emphasizing local cultural traditions and were known to get quite radical when it came to their beliefs. Giorgio was sympathetic to the Fascist party in the 1920s but still had many friendships with anti-Fascist figures.[4] From 1928, Morandi participated in some of the famous Venice Biennale exhibitions, as well as in the Quadriennale in Rome and in different Italian and foreign cities.  The scattered palette, distinct lines and careful brushstroke of Morandi's still lifes are unmistakably modern in style. His work may be grounded in familiar and universal forms, but the way he painted suggest an autobiographical quality - his careful paint handling and attention to an identifiable Italian quality of light made his still life and landscape work truly stick out. Interestingly, he never stopped being completely engaged with his own pictorial experiments[5], even when the contemporary art movements of the avant-garde currents were overwhelmingly interested in abstract painting.   In 1948, Venice Biennale awarded Giorgio Morandi first prize for painting. He visited Paris for the first time in 1956 and, during the following year, he won the grand prize in São Paulo's Biennial. He held etching lections at the Accademia di Belle Arti until 1956. Quiet and polite both in his private and public life, Morandi was much talked about in Bologna for his enigmatic personality. He was a well-liked person in his town and was regarded as a local celebrity. Morandi died of lung cancer on the 18th of June 18 in 1964. He lived on Via Fondazza, in Bologna, with his three sisters Anna, Dina and Maria Teresa.  Giorgio is also an interesting artist to study from an entire art history standpoint - still lifes are one of the most conventional and everlasting subgenres of painting and by investigating and comparing Morandi's work to pieces that were made centuries or more ago, we get an interesting insight of how the authors from different eras tackled the same themes and sets of problems[6].   In more ways than one, Giorgio Morandi's work can be interpreted as a peaceful rejection of the turbulent and fast-paced modern world in which the artist lived, as well as an internal reflection on life itself. It can also be analyzed from a purely superficial aspect, as the following statement by the painter himself may imply: I believe that nothing can be more abstract, more unreal, than what we actually see. Regardless of the desired approach to interpreting his art, there is no denying that Morandi's painting of the unremarkable is a valuable element of the 20th-century modern art.  References:   ",2049

After studying at the Berlin-Weissensee School of Art, the artists graduated under the tutelage of Prof Alex Jordan in 2010. Various & Gould are known for constantly reinventing themselves. Their creation is based on the simple but striking formula 1+1=3. Whilst methods of screen-printing and collage are their specialty, their art can also emerge in a public performance or an installation as they like crossing borders and do not stick to a certain medium. Mutual passions including their love of paper, enthusiasm for accidental beauty in everyday life and art in urban space form the core of their artistic practice. Various & Gould often deal with socially prominent themes such as work, migration, (sexual) identity, death, religion or the ﬁnancial crisis in a playful, intuitive manner. Inﬂuenced by (political) poster graphics, Dada and Pop Art, vivid colors combined with typography and encrypted messages are the characteristics of their work.  This most recent series presents character studies in the form of collaged heads. Looking for ﬁctional individuals the artist duo assembles varied facial parts inventing new characters along the lines of an identikit picture catalogue. Only at second glance the particular facial elements can be detected and become gradually visible. With their Dadaist patchwork identities Various & Gould subvert common beauty ideals and celebrate human diversity. Even if their characters are ﬁctional and bear no name they appear more realistic and authentic than many of the glossy beauty faces represented in the daily news. By transferring the series into the public space, the common media representation of humans are declared war on.  „For those of you familiar with the mix-n-match limbs, torsos, and heads that V&G have used previously, you can see that the innovative experimenters have evolved their collage style to something new. It’s exactly the same, but completely different. “ - Jaime Rojo & Steven P. Harrington, Brooklyn Street Art, NYC, 2015.  The series refers to the ""Broken Windows Theory"" by the social scientists Wilson and Kelling (1982) saying that a broken window of an abandoned building acts as the trigger for the general increase in crime in the neighborhood. The theory set the foundation for the ""zero tolerance” strategy which led to increased police presence and rigorous prosecution of petty offences. For the series artists were invited to smash a window with a chosen object in several tosses - the shape of the shattered pane was then utilized as a template. Through the use of semi-transparent spray paint and the hole in the glass, the superposition of abstract color ﬁelds on the screen is formed. The destructive act of demolition is converted into a constructive work and a metaphor for the general emergence of creative processes in the urban context. ""When I was a teenager I used to throw stones to the windows of empty trains, when they were passing by. They were empty trains nobody was traveling there. But I remember that for a certain reason. Of course it was related with the cheap life that I was having. I was feeling some kind of relief and it was taking pain away from me through the act of destroying a window. Vandalism in the pure form."" - From the project's guided interview with Alaniz, Berlin, 2014   This portrait series comprises 13 known, living and nonconformist people who cross borders and act as pioneers on controversial social issues. The idea that these people might have been persecuted and burned as witches in earlier times is a mere speculation. The fact that they still have to ﬁght for their ideas, freedom, dignity or even their lives, is the sad truth. For the portraits a particular ink was used allowing– as if by witchcraft – the ignition of matches on the actual artworks. By using these matches and candles the observers are encouraged to get involved with the image. The series is presented in an interactive form both in the gallery and as a public street installation called ""WitchHunt”. “A riveting interactive witch hunt, complete with matches, candles, smart phones and QR codes, has just begun on the streets of Berlin [...] You know many of the 13 ‘witches’, as they are people from modern times who have suffered fates of being accused and depicted as evil.” - Steven P. Harrington, Brooklyn Street Art, NYC, 2013   This screen-print series consisting of 10 Holy Helpers is named after the ﬁctional patron Sankt Nimmerlein (translated to Saint Neverever) and is based on the traditional depiction of Christian saints. Each print deals with a particular relevant social issue such as climate change, globalization or the ﬁnancial crisis. Due to the high complexity and ambivalence of these topics, they require being discussed and considered from different point of views. „Inspired by the representation of Christian saints, with a great sense of humor and passion for detail they impersonate the great conﬂicts of the 21st century [...]. Hence, Saint Gentriﬁcian is appointed to a contemporary hood saint - a patron for squatters, demonstrators, masked man/woman, graffiti sprayer, urban sociologist, cyclist and pedestrian.""  Alain Bieber, art - das Kunstmagazin, 2010  The ongoing series consists of ﬁgurative screen-print collages inspired by the spirit of Dada and Surrealism.

Physical work becomes increasingly invisible and more difficult to grasp or comprehend. The Rabotniki ﬁgures also seem as they have fallen out of time, appearing alienated but nevertheless proud and conﬁdent.  Whatever the Rabotniki are working on, they do it with heart, sweat and soul. “A world where workers trade body parts [...] moving in tandem while performing their repetitive tasks in a choreographed ‘workers waltz’. Using found objects, work related symbols and their reﬁned silkscreen techniques, the line between work and play becomes blurred inside the imaginative minds of Various & Gould.” - Rae McGrath, Brooklynite Gallery, NYC, 2010   This project discusses the topic of immigration, identities and clichés. Identities are highly complex and always diverse whereas clichés are the embodiment of simpliﬁcation. In view of immigration, more and more people have patchwork identities which are often encountered with prejudices by others. To visualize this issue Various & Gould have produced portraits of well-known German, French and American personalities with migration background. Based on a technique known from children's books, faces and words are horizontally cut into strips enabling to rearrange them in endless variations. There are so many options - some make sense, some do not and a few invoke images confronting the viewer with own stereotypes. „By montaging various, also gender-connoted, details of portraits and text fragments [...] in a silk-screening process, they contradict superﬁcial identitarian notions of the construction of the subject. Some details offer possibilities for identiﬁcation; others do not, leading to an interrogation of phantasms of identiﬁcation.“ - Sønke Gau & Katharina Schlieben,  Katalog „Help! – Soziale Appelle im Plakat“, Museum für Gestaltung Zürich, 2009.

Jean Arp,"Easily considered to be one of those rare one-man movement occasions in art history, Jean Arp was a pioneer of what we now call abstract expression. His impressive paintings, reliefs and sculptures introduced many innovative thoughts, such as the incorporation of waste materials and spontaneity as integral components of the artistic process. Furthermore, Arp explored the potentials behind unique compositional relationships that emerge from the inadvertent arrangements of elements within the piece's structure. This resulted in Jean's famed biomorphic sculptures which were inspired by organic material and the human figure despite being wrapped in a heavily abstract cloth. Because of such an approach, Arp's art was strongly relying on the concepts of transformation, growth and metamorphosis.   Jean Arp was born during the year of 1886, in the city of Strasbourg, the capital of the Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine region in the northeastern France. His mother was a native French woman and his father was of German origin, a mixed heritage which often brought young Arp in a situation of not being sure if his real name was Jean or Hans. This was eventually settled by the French law following the end of World War I when it was decided that the young man's one and true name must be Jean. Whilst still in his teen years, Arp went to Paris where he published his poetry for the first time in 1904, announcing his arrival to the creative scene of the City of Lights. For the next three years, he studied at the Kunstschule in Weimar, but yet again left for Paris in 1908. There, he studied at the famed Académie Julian. While still in the French capital, Arp was a founder and a member of the Moderne Bund in Lucerne, a group of young avant-garde artists who exhibited occasionally between the years of 1911 and 1913. Somewhere during that time, Jean met Wassily Kandinsky, the influential Russian painter and art theorist. Inspired by the views on art the Russian presented him with, Arp decided he would seek similar expression in his own work[1]. Through his friendship with Kandinsky, Jean also met the likes of Henri Matisse and Robert Delaunay. In 1913, Jean was pressured by the rising tension between the Europe's nations. Feeling that a war may occur at one point, scared Arp moved to Switzerland in order to take advantage of the Swiss neutrality. And as the chance would have it, Jean was proven to be right in 1914.   After his arrival to Switzerland, Arp found a group of similar minded individuals who shared his avant-garde outlook on art. There, Jean was one of the founding members of the Dada movement in Zürich in the year of 1916[2]. During that time, he decided to go with his alternative name of Hans. Alongside Max Ernst and the social activist Alfred Grünwald, he set up the Cologne Dada group which, although rather inferior to the Zürich department, was rather influential in its own right. By working on Dadaistic concepts, Arp was a pivotal part of the first radical and genuine avant-garde movement Europe has ever seen. His further involvement with the modern art phenomenon was extended in 1925 when Jean was featured in the first exhibition of the surrealist group at the Galérie Pierre in Paris. Inspired by the attention he received from the Surrealist artists, Arp moved to the Paris suburb of Meudon the next year. In the year of 1931, Arp decided to break his bonds with the Surrealist movement in order to establish the Paris-based group Abstraction-Création. Jean also expanded his efforts from collage and reliefs to bronze and stone sculptures at this time[3]. His advanced mindset even made possible something very ahead of his time - Arp produced several small works made of multiple elements that the viewer could actually pick up, separate and rearrange into new configurations. Throughout the 1930s, Jean wrote and published essays and poetry as well, something he did for the rest of his days. His expansion over the Atlantic happened in 1949 when Arp held a solo exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery in New york City. He also won many awards in this mature period of his career, highlighted by the Grand Prize for sculpture at the 1954 Venice Biennale and the 1963 Grand Prix National des Arts. Arp died in the year of 1966, in Basel, Switzerland. He left behind him an incredible array of artworks and a legacy which will echo throughout the rest of modern art. Jean Arp's written words also had a massive impact on the generations of artists after his time, effectively making sure that he still had a say in many creative matters from the second half of the 20th century.   Ultimately, Arp’s articulation of biomorphic forms had a massive impact on virtually all later 20th-century abstract artists[4]. Furthermore, his work was instrumental in the founding of the Dada movement, as well as rather pivotal in Surrealism and Constructivism. This kind of influence only further cements Jean Arp's name in artist history as he can easily be considered to be one of the most substantial and influential creative minds early twentieth century had to offer. Whether he was making sculptures or collages, wrote poems or discussed creative theories, or was simply drawing random forms on a piece of paper - absolutely all Arp authored was underlined by the note of originality and modern creativity.

He once said that his art comes to life neither to be self-satisfactory nor to play a role in the arts. He simply plunges into the unknown. This artist uses the unconventional as a theme for his work while embracing painting as a platform to express himself - Garcia. At the same time, he explores the contemporary socio-political climate. Sergio’s sculptures depicting tricycles are created to manipulate viewers' traditional expectations of his familiar, childhood toy, based on memory and nostalgia.  “I enjoy creating art that people can relate to and that stimulates the creative subconscious. Not only to create an emotional relationship between art and viewer, but to conjure up questions of how and why.” His delightfully distorted tricycles, figures, and other objects are presented at the exhibition titled Infinite Chapters, his solo show at White Walls Gallery at San Francisco in 2014.

Peter Combe,"Peter Combe is a Canadian-British contemporary artist and photographer known for his 3 dimensional artworks made of collaged paint chips. Based in San Francisco since 2008, Combe has focused his practice around explorations into multi-disciplinary aspects of working with paper as a medium through which the artist envelops the aesthetics of the other mediums including painting, sculpture, photography and digital-media.  Peter Combe creates a three-dimensional images using household paint swatches as a basic material, regularly hand-punched into small coloured disks. He places these commercially produced paint-samples into bevel-cut grooves on a specially prepared archival material so that the colours he selects appear at 45 degree angles and the reverse side of each colour-swatch. The artist engages the sculptural possibilities of disks building the illusion of images that appear to move and change depending on the viewer's perspective. From a distance, Combe’s subjects gaze at the viewer while, upon closer inspection, the stunning details - looking like colorful, perfectly circular fish scales - expose themselves showing integral part of Combe's image.    Peter Combe’s work range from abstract pattern-based color compositions to realistic portraits of people. Apart from producing portraits commissioned by collectors, many of Combe’s subjects are sourced from online social media, especially Instagram. By inserting the chips into a surface Combe makes pixelated representations of his subjects, the recreation of a photographs. In order to create portraits made from paint swatches, Peter Combe works speedily, thinking of tones rather than colors. For this reason he has organized his palette of over 1,100 colors into 28 groups based on tonal increments and light-reflecting values. The playful tension produced between the three-dimensional appearance of the portraits and the visual flattening that occurs through the digital references made in Combe's recent works are part of his ongoing examinations into the material characteristics that define ephemerality and permanence as well as representation and abstraction.   Combe’s works is in many public and private collections including Laurence Hallier, Los Angeles; David Kensington, San Francisco; David Nazarian, Los Angeles; Sam Nazarian, Las Vegas; Mark Smucker, Ohio; and Chris Viehbacher, Boston. Peter Combe has participated in many individual and collective exhibitions in the USA and abroad, including at Robert Fontaine Gallery, Miami, FL; Back Gallery Project, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Luhring Augustine Gallery, New York, NY; Andrea Schwartz Gallery, San Francisco, CA; Galerie C.O.A, Montréal, QC, Canada; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Museum of Fine Art, Florida State University, FL; and Centre de Cultura Contemporania de Barcelona, Barcleona, Spain, among others.

Roni Horn,"Through photography, sculptures, photography, and literature, American artist Roni Horn questions the nature of identity, perception, and meaning. Born in 1955 in New York, she studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and later at the Yale School of Art, where she received the master's degree. Since the beginning of the 1980s, the artist has produced works that have emotional and psychological dimensions. Horn often describes her work as ‘site-dependent’ and ""moody"". Today a Horn's auction draws a lot of attention and her works can be found in many major public collections, including Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection in New York, The Netherlands and Kunstmuseum, Basel, MoMA in New York, and the Museum Krüller-Müller in The Netherlands.   Roni Horn has had a close relationship with Iceland since her first trip there in the 1970s. After traveling the island on her motorbike, she fell in love with the untouched nature that possesses a strong sense of timelessness. It inspired the series of books titled To Place. Among them are a series of graphite and watercolor drawings titled Bluff Life, a photographic essay Arctic Circles and the To Place: Verne's Journey featuring the boundless horizon of the North Sea. In 2006 To Place was voted among the most important artistic books in history. Over the years, Horn regularly returned to Island, for it turned out to be an endless source of inspiration. The artist created works that perfectly depicted the cyclical relationship between nature and humankind. The permanent installation titled Some Thames (2000) features eighty photographs of water, which can be seen at the University of Akureyri in Iceland. Roni pays close attention to the quality of the materials, no matter the mediums. In her rich oeuvre, she has used a variety of materials, including rubber, glass, texture pigment, and gold. The artist draws inspiration from nature, whether it is the weather, or humans as well as poetry and literature. Roni has caught the eye of the public in the 80s after having exhibitions at both Leo Castelli Gallery and Paula Cooper in New York. Among her most memorable installations are You Are the Weather—Munich (1996) at the Deutscher Wetterdienst bureau in Munich, and the Library of Water (2007), Artangel’s first international commission, now located at the Stykkishólmur, Iceland. It is important to note that the installation was created by using the water from the Icelandic glacier.   Roni Horn creates artworks that strongly communicate with the viewers by installing pieces in different rooms or opposing walls. The artist does not believe that when observing the work of art, everybody shares the same experience, for it is influenced by time and space itself.  Whenever a Horn's auction is announced, her artworks are quickly sold out. The artist had exhibitions all around the world, but the first solo exhibition was held at the Kunstraum München in the 80s. Among the group exhibitions are Venice Biennale (1997), and Whitney Biennial two times. A survey show of Roni’s oeuvre organized by Whitney Museum of American Art in 2009 has traveled to several major institutions, including Tate Modern, London, Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and the Collection Lambert in Avignon. Roni Horn lives and works in Iceland and New York. ",2076
Dalek,"James Marshall, aka Dalek, is an American painter, best known for his Space Monkey, a “grinning and malevolent” version of a human being. Apart from painting, Dalek is also known for Photography, Murals, and Illustrations. Marshall was born on May 22, 1968, in New London, CT. Since he was raised by a military family, he grew up moving around the East Coast a lot. For a while, Dalek even lived abroad and graduated from a high school in Japan. In his search for voice and identity, the artist became a part of many subcultures, such as graffiti, punk rock, and skateboarding. He began his education at Virginia Commonwealth University, from which he graduated in 1992, gaining a BA in Sociology and Anthropology. Three years later, in 1995, the artist acquired his BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  Drawing from his experiences and passions, Dalek started working on his Space Monkey, a character that would soon become synonymous with his name. It was completed in 1995, and in this artwork, Marshall incorporated his love for pop culture, the “vibe” of the punk scene, street art and cartoons. The curious thing about this artwork is that it is not a monkey at all, but a mouse, or rather, Marshall’s concept of a human being. Space Monkey became Dalek’s alter ego, a medium through which he expressed his emotions.   2001 proved to be a significant year in Dalek’s career. In August, the Boston Museum organized a show, displaying the works of Takashi Murakami, which Marshall visited. Realizing that he still needed some sort of articulation when it comes to his own art, and finding it within Murakami’s works, Dalek started his apprenticeship with the renowned Japanese painter. Another turning point in Dalek’s career was in 2007, when he had an exhibition, titled Desperate, Rejected and Angry in New York. The exhibition marked the change in many aspects of Dalek’s art: his paintings became deeper, layered and far more complex, and he also switched to his real name. His trademark monkey disappeared from his paintings or was only partially there.   Characteristic for Marshall’s new style is that it has become purely abstract. There is an abundance of flashing colors and multiple planes. Space Monkey is, to a degree, still present in his new paintings, since it provides a base. His paintings now represent the never-ceasing conflicting forces of the universe, which cancel and balance each other out. Dalek has been praised by many critics, and his artworks have been featured in numerous publications, articles, and magazines, such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Juxtapoz, etc. He has also participated in numerous one-person and group shows all over the US, Japan, and Europe.

Dolk,"Dolk Lundgren is the most famous Norwegian stencil and graffiti artist, whose artwork is motivated by pop culture. He is better known as just Dolk, his pseudonym, which means dagger or knife when translated into English. The talent and respect this man has, is best described by his mates from vandal school, who voted Dolk as ‘most likely to succeed’. Sexual motives are the usual ingredient of Lundgren’s art, which he skillfully includes into a humorous and critical context. The artist gives an advantage to black and white style, because of its impact, and speed needed to finish a piece. The idea of his artwork is to send the message of love, hate, and dreams, basically whatever he feels in the moment.  Dolk was born in Oslo, the capital of Norway in 1979, but he grew up in Bergen. Before discovering stencils art, he studied graphic design in Melbourne. It was in 2003 when he met street art for the first time, after being inspired by the world’s most famous street artist, Banksy. At the beginning of his career, people thought that Dolk is actually the pseudonym for the Bristol-based stencils artist, but he soon proved them wrong and became the masters of his own right. A huge gratitude the artist owes to Wooster Collective and Pictures on Wall (POW), who helped him introduce his work with masses. Dolk describes his hobbies as sex, sex, and vandalism, and continuous by adding paintings, stencils and exploring as his interests. His goal is to travel and be able to live by selling his artwork. The reason the artist has chosen stencil art, rather than graffiti, is because of it raw and dirty look, and because the latter one belongs to the underground, hereof it is harder to interpret to ordinary people. Dolk’s stencils are appealing to a larger crowd, where both elders and children laugh at his work and understand the message he wants to send.     In 2006 Dolk makes a decision to swap the street for gallery walls, and end his underground style of doing illegal works. His remarkable early print releases like Puppy Love, Che, and Burger King, enabled him to participate at Santa’s Ghetto’ festival in London. Che- featuring a cigar-smoking Che Guevara proudly pointing to his t-shirt, emblazoned with Jim Fitzpatrick's rendering of Alberto Korda’s (in)famous 1960 image of Che Guevara, and Burger King - featuring Prince Charles wearing a Burger King crown against a blue backdrop, were quite a refreshment due to the lack of Banksy’s work in 2006. In 2008 Dolk and Pøbel started a new project called Ghetto Spedalsk with the aim to expand urban art to no man’s land in the far Norway’s north, by painting 20 stencils on abandoned house. In 2010 the exercise yard of the Halden prison in Norway was decorated with three large scale murals made by Dolk. One piece represented a prisoner in classic striped uniform complete with ball and chain, another print displayed a runner about to cross a finishing line made of police do not cross tape. During 2011 he had the honor to put up his artwork at the main train stations in Oslo and Trondheim.   Dolk’s prints, canvases, murals and hand-made posters received a huge attention not only in Norway but in other countries as well. Dolk's murals can be seen on walls in cities such as Melbourne, Copenhagen, London, Oslo, Lisbon, Stockholm, Barcelona, Prague, and Berlin. His first solo exhibition was in Oslo in 2011 at the OSL Contemporary Gallery. In 2012 he decorated the walls of the Norwegian School of Economics as a part of the project ……….Capitalism. Since 2006 he is a regular participant of the Nuart Festival in Stavanger, Norway. In 2008 his work was displayed at the Cans Festival in London.  ",2078

Jason Woodside,"Jason Woodside is a prolific artist whose refreshing paintings and murals can be found throughout New York City, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Paris. His work is based on bold geometric shapes, vibrant and hypnotizing patterns as well as striking color combinations. Woodside finds the inspiration for his art in textiles and clothings and he has transformed some of his pieces into outfits during the collaboration with the most prestigious fashion brands such as Adidas and OBEY. Woodside is also known as one of the key personalities belonging to the post-graffiti movement.  Woodside is originally from Miami, but he came to New York City following his dream about pursuing a career in the movie industry. At the same time, he wasn't interested only in the world of movies - he attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City, which made him aware of his passion for painting. However, Woodside wasn't too much into formal education. After a while. he dropped out of school and discovered that his greatest talent lies in creating street art and covering the urbanscapes of NYC with his trademark mix of bold colors and patterns. He likes to see his contribution to the local street art scene as a sparkling sunshine from his native Florida brought to the concrete jungle of NYC. Indeed, Woodside's colorful patterns exude optimism and brighten up those neverending gray walls of the Big Apple.   Woodside’s work features recognizably vivid and optimistic colors, combined with the contrasting layers of geometric patterns. His playful approach creates a strong visual cohesion and all of his pieces have a significant decorative feel. He prefers creating large-scale artworks because they have a stronger impact on the viewer's mood. Woodside's large swirls of colors and intricate patterns are like an unstoppable river able to carry the viewer into the different, more lively and more enthusiastic state of mind. It is known that colors have a definite therapeutic value and Woodside wants to help people feel better and more wholesome while enjoying his pieces. It is not surprising that many big names in the fashion industry recognized the great potential of Woodside's cheerful and bright artworks.   Woodside pushes the boundaries of the traditional street art while creating his easily recognizable pieces, which are light years away from the standard graffiti and murals. At the same time, he is extremely successful in building a beautiful and highly functional bridge between the innovative street art and more commercial fashion design. The artist has achieved many collaborations and commissions in the recent couple of years, such as incorporating his pieces into the repertoire of the famous brands such as Collee, Adidas, Saatchi & Saatchi, Haydenshapes and Obey Clothing. However, he remained dedicated to his large-scale works and still enjoys painting murals in the major cities of Europe, the United States, and Australia. The artist is represented by Street Art Anarchy.  Featured image : Woodside's portrait - via urbanoutfitters.com All images courtesy of the artist.",2080
Giovanni Battista Piranesi,"Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi was one of the most renowned printmakers of the 18th century. As an architect and archeologist, he created an extensive oeuvre of drawings depicting views in and around Rome. Etchings in Neoclassicism style depict atmospheric ""prisons"" (Carceri d'Invenzione), contributed to the fame of Rome, and spurred the growth of archaeology. The artist carefully examined the ancient antiquities and Baroque and Renaissance structures. With multiple vanishing points, Piranesi manipulated the scale and perspective of well-known buildings. Thanks to his deep understanding of architectural principles, his work put Rome on the map for its remarkable architecture. Giovanni Battista Piranesi (born in 1720 in Venice) began working for the Venetian ambassador when he was 20 years old. Under the mentorship of Giuseppe Vasi, he learned everything about engraving and etching and found his lifelong calling. He added an artistic flair to his work, creating original etching techniques that featured sharp contrasts of dark and light, rich textures. Even though he considered himself first and foremost an architect, he only received one commission to restore the church of Santa Maria del Priorato. The artist became renowned for creating more than 2000 etchings of prisons in which he converted the Roman ruins into dungeons full of torture contraptions and mysterious scaffolding. The series Le antichità romane (1756) and the Vedute di Roma (1748 – 1778) are considered some of his finest works. Piranesi possessed an eye for details which enabled him to create plates that showed his expression of the structures' dramatic grandeur. Primarily created for the tourist market, these works revolutionized how Rome was depicted and became one of the most important documents of the 18th century. Piranesi greatly manipulated the reality of the ruins he depicted. Thanks to his background in architecture, he was able to add missing details, such as tombs, vases, and alters. Thus his work featured views of buildings in their full glory, capturing perfectly the distribution of light and shadow that added to the whole picture. The artist often added human figures of children, beggars, and drunks to add to the atmosphere of a once-thriving city now lost to the past. Here the influence of Renaissance literature and its depiction of the transience of human existence is best seen. His pupils completed Piranesi's later work, and his son Francesco preserved many of his etchings. In the 18th century, many of the ancient ruins were left abandoned. For the artist, it was essential to capture them as accurately and realistically as possible in his work so that they are preserved and in some way saved for future generations. For his contributions, he was invited to join the Society of Antiquaries of London and was the Director of the Portici Museum. As most of the ancient structures have disappeared, Piranesi's work gives us a glimpse into the forgotten past and has served as inspiration for countless generations of artists. Giovanni Battista Piranesi passed away in 1778. Featured image: Giovanni Battista Piranesi - S. Giovanni in Laterano. Interior (detail). Captions, via Creative Commons   ",2081
Otto Schade,"Otto Alexis Schade López, better known as Otto Schade, or simply OSCH, is a Chilean-German architect and artist, best known for his unique paintings, where he perfectly fuses abstract and surreal art. He is also an avid street artist, photographer and sculptor, and has even done some work in collage, prints, drawing and installation.  Otto Schade was born on October 30th, 1971 in Chile. His talent was evident even from an early age, when he started drawing. Otto spent his academic years at Bio Bio University, studying Architecture, and Construction and Design Architecture in Concepcion, Chile. He never had any formal art education, but sometime around his graduation in 1995, he took up oil painting classes, which helped him a lot develop his artistic expression.  Even though Otto received numerous awards for his architectural achievements working on both public and private projects, the Chilean finds his greatest passion to be painting. Through his artwork, Schade tries to “break the flatness of a canvas”, as he puts it. His style blurs the boundaries between surrealism and abstract, enabling him to perfectly capture and display his obsessions and dreams. In the abstract part of his paintings, Schade has been experimenting with layers, creating deepness in his spatial representations. Sometimes, his artwork is inspired by political issues. Having grown up under the dictatorship of Pinochet, Schade learned to think as a rebel, and produce his work as a reaction to a system. Otto’s paintings are unique in style with a refined technique – often characterized by ribbons which are painted meticulously in layers to produce his imagery. As his greatest source of inspiration, he cites painters like Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, M. C. Escher and Roberto Matta – the effect these artists have on Otto are especially noticeable in his surrealist paintings. The artist’s main choice of surface is canvas, though sometimes he chooses board, and since he started creating murals and graffiti, the walls of numerous cities became his “second canvas”.  Although Schade has been painting since 1996, his murals began to appear in East London around 2009. Since then, he has gained an enormous fanbase worldwide. Just like with his paintings, Otto’s murals combine the imagination of surrealism and the freedom that abstract art provides. His highly detailed trademark ribbons are there as well. Many factors are at play when it comes to realization of Schade’s ideas. They sometimes depend on the wall itself. Once an idea is shaped, he sketches the image on a piece of paper, prints it, and cuts the pieces using a laser, due to the complexity of stencils. When the spraying is done, he uses markers to shade the ribbon-structures, giving them depth and a three-dimensional appearance.  Apart from painting and murals, Schade also creates collages, illustrations, sculptures, photographs and prints.  Schade’s artistic journey and pursuit of new ideas and inspirations has taken him around the world. He has exhibited in cities like Berlin, London, New York, Moscow, Amsterdam and Concepcion, to name a few. Some of his more notable one-person exhibitions include Exposition, held in Luxemburg, and Orbs and Ribbons, hosted by Fabrik Gallery in Hong Kong, in 2014. Otto has also participated in numerous collaborative shows and art festivals, like the 2014 Around the Block at Well Hung Gallery, London and the 2012 Urban Barrier exhibition at Ben Oakley Gallery.  His pieces are a part of many public and private collections – some of his more famous collectors include Queen’s Brian May, Jamie Oliver, Naomi Campbell, and the British Prime Minister David Cameron. He is represented by Ministry of Walls gallery. Since 2006, Otto Schade has been living and working in London, UK.",2082

George Segal,"American pop artist George Segal is best known for his signature figurative sculptures. Made out of cast plaster and often situated in mundane environments, they mimic everyday life, historical events, and cinematic scenes. The artist's work is a haunting depiction of American life in the 20th century. Today Segal's artworks are part of over a hundred private and public collections, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,  the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. George Segal was born in 1924 in the Bronx and studied at Cooper Union, Pratt Institute, and New York University, where his teachers were Tony Smith and William Baziotes. In 1949 he graduated from NYU with a BA in Art Education and bought a chicken farm in South Brunswick with his wife. There, for several years, he taught at the local school and entertained on his farm all the artists he met during his time in NY. In 1958 the renowned artist Allan Kaprow had his first Happening at the farm that later became Segal's 6,000-square-foot studio. Through Kaprow, Segal met John Cage and eventually participated in Cage's experimental composition classes. In 1956, the artist, who became a member of the New York avant-garde scene, specifically the legendary 10th Street scene, had his first solo exhibition. There he showcased a series of figurative abstract paintings. Two years later, he began creating sculptures using plaster and chicken wire.   In 1961 the artist was asked to test the usage of Johnson & Johnson's newly developed gauze and plaster bandages in art. This was a turning point in Segal's artistic expression. From then on, he began creating full-body plaster casts of his close friends, family, and colleagues. The artist kept the white of the cast, preferring in the early days the monochromatic hues. However, later he occasionally painted them in bright colors. While working with models, Segal discovered that he had to ""totally respect the entity of a specific human being, and it's a whole other set of insights, a whole other set of attitudes."" Throughout his career, he created numerous public installations, including the Abraham and Isaac (1978) at Princeton University's Modern Sculpture Garden and the Holocaust Memorial (1984) at California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. In 1980 the artist created the installation Gay Liberation in memory of the 1969 Stonewall riots and installed it at Christopher Street Park in Manhattan. In 1999 President Clinton presented the National Medal of Arts to George Segal. In 1997 he received the Praemium Imperiale from the Japan Art Association. In the last years of his life, the artist returned to painting and created numerous charcoal portraits of his family. The documentary about his life, titled film George Segal: American Still Life, was released in 2001. Unfortunately, the artist who passed away in 2000 never got to see it. ",2085

Barbara Schwartz,"Barbara Schwartz was an American Abstract artist. She experimented with wood, glass, and even produced pieces in bronze and aluminum. Born in Philadelphia, Schwartz received her B.F.A. from Carnegie Mellon University. After moving to New York, she had her first solo show at the Willard Gallery on East 72nd Street in Manhattan in 1975. Subsequently, she was represented by Hirschl & Adler Modern and then the Andre Zarre Gallery. Her work was presented at the 1979 Whitney Biennial. She had taught at the School of Visual Arts since 1978 until her death in 2006. Seeking to vitalize abstract painting, she made it more dimensional while linking it to non-Western decorative traditions. She drew on balanced organic and geometric forms as well as Islamic influences to revitalize the genre. Her abstract painted plaster reliefs were also loosely associated with the Pattern and Decoration art movement of the '70s and '80s. In the 1990s, she began introducing glazed ceramic into her work. Her work is in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the New York Public Library. ",2088
Valentin Carron,"The artistic strategy of Valentin Carron might look like to one as a just a random and harmless production of series of beautified objects, yet underneath it lies a strong and precise concept full of references spanning from popular culture to social and political upheavals. His oeuvre is embedded in the gestures, interventions, appropriation and sarcasm and the overall approach reminiscent of the 70’s conceptual art. Carron is constantly eager to problematize and re-define the status of an artwork in simulate relation to the both past and present.  Valentin Carron was born in Martigny in 1977. He attended the Cantonal School of Fine Arts (ECCO) in Sion from 1992 to 1999 and from 1997 to 2000, the Lausanne School of Fine Arts (ECAL). The growing success of a young artist was additionally confirmed by a large number of solo and group exhibitions and Overbeck Prize for Fine Art which he received in 2015. His works have become the part of several collections around the globe like Burger Collection in Hong Kong, The Rubell Family Collection in Miami, and Migros Museum in Zurich.   Carron is known for his sculptural works which are permeate with symbols, forms of archaeological discoveries, as well as sculptural works of well-known models such as Alberto Giacometti. The inserted references become a perfect tool for building his own appropriative pictorial and sign system. [1]Throughout the works, Carron is questioning the idea of national identity and tradition by a humorous use of vernacular and before mentioned method of appropriation. The motives which are often drawn from phenomenon’s like Pop Art and kitsch are in function of molding the mass-produced aesthetic with underlying social commentary.   Besides his works being commented and reviewed, Carron was seriously accused of plagiarism. Namely, it was stated that his work The Dawn presented at Fiac 2014 was a replica of a 1977 steel artwork by Francesco Marino di Teana, L’Aube (dawn in French), which is displayed in front of Neuchatel art and history museum. Certainly, this was just an act of Carron’s continuous appropriation method and several major curators and certain press stood behind his work. That is the usual gesture of referring to someone’s work by using almost the same form, yet deploying it in a completely different context which is a not a rare phenomenon in art history.[2]   In 2013 Valentin Carron was chosen to represent national pavilion at the prestigious 55th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale de Venezia. The artist managed to form strong formal language by introducing readymade aesthetic mixed with ideals of traditional Swiss Alpine imagery. In several attempts during their modern history, Swiss authorities fabricated traditional imagery and appointed it to certain parts of the country in order to gain larger tourism and straighten national identity. Therefore, by accentuating these details Carron is proposing a different discourse in regards to the matter of originality and fake of not only an artwork but rather of the national identity and capitalism. This participation enabled him to exhibit even more and positioned him as an aspiring and successful artist. Without any doubt, Carron governess his career in the sense of wisely thought concepts and ideas which are executed properly in regards to his agenda based on dematerialisation and re-contextualization of an artwork.

Isa Genzken,"Isa Genzken is a German sculptor and installation master with an extraordinary oeuvre which brought her the reputation of a tremendously important and influential female artist. For the past three decades, her work has been inspired by the severe modernist architecture and chaotic, whimsical urban energy. At the same time, Genzken's sources include the aesthetics of the sixties and pop culture. Genzken is continuously transforming her impressions of the modern world into her unique and eclectic three-dimensional pieces, which combine architecture, design, and even fashion. Even though her pieces might seem nonsensical at first, they contain a hidden yet cohesive inner harmony.  Isa Genzken was born and raised mostly in a small city in the northern Germany, called Bad Oldesloe. She studied fine arts and art history at the Hamburg University of Fine Arts and at the Berlin University of the Arts. Since the tuitions at these prestigious schools were quite expensive, Genzken was working as a part-time model in order to support her education. In 1973, she transferred to Arts Academy Dusseldorf and she decided to enroll at the University of Cologne as well, to study art history and philosophy. After she graduated in 1977, Genzken taught sculpture at the academy and around the same time she married an eminent German painter Gerhard Richter. Genzken was moving a couple of times because of her career - she has stayed in studios in Dusseldorf, Cologne, Berlin, Lowe Manhattan and Hoboken in Jew Jersey. It is known that Genzken suffered from bipolar disorder and she was undergoing treatments for substance abuse.   Genzken started to participate in various exhibitions back in the mid-1970s but she became really prolific after the mid-90s. In her pieces from this era, Genzken explored a new language in sculpture through her use of found objects and collage. Her use of assemblage techniques is notably innovative - in a way, Genzken was one of the pioneers of new-era assemblage. Her sculptures are so versatile in their shape and size that they range from very small pieces to huge installations that fill an entire room. One of her most famous pieces is the reproduction of the bust of Nefertiti, which was an ancient Egyptian icon of ideal beauty. In her series of sculptures inspired by Nefertiti, Genzken has appropriated plaster models of the female bust and decorated them with fashionable sunglasses. Another detail she added to this sculpture is the reproduction of the Renaissance beauty Mona Lisa, which Genzken used as a background for overlaying her own self-portrait. This interesting hybrid piece represents a playful exploration of the historical lineage of female beauty. When it comes to other Genzken’s works, they are quite complex assemblages of potted plants, furniture, and photographs. Unlike her her minimalist predecessors, Genzken refuses to create works that speak about order and power. Instead, she portrays much more delicate human qualities, such as vulnerability. The surfaces of her sculptures and collages are made from simple paper materials, such as many magazines, newspapers, flyers, or snapshots of her artworks.The shape of a column is one of the recurring motifs in her art - she adorns the purity of this simple shape with flower garlands and similar materials until the column reaches its maximum overload. In this way, Genzken explores the unusual relationships between art, designs, psychology and social experience. For example, her famous public sculpture Rose also represents kind of a fragile column. This piece is made from enamelled stainless steel and placed in Leipzig’s museum district.   In addition to her main work, Genzken also works in photography, video, and film. She has produced numerous movies such as Zwei Frauen im Gefecht in 1974, Chicago Drive in 1992, Meine Großeltern im Bayerischen Wald in 1992, and more recently the video Empire/Vampire, Who Kills Death, in 2003. When it comes to her exhibitions, it is interesting that she arranges her artworks so that they fill all the available surfaces in galleries and museums, including floors, ceilings, and pavements on the outside of the building. Her first solo exhibition in Europe was held in 1976 at the Konrad Fischer Gallery in Dusseldorf, while her first solo show in the U.S. took place at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York, in 1989. After these two debut solo shows, Genzken had numerous exhibitions in Italy, Germany, England, the Netherlands and the United States. Genzken continues to be a very active exhibitor - in 2016, she organised the exhibition Mach Dich Hübsch at the famous Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Her work is a part of many eminent international collections such as including MOMA in New York, Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh and Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.Isa Genzken has won the International Art Prize in 2004 and the Wolfgang-Hahn-Priz in 2002. In 2014, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City had introduced to the United States the entire oeuvre of Isa Genzken, which includes her versatile pieces made over a few decades. This marvelous retrospective was the first comprehensive view at Genzken’s work in all the media she used. The exhibit featured more than 150 artworks, such as three-dimensional pieces, paintings, photographs, collages, drawings, books, sculpture and even film. This exhibition felt like walking through an exciting story, beginning with Genzken’s early days and reaching the culmination with her mature, complex works.   Genzken's innovative work has strongly impacted the contemporary sculpture scene, because of her ability to use and combine unusual materials as plaster, concrete, steel, epoxy resin with household kitchen equipment. Because of this, her artistic style has broadened the definition of sculpture. The artist has always stayed true to her revolutionary ideas and whatever she creates remains contradictory, deliciously unpredictable, and even in opposition to our common sense. The artist is represented by David Zwirner 19th Street New York, David Zwirner 20th Street New York, and David Zwirner London.  ",2091

Sarah Lucas,"Coming to see an exhibition titled Penis Nailed to a Board, one would expect a rather strong sexual notion. Something provocative and certainly unorthodox. It was the name of the first solo show of Sarah Lucas, a member of an artistic phenomenon widely known as Young British Artists. Placing her work somewhere between the in-your-face feminist statement and materialism, she has forged her way from humble beginnings and is now one of the world’s best-known artists, and one worthy enough to be chosen to represent her country at the Venice Biennale. Employing visual puns and bawdy humor, she demonstrates the absurdity of cultural biases, trivial day-to-day life situations and instances from the male-dominated environment.  The artist heralded a new sensibility for the ‘90s, bringing along raw, angry aspect of British culture. Frustrated with the minimalist-influenced sculpture she made at Goldsmith’s College in the 1980s, Lucas turned to a cheaper, more immediate source of imagery: the tabloid press.[1] Inspired by feminist Andrea Dworkin and various books on sexuality and pornography, the artist deals with the male objectification of the female body and how women’s ‘sexual liberation’ has encouraged their inadvertent submissiveness. Through appropriating masculine tropes and gender constructions, she confronts and dissects them.  Instead of portraying the feminine as beauty, like Cindy Sherman before her, Lucas’s sculptures are fueled by the casual misogyny of everyday life, constructing visual puns to counter stereotypes of femininity.[2] And yet, contrary to the expectation that she always begins creating (especially in the earlier part of her career) with some sort of feminist statement, Lucas’s starting point is generally the materials: what she can get in a particular place and time – food, concrete blocks, stockings, human bodies. While perfectly aware of the feminist content, the aritst was always more interested in asking the questions than answering them. The materials Lucas uses (furniture, food, clothing) are sculptural and associative. Her sculptures are all headless. The only face seen in her work is her own, omnipresent through a sequence of self-portraits.   On March 21st, 2014, the British Council announced that Sarah Lucas will represent the United Kingdom at the 2015 Venice Biennale. Thus, she joined some of the country’s greatest artists, including Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Anish Kapoor, Gilbert & George, Tracey Emin, and many other deemed worthy of representing Great Britain in Venice. Andrea Rose, British Council Director of Visual Arts and Chair of the Venice Biennale Selection Committee, has said: “To prick convention could be a term coined for Lucas’ work. It’s impolite.""   Also, Gregor Muir, Executive Director at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, added: “Having consistently pushed the limits of her practice, there's a sense that Lucas - seemingly more active than ever - is coming into her own.""    Lucas grew up on a council estate in Holloway, north London. Her father was a milkman and her mother worked as a part-time gardener and cleaner. The artist remembers that her parents had little ambition to make a difference, and her mother even forbidding her to do homework because she was at school all day long anyway. Eventually, she left school when she was 16, and a year later, she was pregnant. Having realized that ""if I had a child now, I would be in this environment for the next 16 years and not going anywhere"", she had an abortion and went to Europe, hitchhiking and looking, fruitlessly, for an idea of what to do. [4]  Upon returning home, Sarah Lucas got a job (her mother, who was working at a play center, actually got it for her). There she met somebody who went to art college and the idea of being an artist was first born. Before graduating at Goldsmiths in 1987, she studied at Working Men's College, London and London College of Printmaking. Initially, the degree from Goldsmith didn’t mean much. Galleries only took boys at the time, and this first wave was quite impressive: Gary Hume, Angus Fairhurst, Mat Collishaw, and Damien Hirst. The situation changed after a couple of years, and Lucas began exhibiting her work in group shows. As mentioned above, her first solo exhibition (that put her on the map and made her famous) was titled Penis Nailed to a Board. It took place at City Racing in London. Today the artist's works are in public collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. In 2022 the artist had a solo exhibition Project 1: Sarah Lucas at National Gallery of Australia, and she participated in several group shows, including Obscura Luz (Obscure Light) at Galeria Luisa Strina in Sao Paulo and In The Company Of at Eden Eden in Berlin.   References:  ",2093
Shozo Shimamoto,"Shozo Shimamoto was a Japanese artist, a co-founder of Gutai group and one of the most daring and independent experimentalists of the postwar. Born in Osaka, Japan in 1928, Shozo Shimamoto attended Kansui Gakuin University and graduated in 1950. The artist is best-known for his contributions to the influential Gutai Art Group and the development of the mail art movement. Gutai was the first radical, post-war artistic group in Japan, created around the idea of a relationship between body and matter in pursuit of originality. The group was involved in large-scale multimedia environments, performances, and theatrical events.  As a founding member of the Gutai movement, Shimamoto’s action-based painting style was seen as the Eastern, independently born reaction to important art movements in the post-war art scene in the United States, most famous of them being Jackson Pollock’s Abstract Expressionism. Shimamoto's art is mainly ruled by the artist’s actions, gesture and chance. As an example of his work, Shozo Shimamoto's Bottle Crash performances consisted of the artist smashing glass bottles full of paint against a ground of canvas to create a pulsating field of color.  Shimamoto’s artworks are in a collection of several prominent art venues and museums, such as Tate Modern, London, Ca’ Pesaro International Gallery of Modern Art, Venice, National Museum of Modern Art of Rome and Art Center of Milan in Italy, Mail Art Museum, Switzerland, Paris Gallery in France, and Tokyo Contemporary Art Museum and Osaka Contemporary Art Museum in Japan.  The artist’s oeuvre has been featured in a number of important exhibitions dedicated to Gutai, including at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, MOCA – Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Jeu de Paume in Paris. In 1996, as a recognition of his important pacifist activities, Shimamoto was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Images copyright © the artist",2094
Park Seo-bo,"Regarded as a leader of Korean modernism, and a father figure of Korean contemporary art, Park Seo-bo is one of the founding members of the Dansaekhwa monochrome movement, which syntheses traditional Korean spirit and Western abstraction. Born in 1931 in the Yecheon County of North Gyeongsang, Chōsen, South Korea, Seo-bo insisted on pursuing art despite his father disapproval and entered Hongik University to study oriental painting under the lead of Yi Eungro. His studies were interrupted by the Korean War, after which he changed his major to western painting because his professors of oriental painting were all gone. He learned painting from scratch under the lead of Whanki Kim for 3 more years and graduated in 1955. In 1961, the artist received a UNESCO scholarship to study in Paris, where he became further acquainted with the principles of Art Informel, a movement that had great influence on the developments of Dansaekhwa. The Minimalist works of Seo-bo are characterized by process and discipline. Conflating the ethos of traditional Korean culture with the formal language of linear abstraction, his paintings are mainly based on nature, reducing the idea and emotion ""to create pure emptiness."" In his practice that is both violent and meditative, he uses a range of techniques, from sewing hemp onto canvas stretched over junkyard metal, and burning and corroding the surface of his works with blowtorches and chemicals.

He is also known for his sculptures. Born 1944 in Bern, Mosset lives and works in Tucson, Arizona. As a young artist he was an assistant to both Jean Tinguely and Daniel Spoerri. While living in Paris int he 1960s, he was a member of the collective BMPT, along with Daniel Buren, Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni. The group questioned notions of authorship and originality. They often did each other's works, implying that the art object was more important than its authorship. His work has been exhibited in venues all around the world, including Musée de Beaux-Arts La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Centre d’Art Contemporain, France, Musée Sainte-Croix, France, Centre d’Art Contemporain, Geneva, Musée Saint Pierre Art Contemporain, Lyon, Musée Cantonal des Beaux-Arts de Lausanne, Switzerland, Palais de Tokyo, Paris, Museo d’Arte di Mendrisio, Switzerland, Musée d'art contemporain de Lyon, France, Kunsthalle Zürich, Switzerland, Opéra national de Paris, Palais Garnier, Paris, and Musée Régional d'Art Contemporain Languedoc-Roussilon à Sérignan, France. Mosset is best known for a series of monochrome paintings, each featuring a black circle. Between 1966 and 1974, he produced around 200 of these works, seeking to challenge established methods of art-making and theorize a new social and political function for art and artists.",2098

Lee Bontecou,"Lee Bontecou is an American artist best known for her abstract wall works that feature reliefs, hanging sculptures and miniatures. These large-scale, dark-toned pieces usually contain ominous, organic voids at their centers and are made from patching together accumulations of shaped canvases, leather, porcelain curios, wire mesh, conveyer belts and muslin recall nests. When completed, they appear as unnatural mixtures of machines, ancient architecture and the human body. By working in that fashion, Bontecou aims to, as she explained herself, capture as much of life as possible—no barriers—no boundaries—all freedom in every sense[1]. It should also be noted that Lee creates mystical drawings that allow her to further her investigation of natural and man-made forms.  Lee Bontecou attended the prestigious Bradford Junior College (now known just as the Bradford College) in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and the Art Students League of New York from 1952 to 1955, where she spent a lot of time studying with the sculptor William Zorach. She learned to weld at the Skowhegan School for Painting and Sculpture in Maine where Lee stayed for the entire summer of 1954. In her early artistic expressions, the horrors of the World War II played a major part. Both of Bontecou's parents joined the war effort, so Lee spent a lot of time at her grandmother in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, thinking about the fate of her mother and father. Here, she developed a love of the natural world that remained a big part of her creative expression to this day. Bontecou is best known for the sculptures she created in the 1960s, pieces which challenged artistic conventions of both materials and presentation, offering a unique compromise between sculpted and pictorial artwork.[2] A major occurrence that truly directed her career as an artist was her discovery of the way in which a torch for welding could produce an easily-controlled spray of the black soot that became a signature material in her work. Lee's 1960s work was made from recycled canvas and industrial materials such as conveyor belts, as well as many found objects that referenced the early avant-garde and Dada.   Starting with the year of 1971, Lee began teaching at the Brooklyn College on a regular basis - she worked here until the year of 1991. Bontecou moved to Orbisonia, Pennsylvania full-time in 1988 where she continues to work to this day. She maintained a vigorous studio practice, but showed infrequently and obviously decided to take a step back from her public activities. She was brought back to the public attention during the 2003 retrospective co-organized by the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. This show eventually traveled to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2004[3]. Lee Bontecou retrospective included both work from her public, art-world career and an extensive display of work done after retreating from the public view.   Nowadays, Lee Bontecou and her work are rightfully treated as a valid milestone in art history. Not only are her abstract pieces as original and unique as any modern artwork can be, but their author is also widely recognized as one of the most important female artists of the 1960s. Lee is also held in high regard due to her connections with feminism, although her work always did aim to be a part of a much more challenging creative topic - exploring the very materiality as a conceptual gesture within art. By choosing to challenge this kind of concept, Lee wound up with a practice that is broadly accepted as one of the greatest artistic tensions between the industrial and the organic the world has ever seen.

Leonetto Cappiello,"French Italian artist Leonetto Cappiello is considered the father of modern advertising poster design. He revolutionized the design and brought new ideas that successfully captured the attention of passersby. Without previous training, when France was dominated by the Art Nouveau style and works by Alphonse Mucha, Jules Cheret, and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Cappiello refused to follow the trends. Instead of intricate designs, the artist decided to put his colorful subject against a simple black background, which created a bold contrast. Today Cappiello's works are part of several international collections, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, and  The Museum of Modern Art in New York.   Cappiello (born in 1875 Tuscany) moved to Paris in 1898 and, without formal training, began working for renowned magazines of the time as an illustrator. Many of his caricatures were published in such magazines as Le Sourire, Le Rire, La Baionnette and L’Assiette au Beurre. In his early works, the influence of the Toulouse-Lautrec style is quite apparent. In 1902 for the L'Assiette au Beurre magazine, the artist published a book of his caricatures titled Gens du Monde and a year later Le Théâtre de Cappiello for the Le Théâtre magazine. Even though he enjoyed a successful career as a caricature artist, Cappiello slowly began leaning toward poster design. In 1900 the artist began working for the printer Pierre Vercasson who was looking for something new that would put him above the competition. When Vercasson saw Cappiello's poster for the magazine Frou-Frou, he knew he had found the right designer. For the next ten years, the artist created over 100 posters that changed the way poster design was viewed.   Leonetto Cappiello was a non-conformist, refusing to bow down to the requirements of the Art Nouveau style that ruled the French poster scene. A true innovator, he quickly realized that the best way to achieve the desired effect was to create a popping design that immediately caught the audience's attention. For this reason, he rejected the intricate details of Art Nouveau posters in favor of a more simplistic and effective design. The bold subjects, such as mythological creatures, Comedia del Arte characters, and dancers, the artist drew in a bright palette against a dark background, thus creating a shock effect. The revolutionary poster design proved to be the most effective in drawing attention and building a brand.   Some of the most recognizable works by Cappiello are the French wine ad titled Maurin Quina (1906), lespirates (1910), Italian vermouth ad, and Thermogène (1909) ad for a cough and rheumatism remedy. The artist has, throughout his career, created over 500 advertisement posters. After World War I, he began working for the Devambez, a Parisian publisher, who for the next several decades found clients for the artist from all over Europe, which helped the artist gain international recognition. Leonetto Cappiello passed away in 1942 in Cannes. Featured image: Leonetto Cappiello - Le Frou Frou (detail), 1899. Captions, via Creative Commons ",2103

Scott Scheidly,"Scott Schiedly is an American painter, born in Ohio. He graduated from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh in 1990 and moved to Florida. His work is in the style of pop-surrealism. It features realistic interpretations of the surreal, fused with pop culture references.  The artist has a large fan base, due to his humorous artworks which explore the culture implications of colors. His paintings feature realistic portraits of historically infamous, hyper-masculinized world leaders and public figures, such as Kim Jong III, Hitler, Heinrch Himmler, Ayatollah Khomeini and Pope.   He uses a color palette of lilacs, pinks and magentas to explore the cultural connotations linked to color, question power and those who wield it, as well as the notion of masculinity. If it weren't for the pink frames of these paintings, one could easily confuse his works with the art of Classical portrait painters, since Scott Schiedly's works are not just provocative and satirical. They are technically well-rendered, bearing the resemblance to traditional masters of painting.  In 2011, his Pink portrait series debuted at Spoke Art pop up exhibition in New York City. In 2012, they have been featured at the Scope Art Fair during Art Basel Miami Beach, in addition to ArtPadSF fine art fair in San Francisco in 2011 and 2012.  All images copyright © the artist",2107
Alexandre Da Cunha,"In everyday life, we’re surrounded by a lot of things, whose true purpose is hiding in plain sight, often escaping our attention. Alexandre da Cunha is a Brazilian artist who refers to his artistic practice as pointing rather than making. He’s pointing at objects that already exist and highlights and reveals new and sometimes unexpected meanings. Continual exploitation of an object by twisting its meaning is the core of his process. The artist is also known for his exploration of the hybrid and complicated national identity. The potential of his objects is emphasized by pointing out their specific aspects. The humorous element is present, but hidden on the first look, and the accent is the perfect timing to tell a joke because otherwise something intended to be funny becomes dull and not entertaining.  The artist mostly works in installations, sculptures, and assemblages, but painting as well, where his pieces are often made of mass-produced consumer products or materials used in industry, like foam or concrete. Da Cunha’s attention is equally distributed between the formal properties of these objects – shape, color, and texture, and their social, historical, and cultural resonances. His work is influenced by the architecture of European Modernists, Op Art, and of course, the great Marcel Duchamp. The artist acknowledges Duchamp’s influence and states that his ideas are so universal in contemporary art that almost all artists are influenced by a Master at some point of their artistic careers.   Da Cunha was born in Brazil but he’s been living in London for more than a decade. He studied at the Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado in São Paulo, Brazil, Royal College of Art in London, and the Chelsea College of Art, also in the capital of England. His work revolves around reclaiming, decontextualization and altering the objects, and in doing so, they slowly begin to lean towards the sensibilities of other objects. When speaking about mimicry, so ever-present in his pieces, there are two things at work – on one side, the specific periods in art history are referenced by all the works, playing the joke, like when deck chair references minimalist painting – the other side is the artist’s actual interest in the origins of the materials, like the flags and the beach towels they’re made of.   Da Cunha’s practice could be described as a satire of the modern art. The element of humor is extremely important, and the artist deeply enjoys in the fact that his pieces look very formal and rigid at the first sight. But, once more time is given to studying the artworks, the viewers notice there are hidden sides, often hysterical, that reveal themselves. For him, the most important things are to be precise when it comes to the timing of his jokes, since the objects trying very hard to be funny, often are not funny at all, but also to discover how to find and how to get the joke right.

Diego Rivera,"Diego Rivera was a notable Mexican artist, known for large murals and frescos, in which he proudly portrayed sceneries from Mexican culture and political and social prospects. His subjects cover the range from classical to visionary where the political note of his murals transcends the aesthetical impression. The murals reveal the incredible drive and vigor that moved Rivera and motivated him to passionately pursue his aspirations. Even in commissioned work, he couldn't resist but to honestly speak up about his beliefs and opinions. He openly propagated communism and socialism and believed in revolutionary character of art. In 2011 a major retrospective of his work was held at MOMA, New York, the previous one being in 1931. His ideological art, still relevant in present times, made him the leader of Mexican Muralist movement. Rivera's artwork reflects on capitalism and consumerism, mass production that swallows the rights of a common worker.  The interest for his political engagement and movement striking art was revived at the beginning of 21st century,  because of the global interest for his love life, the love story of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo.  Rivera was born in 1886 in Guanajuato, Mexico to a Judaist family that had to convert to Catholicism. For all his life Diego was an atheist, but he always felt a great injustice for his family conversion. He had a twin brother who died when they were two years old, and just a year after his brother's unfortunate death, Rivera started drawing. His first artwork was done on the walls of his home, but the walls were soon replaced with chalkboards that his parents installed throughout the whole house. When he was ten years old he started studying at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. His extraordinary talent and ambition were awarded a scholarship to study in Europe. He went to Spain in 1907 but decided to move to Paris instead. Years in Paris determined the rest of his career, influenced his style, and gave him the opportunity to befriend some of the most prominent artists at the time. Few of them stayed in his close circle, like Amedeo Modigliani and his wife, writer Ilya Ehrenburg whose poems he often used in paintings and lithographs (ie Figura), painter Moïse Kisling and many others. At the time, the cubism started to expand in the art circles of Paris, and Rivera embraced the new style, moved by the paintings of Picasso and Braque. Aside from the cubism, he wanted to individualize his style and the paintings of Post-Impressionism movement got him to simplify his form and to encompass the beautiful vivid colors. He had a turbulent love life, many affairs, lovers, and wives. From the first marriage to Angelina Beloff he had a son, Diego (born in 1916, tragically passed away in 1918), and he had a daughter with Maria Vorobieff-Stebelska, named Marika (born in 1918). He was married to his second wife Guadalupe Marín, when he met Frida Kahlo. With his second wife, he had two daughters, Ruth, and Guadalupe. Frida Kahlo was still a student when she met Diego, and the couple married in 1929 when she was 22 and Rivera was 42. Twenty years of age difference, individually independent spirit spiced up with the heavy urge to create and flourish artistically, many fights and arguments caused by his flirtatious spirit and hot-boiled temper, made them one of the most famous and exciting art couples of the 20th century.   Rivera's style went through few transformations before he established himself as a muralist. The Mexican revolution in 1914 influenced his perception of art and its role in society. Simultaneously with the revolution in Mexico, he grew away from the cubism and post-impressionism and decided to never again be a part or even a sympathizer of the closed artistic circles that kept the art away from the public. He went on a road of discovery and by leaving France for Italy, he found what he was looking for in Rennesiance frescos. Frescos were the perfect medium for his idea to paint the socially important subject, open to a wide range of viewers, giving the audience a historical lesson packed up in the beautiful imagery. The complexity of the social changes he witnessed demanded a large canvas, so painting frescos and murals gave him freedom and space to portray all the important elements of the story he wanted to share. When he returned home to Mexico, Rivera was commissioned to paint several murals on the walls of public and governmental buildings, like the National Palace, Palace of Fine Arts and many others. He participated in the everyday political life of the governmental system, witnessed the change in the regime and new laws, all of which gave him the status of an important public figure. He painted scenes from the revolutionary protests, demonstrations, many scenes from the traditional Mexican folk culture, all mixed up in an anthropological and social depiction of the society. Day of the Dead elements were mixed with left-wing politics and egalitarianism symbols, producing an incredible allegorical scrutiny of the regime and the position of the modern man at the time. Although he was commissioned to paint by the Mexican government he didn't hesitate to openly scrutinize the authority and to state out his political preferences, in which he strongly criticized capitalism. His murals often included elements of Mexican, Indian and Aztec culture, flowers and skulls, beautiful sun soaked nature and landscapes.   The History of Mexico is one of the most famous murals Diego Rivera painted. It is located above the stairs in the National Palace in Mexico City, and it took the artist six years to complete it. He started painting the mural in 1929 and finished work in 1935. The subject of the mural is the history of Mexico shown in four sections, each one portraying the journey and struggle of a common Mexican man, fighting for independence and freedom against the Spanish and French occupation. Diego Rivera was hired by the Mexican government to paint Mexican past in a positive manner, to emphasize the greatness and bravery of the revolutionaries. The first part of the mural located on the north wall shows the traditional elements of Aztec folklore, painted around the big sun, which symbolized the center of the universe, the essence of being. There are many motifs of the traditional everyday Aztec culture, volcanoes, pyramids, temples, cornfields, workers, parents, craftsmen and artist. He included religious elements, worship of holy animals - snake and jaguar. The central part of the mural is located on the west wall and it shows the political fight against the oppression and dictatorship. This piece shows more drastic sceneries, the fight against religious conversions, hatred, poverty, and violence. Thier mission was to fight for freedom, against the Spanish dictator Porfirio Diaz. In the center of the mural is an eagle that symbolizes the Aztec religion, and a new era of Mexican history. The third part of the mural is located on the east and west sides of the main wall, depicting historical figures of Mexico. The last section, the fourth one, Rivera made under his vision of the future of the country. He saw Mexico under the socialist regime and under the Soviet flag. He painted his wife Frida Kahlo with her sister as the protagonists of a new regime, along with Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto and schools for new generations that will live prosper and never witness violence again.   The most controversial mural that Rivera ever produced was a later destroyed piece made for Nelson Rockefeller, entitled Man at Crossroad. He hired Rivera to paint a large mural for the new Rockefeller Center in New York. He wanted a modern mural and gave Rivera a topic - men looking for a better future, in a hopeful manner choosing the right path at the metaphorical crossroad of life. He chose to portray two ideologies - communism and capitalism placed right and left of the central part, in which men were depicted working on the machines. From the center, four propellers are rising to the corners of the mural, symbolizing the crossroad of life. There are images of scientific research, chemical reactions, telescopes, atoms with dividing cells. The controversial parts were not visions of future, but the obvious preference of the communist regime. Vladimir Lenin was depicted standing among the racially diverse group of people, uniting them by joining hands, while John D. Rockefeller Jr. was portrayed being surrounded by many women, drinking and smoking, expressing the vile character of capitalism even more stressed out with the scenes of police brutality and soldiers carrying weapons. For Rivera communism represented the preservation of natural goods, of peace and equal rights, while capitalism moved away from the equality and justice. The mural was never completely finished, Nelson Rockefeller ordered its destruction, but Rivera had photographs of the mural, so he recreated it under the name Man, Controller of the Universe at the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City.   After the Rockefeller unfinished mural, Diego Rivera moved back to Mexico, taking some good memories of the time in the USA, as he painted murals for the Detroit Industry in 1932 and 1933, showing the modern Americal industrial workers. He liked this theme and believed in industrial revolution, so he depicted American men with sympathy. Time in the USA did him well, as he felt great pressure from the right wing movement back home. He also painted murals for the California School of Fine Arts and San Francisco Pacific Stock Exchange. The major point in his career was the exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, held in 1931. The Rockefeller incident lost him sympathies and appreciation of New York public, so he moved back to Mexico. His personality, which was often described as high-tempered, was not the main issue in his communication, it was his ideological work that was not approved. In the 1940's he was at a peak of his artistic career and political activism, which partly took its toll on his personal life when he and Frida divorced, but a later reunited. Kahlo and Rivera offered asylum to the Soviet politician, Leon Trotsky, leader of the Red Army and Marxist revolutionary. Rivera never stopped believing in social justice and strongly opposed any form of authority. He created murals, frescos and paintings for over fifty years. He was fascinated by the natural wealth of Mexican land, by traditional food and drinks, by beautiful women, science, and art. ",2110
Julio Larraz,"A Cuban-born painter, sculptor, printmaker, and caricaturist, Julio César Ernesto Fernandez Larraz is known for his mastery of realism.

Egon Schiele,"Egon Schiele, an Austrian expressionist painter, is known for his bizarre yet innovative ways of depicting erotic atmosphere and deeply psychological self-portraits. Schiele used colors rather sparingly, making his work identifiable by his typical black outlines and limited palette. In his numerous self-portraits done over many years, the artist is usually nude and staring directly into the viewer, making the relationship between the artist and his viewers dynamic, tense, and confrontational . Schiele’s female models were also nude, with their bodies depicted in bizarre, contorted positions. The artist was a student of the symbolist Klimt, but only a small portion of Schiele’s works, such as his landscapes, evoke the folkloric atmosphere present in Klimt’s paintings.[1] Even though Schiele was a prolific painter, his splendid career ended tragically, since he died in 1918 when he was 28, as a victim of the Spanish flu. [caption id=""attachment_301145"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Egon Schiele - Reclining Nude, 1910[/caption]  Egon Schiele was born in a small Austrian town also known as Blumenstadt or a city of flowers. His father, Adolf Schiele, was a stationmaster at the Austrian State Railways. His mother, Marie Soukupova, was originally from the Bohemian town called Krumau, which is now the site of the Egon Schiele museum. Talking about the artist’s family history, Schiele had two sisters, Melanie and Gertrude, the latter of whom married one of Schiele's friends. During his childhood, Schiele was considered a strange person – he was always shy, introverted and bad at school. He excelled only in athletics and drawing and attended classes with younger generations of students. Schiele had incestuous fantasies towards his younger sister Gertrude, which eventually came true - when he was sixteen,he took his twelve-year-old sister Gerti on a train trip to Trieste without parents’ permission. Upon arriving in Italy, they spent a night together in a hotel room. Despite his problematic behavior and poor grades at school, one of Schiele’s art instructors recognized a natural gift for drawing and painting in him. This teacher also supported him and encouraged him to pursue formal, academic training in visual arts. After his father had died from syphilis, young Egon was been placed under the guardianship of his uncle Leopold and couple of years later, in 1906, he enrolled in Akademie der Bildenden Kunste in Vienne, the same school that Gustav Klimt attended.  [caption id=""attachment_301148"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""835""] Egon Schiele - Walburga Neuzil in Black Stockings, 1913[/caption]  Painter Gustav Klimt had a huge influence on Schiele's artistic path. He also became Schiele's close friend and mentor. Schiele inherited Klimt's focus on eroticism and they also had an insatiable sexual appetite in common. However, the emotionally intense atmosphere typical for Schiele’s work is something he developed on his own – Klimt’s pieces are, on the other hand, more peaceful and more idyllic. Eventually, Schiele’s exploration of his own inner world and turbulent emotional states started to opposed Klimt’s Art Nouveau style. Klimt was fond of rich, brilliant palette and shiny surfaces, while Schiele preferred austere, raw simplicity.[2] Yet, Klimt was very influential in Schiele’s life also as a connection to various patrons, models, and other artists that Schiele knew little about, despite being an utterly devoted art student. The artist didn’t have many occasions to learn about the culture outside of Vienna, because the capital of Austria was somewhat isolated from European avant-garde circles in the 1910s. Thanks to Klimt, Schiele was introduced to the Wiener Werkstatte, the arts and crafts workshops belonging to the Vienna Secession. The Wiener Werkstatte was considered an innovative movement closely tied to other modernist art styles. In 1908, when Schiele was still a teenager, he took part in his first group exhibition in a small town north of Vienna. In 1909, with a group of art students, Schiele decided to leave the Academy in protest because he deemed their teaching methods too conservative. He also thought that the Academy failed to accommodate properly more forward-thinking artists which were becoming more and more prominent throughout Europe. Schiele founded  the Neuekunstgruppe , also known as New Art Group, as a part of his artistic rebellion. This New Art Group consisted of numerous dissatisfied artists who decided to flee their educational path at the Academy. The members of the group were very prolific – they were continuously organizing public exhibitions throughout Vienna and its neighborhoods. Even though Schiele was an active participant in their projects, he was also exploring new painting styles for himself. He introduced unusual distortions, jagged contours, and somewhat somber, dark palette. In this way, he distanced himself from the decorative Art Nouveau style. To put it simply, Schiele was gradually growing apart from the style he once admired, the style typical for Klimt. In spite of this, the two of them remained very close friends until Klimt's early death in 1918.   Schiele’s portraits and self-portraits which explore people’s psyches and sexuality are among the most remarkable and most refreshing visual expressions of the twentieth century. It is also important to mention that the artist, who was extremely prolific during his career, is famous not only for his erotically charged artworks but also for his unusual, mysterious biography.[3] His lifestyle was both scandalous and tragic – he died when he was only twenty-eight, three days after his pregnant wife died, at a time he was about to achieve a significant commercial success which eluded him during his early career. The artist’s bold portraits and self-portraits managed to reestablish both subgenres of painting because of their unparalleled emotional and sexual rawness and directness. Also, the use of figural distortion was a novel practice which changed the typical visions of beauty. Schiele was prevalently depicting himself or his friends and acquaintances, using a plenty of awkwardly revealing and unsettling angles, such as views from above, which were uncommon in the portrait genre at the time. Occasionally, he would incorporate traditional motifs as well, in order to create a powerful allegorical statement on the human condition. Schiele possessed enviable, extraordinary drawing skills and he left behind around three thousand magnificent drawings. He regarded drawing as his main expression and he appreciated it the most, because of its immediacy and simplicity. His works count as some of the finest examples of drawing in the history of this medium. When it comes to his paintings, they preserved some of his drawings’ crucial characteristics, such as contours and linearity.   After forming the New Art aka Neuekunstgruppe, Schiele has achieved a modest success as a painter, which lead to his first solo exhibition in 1911. The show was held at Galerie Miethke in Vienna and it consisted of the artist’s psychoanalytical self-portraiture and sexualized portraits of young women. After his debut solo show, Schiele started participating in numerous group exhibitions - in Prague in 1910, in Budapest in 1912, then at the Sonderbund in Cologne in 1912. He also took part in several Secessionist shows in Munich. In 1913, Galerie Hans Goltz in Munich held another Schiele’s solo exhibit and the same happened in Paris in 1914. Schiele's early painting studies were very controversial because he used even children as his nude models. While the artist was living with his mother in Southern Bohemia, his practice of inviting young children to his studio was strongly disapproved by the local people. Despite such issues, Schiele was growing more and more popular and he had the chance to showcase his works together with the Der Blaue Reiter circle of expressionists. Schiele's most popular artwork at the time was his iconic Self-Portrait with Chinese Lantern Plant from 1912, which is a unique study of the artist himself, focusing on his face and its imperfections, such as lines, scars, and even small deformities. The Goltz show from 1912 provided a great public exposure to Schiele  because it emphasized the artist’s use of personal symbolism and dark allegories. During the same controversial year of 1912, while living in Neulengbach in Austria, Schiele was arrested and imprisoned for more than twenty days because he was accused of raping an underage girl.[4] Even though these serious charges were eventually dropped, he still had to pay a certain fine for creating pornographic drawings of his young girlfriend, Wally Neuzil. Because of these incidents, Schiele gradually stopped using children as his models, even though his work, particularly his drawings, remained sexually explicit.   Even after the World War I started, Schiele's prolific artistic output remained the same. In 1914, he had another important solo exhibition at Galerie Guido Arnot in Vienna, along with numerous shows in other Austrian cities. In 1915, Egon Schiele has left his girlfriend Wally Neuzil to marry Edith Harms, who was a young woman of very good social reputation. Thanks to this woman Schiele's work became more mature, as seen in his pieces such as Lovers from 1914 and Death and the Maiden from1915. These artworks, unlike his nudes, have more prominent narrative structures, similarly to traditional portraiture. Schiele was assigned to serve military just four days after his marriage, but he never participated in any real combats during the war, as he was allowed to practice his art and organize exhibitions anytime he wanted. Yet, the war has influenced his art because he was inspired by his frequent travels. Schiele created a large number of landscapes and cityscapes during the war and the style of these works was slightly different from his typical portraiture. Schiele’s landscapes are devoid of strong and dark contours, yet they are very detailed and still decisively expressionist. In 1917, Schiele was back in Vienna, where he continued working hard. He also co-founded the city's Kunsthalle aka Art Hall, which was a new exhibition space designed specifically for aspiring Austrian artists. Next year, 1918, was the time of both great success and deep tragedy for Schiele. His mentor Klimt has died from pneumonia but a month after his death the Vienna Secession devoted its main exhibition space to Schiele, who achieved his first serious commercial success. Then in October of 1918, his pregnant wife has suddenly succumbed to the Spanish flu and died. The same grim fate took Schiele's life just a few days later and he died when he was just 28. During the last three days of his life, he was drawing sketches of his late wife.   Despite his short and tragic life, the artist has created a staggering number of both canvas and paper based works. Egon Schiele was the crucial figure in the foundation of the early twentieth-century expressionism - his irregular contours, somber palette, and dark symbolism inspired other fledgling expressionists. Unlike his mentor Klimt, Schiele has produced many self-portraits which suggest his preoccupation with the self, similarly to Picasso. Schiele's unique aesthetic influenced his contemporaries such as Oskar Kokoschka, but also his neo-expressionist successors such as Francis Bacon and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Egon Schiele’s iconic Kneeling Nude with Raised Hands from 1910 is still considerably the most important nude piece of the 20th century. The artist’s radical yet disturbing approach towards the naked human theme has been challenging even for the most prominent art scholars and painters. His unconventional approach was against the strict policies of the early 20th-century academia - his contorted lines and different kind of figurative expression managed to evoke a new kind of sensuality in visual arts. To sum up, Egon Schiele has excelled in the skill of capturing sexually charged scenes and expressing emotional revolutions.   Egon Schiele is certainly one of the most important portraitists of the early twentieth century. His artworks are influential not only in his native Austria and throughout Europe, but also around the world. As a central figure of Austrian expressionism, Schiele has spent most of his short life in Vienna and the cultural and artistic currents of this region can be analyzed through his art. His works are also documenting the emergence of expressionism since he was an early representative of this style. Throughout his unusual and dramatic career, Schiele tested the boundaries of typical portraiture. His portraits and self-portraits, which are openly erotic and devoid of any scenery, represent artworks of priceless originality and they also exude deep empathy with the universal issue of the human condition. Egon Schiele lived and worked in Vienna, Austria. References:  ",2113

Adam Lister,"Adam Lister is an American artist, born in 1978, in Fairfax, Virginia. He is known for exploring pop culture and art history through creating pixelated images of famous paintings, inspired by his love for the 8-bit graphics of the Atari and Nintendo game consoles.  Lister went to School of Visual Arts in New York, and obtained his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2003. Since then, he has exhibited his works in numerous exhibitions throughout the United States, but also in the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Adam's biggest supporter is his family – his wife and son, who inspire him to work hard.  Adam Lister combines the deconstructed and minimal aesthetic of old-school video games with famous artworks, such as the Mona Lisa and pop-culture characters, such as Batman or the Simpsons.  His engaging visual compositions are inspired by the 8-bit games he used to play in his childhood. Using the principle of pixelated images as a guideline, he juxtaposes Cubism with the school pastime, in order to break down, rearrange and reference iconic images. Lister explores the connection between past and contemporary modes of representations, thus creating paintings and prints that possess both the hard edge geometry of old-school video games and the softness of watercolor paintings.  His works provoke the sense of bittersweet nostalgia, as our favorite childhood characters, the artworks we learned about in school and video games are all fused together. Adam Lister also produces textured sandstone sculptures of the same images, with the help of 3-d printers and the painter and designer Isaac Budmen.    Lister's images are either taken from the pages of a comic book, the walls of the Louvre, or a Holywood blockbuster poster. In his works you can see both the worlds of Star Wars characters, Alice in Wonderland, Iron Man or Harry Potter, and the renowned art pieces such as Dali's The Persistence of Memory, Munch's Scream or Van Gogh's self-portrait.     Lister begins his work with a recognizable image, such as Wonder Woman or Gustav Klimt's The Kiss, and then turns it into a bunch of angles, by drawing with a pencil and building the initial sketch into a completely angular and geometric representation of the subject. He uses only vertical and horizontal lines, so that a circle becomes a square, and a diagonal turns into a staircase.  Sometimes, there are images which just cannot be translated as well as others and require a lot of work. Although pixelated and lacking details, the familiar images are still very recognizable. The flatness of watercolor is perfectly fused with digital aesthetic.    Lister has been exhibiting his works since 2003, mostly in his home country. The long list of venues where the visitors could see his nostalgia-evoking and heart-warming paintings include Joseph Gross Gallery in New York, USA; Catalyst Gallery, Beacon, NY; Kunstlerhaus Dosenfabrik in Hamburg, Germany; The Gallery On The Corner in London, UK; Dalet Gallery, Philadelphia PA and Shooting Gallery in San Francisco, USA. One of his latest solo shows Wet Geometry was held at Shooting Gallery in San Francisco, CA in 2014. He is represented by Vertical Gallery in Chicago, Illinois. In March 2015 his work was included in group show Heroes & Villains  at the gallery located in Chicago.",2118

This artist first exposed his art while working at the Leonard Street Gallery. Many street artists he met there encouraged him to put his work out on the street, among them were Sweet Toof and Cyclops. And so he did.  Bortusk was stenciling pigeons on newspaper or cardboard, stocking them up. Then came the monsters - created when Bortusk tried to copy his early childhood drawings. So, Leer became known as a hardcore paste-up artist in Shoreditch. His monster creatures, spray-painted on newspapers brought vivid colors experience to London streets carrying a large dose of humor and joy. Because exactly that, and nothing else, is Leer’s goal – to make people laugh.  Next successful thing was a kids TV series featuring his monsters and so monsters became huge and their creator notorious for them. Those vivid colors he uses came from the inspiration he got on his trip to India. He simply wanted to bring back the psychedelic experience into western culture.  Among artists he admires is Picasso and the members of the CoBrA Movement, together with one of its founders Karel Appel - the Dutch painter. Bortusk had many exhibitions in UK, Italy and Netrherlands. His colorful work can be found in US, Germany, Spain and Australia.  All images copyright © the artist",2120
Gonzalo Fuenmayor,"Gonzalo Fuenmayor is a Colombian artist, known for using bananas as a symbol for cultural relation. He was born in 1977 in Barranquilla, Colombia.  Gonzalo Fuenmayor received his Bachelor of Fine Art from School of Visual Arts, New York, NY, in 2000, with Major in Fine Art and Minor in Art Education, and his Masters in Fine Art from School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2004, from which he also earned the prestigious Traveling Fellowship. Leticia, Colombian city in the heart of the Amazon was chosen as a destination. Its enticement and excitement is going to be perfect for Fuenmayor to continue to examine the notions of the exotic and collision of cultures.  Fuenmayor expresses himself in several ways, he draws, he paints and he is taking photographs. His mastery of charcoal drawing technique extents to the point where it’s almost impossible to differentiate black and white photographs from his work. What has marked Fuenmayor’s carrier are bananas. The idea came from wanting to make himself and his work more exotic, while he was in Boston. Since then, this fruit has found its place in many of his artworks. He maybe is famous for the use of bananas, but what really catches the eye is the conflict between his Latino roots and the Europe heritage he has been exposed to. Fuenmayor excels in portraying the clash of cultures, creating magical realism.  He is represented by Dolby Chadwick Gallery in San Francisco, USA.  All images courtesy of the artist.",2121
Pino Pinelli,"Pino Pinelli is an Italian artist, known for his minimalistic, large-scale pieces which challenge and alters the traditional idea of painting. Pino Pinelli was in 1938 born in Catania, Sicily. In the 1960s, the artist moved to Milan, attracted by the great artistic and cultural turmoil that occurred at that time around essential figures of Italian post-war art such as Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni and Enrico Castellani. Inspired by these slightly older Zero artists, Pinelli created artworks that capture and embody the desire of the era to change the existence of traditional painting.   Experimenting with new solutions that he could use for the surface of paintings, Pino explored geometry, shape and color, and at the same time analyzed the relationship between the artist and the artwork. Body of art that emerged from these experiments were his large-scale mixed media geometric forms made from predominantly primary colors. In such way, Pinelli managed to eliminate the presence of the canvas in its usual form.  Pino Pinelli’s first exhibition took place in 1968 at Galleria Bergamini in Milan. Since then, his work has been exhibited in numerous group and solo shows, not only in Italy, but also internationally in France at Galerie Lil’Orsay and Galerie Chantal Crousel-Svennung in Paris, and in Germany at Galerie Neuendorf in Frankfurt. Other important exhibitions include the ones held at the Institute of Italian Culture in London, the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome, and the participation at the Venice Biennale in 1987 and 1997.

Andrea Wan,"Andrea Wan is a Hong Kong-born illustrator and visual artist, known for the dream-like illustrations created in her unique surrealist style. Raised in Vancouver, and now based in Berlin, Andrea brings to the table some of the most amazing artworks, articulated through her signature visual language, and backed up by the cultural diversity within her. Apart from illustrations, she has also created several murals in Hawaii and Geneva, Switzerland.  Andrea was born in 1985 in Hong Kong, and then moved to Vancouver, Canada with her parents when she was ten years old. Seeing that the parents were graphic designers, it comes as no surprise that Andrea was interested in art, and encouraged to pursue a career in it from an early age. She started her academic training at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, from which she graduated, obtaining a degree in Film, Video and Integrated Media. She later went to Denmark to continue with her education at Designskolen Kolding, where she studied Design and Illustration. While living and learning in Europe, Andrea began to explore and broaden her style, developing her artistic expression. In 2012, she moved to Berlin, Germany, where she lives to this day. The constant change of scenery and cultures in her life will prove to be an invaluable, never-ending source of inspiration to the artist.    The art of Wan serves as a sort of the artist’s personal diary. Through an emotional landscape, people, animals and ghosts, Andrea communicates her most private emotions and thoughts, conveying them on watercolor paper. A distinctive visual language emerges from her illustrations, made from acrylic ink. The mixture of the Chinese, the Canadian and the European, three very distinct cultures, gave rise to a new, dreamy world, realized through Andrea’s fantastic, surrealist style. The concept of a constant change is also a prevailing theme in her art. Even our identity eventually succumbs to it.  The artist also draws inspiration from the subconscious mind, as well as her daily life and travels. The characters in her drawings and illustrations are representations of the people in her life interpreted through “dream visions”. The color also plays an important role, as she successfully manages to fuse together black and white with a little more vibrant colors.  Wan often begins her pieces with sketches in pencil. She explores the concept and lets her imagination run wild, until she gets the idea for the composition. However, she never makes a precise sketch of the piece, because she dislikes drawing the same thing twice. It is not so rare that she begins working directly on the paper. Next comes the application of layers of ink. The choice of colors also comes while Andrea is creating; it is not aforethought. Her subjects, however, usually have bright hair colors, which is something Andrea is famous for.  While her work serves as a form of expressing her feelings, Wan's art establishes a connection with the audience, yielding very different reactions – from pleasing to disagreeable.  The Berlin-based artist has been praised for her extraordinary pieces by many critics. Her works have also been recognized by some of the world’s most renowned publications such as The New York Times, Computer Arts Magazine, Nylon and The North American Review, to name a few. She has also participated in numerous exhibitions (both solo and group) and was featured in various festivals. In 2013, Wan participated in Pictoplasma Berlin festival, organized by The Pictoplasma Portrait. A year later, in 2014, her work was a part of Knotenpunkt festival, organized by Affenfaust Gallery from Hamburg.  Andrea had her first solo show in 2011 at Collage Collage in Vancouver. Since then, many successful exhibitions took place all over Canada, the US and Europe. When she moved to Germany in 2012, she immediately had her first European exhibition titled Pen Pals, held at Idrawalot Gallery in Germany. That same year, another acclaimed exhibition occurred. Night Travelers was organized by Galeria Cosmo from Barcelona, Spain. However, the two most recent solo shows proved to be the most successful ones.  Mirror Mirror was Andrea’s 2014 exhibition, and it was organized by REM (also known as Rabbit Eye Movement) in Vienna. In 2015, another show followed. Fleeting Seasons was organized by and held at BC Gallery.  Wan received many awards and honors. Her work was nominated for Western Magazines Award for Best Illustration. She received Alberta Magazines Award, and her work also won the Creative Quarterly 20 Professional Illustration. It was also selected for American Illustration and 3x3 Professional Illustration. The artist is represented by two galleries: BC and Urban Spree.  Featured image by Ana Santl. All artworks are courtesy of Andrea Wan and BC",2125
Doze Green,"Doze Green is an American street artist. He was born in New York City in 1964 to a family which consisted of musicians and artists. He is one of the pioneers of street art movement and a b-boy member of the legendary Rock Steady Crew, which popularized breakdancing. The artist is also interested in sculpture, ceramics and animation. He has performed live painting shows.   In the 1970s he started painting subway cars with the Rock Steady Crew, the hip hop pioneers who spent their time breakdancing and tagging graffiti. Doze Green frequently participated in breakdance performances and graffiti writing actions. From urban art and b-boying, the artist shifted to studio work, and public and private mural commissions, such as a large-scale mural in Brazil, painted during Sao Paulo fashion week, and a public mural in Las Vegas, Nevada, which measures 20×80 feet. His murals can be found in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Brazil. His street art background is still visible in his work. His early mentors included Rammellzee, renowned hip-hop and visual artist. Doze Green's distinctive style was shaped by a variety of influences, such as H.P. Lovecraft and theories about space and time, and his interest in experimenting.   Transitioning from the walls of New York to canvas, the artist started creating paintings which are inspired by the art of the Edo Period in Japan. Green uses black gesso and sumi ink, letter forms and chaotic, intuitive brushstrokes in order to create unique and distinctive abstract narrative. The legendary b-boy creates new worlds of fantasy, which stem from the kinetic flow of action painting. His works blend figurative abstraction, fluid line work and organic cubism. The narrative of his works is always changing, presenting illusion of time and immortality.They are based on his graffiti culture roots and metaphysical ideologies. Cubism in his work stems from repetitive, concentric lines and ascending and descending planes, mixed with calligraphy and graffiti. His fragmented characters symbolize his life and his experiences, the people he engaged with in his life time. For Out of Knowhere exhibition, the fifth solo exhibition at the gallery, the artist used brightly colored canvases and applied different degrees of layers, ranging from structurally loose to highly-detailed. The show also included his monochromatic pieces on paper, which portrayed Doze's mentors and friends, the pioneers of street art culture.   Doze Green exhibited his works in many solo and group exhibitions around the world. The venues where he had solo exhibitions include Webbs Gallery in Auckland, New Zealand; Carlos Irizarry Gallery in San Juan, Puerto Rico; 111 Minna Gallery in San Francisco, Space Time Light Gallery in New York, and Jonathan Levine Gallery in New York (which hosted five of his solo exhibitions). His work is featured in numerous private and public collections locally and internationally, in Japan, Australia and Europe. You could see his art in Juxtapoz, Tokon, Anthem, BlackBook, Vibe and on CNN. He is represented by Jonathan Levine Gallery in Chelsea, New York.

Carlos Mare,"Carlos Rodriguez, also known as Carlos Mare, Mare193 or Carlos Mare139 Rodriguez, is an American graffiti artist, painter and sculptor, best known for his works in subway graffiti and metal sculptures. Born in 1965, Mare grew up in East Harlem (previously called Spanish Harlem) in Upper Manhattan, New York. Like many of his contemporaries, Carlos was also a part of a group who created subway graffiti in the 70s and 80s, when this trend reached its peak. This was also a period of his career when he produced some of the most famous pieces under a pseudonym Mare (short for Nightmare). Carlos created side by side with renowned artists such as Dondi White, Noc167, Kel First, Crash and Kase2, to name a few. Mare’s passion for contemporary art enabled him to change and perfect his own writing style.  In 1985, Carlos produced a metal sculpture which had the letter K. With it, the artist made his breakthrough in the art of sculpture. He subsequently produced a series of larger sculptures, where he still employed his signature lettering style. Although in Mare’s later works, a move towards the more convoluted styles of Futurism and Cubism are noticeable, he still stayed true to his graffiti-influenced letters. Rodriguez was commissioned to design the award for BET (short for Black Entertainment Television Awards), given every year to music artists, actors and athletes. Some of the most prominent people in the entertainment industry have received it, including the Academy Award winners Halle Berry and Denzel Washington, and many multiple-Grammy-Award winners such as Beyonce and Jay Z. In 2006, the sculptor received a Webby for the design of the website for the documentary Style Wars. Carlos finished his residency at Brighton University in the UK in 2008, with the project called FreeStyle Archityper. The installation included the sculpture and many of his previous pieces.  Carlos’ sculptural pieces have been highly praised by critics, and have been featured in numerous shows and exhibitions in the US, Europe and Australia. Today, he writes and teaches about the history and development of urban art in NYC. He is represented by David Bloch Gallery based in Marrakech, Morocco.

Steph Cop,"Steph Cop (sometimes spelled Steph.Cop) is a French sculptor, best known for his series of sculptures called Wooden ARO (short for Obsessive Reflex Analysis). Born in 1968 in France, Steph Cop grew up in Paris, where he first made contact with graffiti art. During his formative years in the 80s, Steph rose to prominence when he, together with his crew Control of Paris, painted the fences of the Louvre. Very soon he became one of the most important artists in the Street Art movement. In 1996, Steph pushed the boundaries even further, when he traveled to New York, where he worked with the famous Cope2. Several years later, Steph Cop felt the need to translate his two-dimensional images into three-dimensional figures. He engaged in the world of Designer Toys, and in 2000 produced a series of five figures, titled Imaginary Friends. These figures would later serve him as the basis for his famous AROs.  Steph Cop has made a change of scenery, as the streets of Paris are no longer his “studio”. The artist turns to nature in search of inspiration – more precisely, he turns to the Morvan forest. He now uses a chainsaw as his primary tool to create his signature Wooden ARO sculptures. Carving them in wood, Steph brings forward all the imperfections in the wood, and creates beautiful forms. The artist searches the forest for damaged wood. The search can be long sometimes, but it doesn’t matter because, as Steph says, in order to best understand yourself, you need to lose yourself in a forest. ARO also represents the artist himself. It stems from his mistakes and flaws. It seems like the flaws are not his own, that they belong to us all. And to nature itself. Steph carves our imperfections.  Praised for his work, Steph Cop goes even further. He now produces his AROs in various different materials besides wood, such as steel, porcelain, concrete and vinyl. Apart from having his artworks displayed in one-man shows, Steph Cop has participated in numerous group shows across France, as well. His two most notable solo exhibitions include Neurogamie, a 2012 exhibition organized by the David Bloch Gallery in Marrakech, Morocco, and more recently, Characters, held at the Percept Gallery in Lyon in 2014. He is represented by the David Bloch Gallery and the Kolly Gallery from Zurich.  All images are © Steph Cop, courtesy of David Bloch Gallery",2129
Arne Quinze,"Arne Quinze is a famous Belgian conceptual artist, best known for his project City Like Open-Air Museums consisting of controversial public installations made of wood and metal. Large-scale and massive, his constructions evoke positive reactions from both the public and critics.  Arne Quinze was born in Belgium on December 15, 1971. His career started in the 80s, when he first got involved with graffiti art. Unlike many artists today, Quinze never went through a formal art education. Primarily known for his controversial sculptures and installations, the Belgian also creates paintings and drawings. The latter usually serve as a sort of foundation onto which he “builds” his large-scale installations.  Although Arne creates in variety of media, such as glass, metal and paint, he most often opts for different types of wood. The purpose of his installations is to trigger reaction of people passing by them. He wants people to stop for a second, gather and communicate. Quinze’s artwork is mainly referring to social interaction, communication, contradictions, rhythm, evolution and contrasts. The places where he sets his sculptures are also a part of installations. As the wooden constructions are often brightly colored – Arne usually uses intense orange and red colors – they look out of place compared to their surroundings. By doing this, the artist brings into focus the fast-developing, burning issue of the present – the estrangement and isolation people feel nowadays.  Arne Quinze’s take on art is that it greatly influences people – art can bring out the best in us. However, we seem to have forgotten about this. With the project Cities Like Open-Air Museums, Quinze is trying to revive this interest. Provoking interaction and communication is what prompts the Belgian to create his famous installations. The project involves creating large-scale wooden sculptures, and displaying them in major world metropolises. These artworks give people something to reflect upon, thus striking communication between them. The citizens can also experience their cities anew.   Uchronia is a 2006 public wooden installation by Arne Quinze, his first one. It was held in the Nevada Black Rock desert during the annual Burning Man art and community festival. Each year, thousands of people build Black Rock City, expressing their ideas and thoughts. The festival lasts for seven days, after which all attendees leave without leaving a trace of their presence. Arne’s construction was built using around 150 km of wood – the massive sculpture gave people a feeling of being protected. The way that rays of sun passed through the cracks of Uchronia created beautiful shifting patterns.  When the festival was over, Uchronia was burned down, because the Nevada dessert needs to be “cleaned” and returned to its previous state. There is also a certain symbolism behind setting this installation on fire – we shouldn’t be scared of new beginnings, of change and transition. The burning of Uchronia provoked Quinze’s desired reaction: communication between people.  Two years later, in 2008, Arne displayed another installation in wood, this time in the capital of his native country. The Sequence was set on the Louvian Road in Brussels and it connected the Flemish Parliament to the House of Flemish Representatives. The twisting construction looked like it penetrated both buildings, and thus it created the illusion that the two buildings were connected. Again, The Sequence symbolizes the connection between people, a sort of a bridge that brings us all close together, no matter how diverse we are.  That same year, a similar installation titled The Rebirth, was set in Paris, France. However, unlike The Sequence, this one was displayed only for one evening. It was created in honor of redecorating the hotel Royal Monceau. The Rebirth stretched across the entire building, from the lobby to every room.  The Visitor is a 2009 wooden installation located in Beirut, Lebanon. It is actually a Stilt House made in the artist’s recognizable style. Despite standing on four very thin and fragile legs, the structure is stable. This can be taken as a metaphor: people are like Stilt Houses, seemingly unstable and frail. However, they are adaptable and flexible, and can sustain a lot.  The environment where this sculpture was placed was very unique – the white walls of the surrounding buildings reflected the light, and the whole area was bright. The intense orange color of The Visitor attracted the people from all over Beirut, which in a way, was the intention of both Quinze, and the patrons. They all wanted the natives of this Middle Eastern city to gather around this “stranger”, and experience their city in a different way.  Another installation by Arne Quinze in France was Camille. It was displayed during a 2010 festival in Rouen, which was organized in honor of the old masters of art. The organizers thought that there was no great difference between the traditional and contemporary art, and that in some ways, they complemented each other. For that reason, another festival, Rouen Impressionnée was established. Camille was placed on the Boieldieu Bridge, a very important construction to the locals, since it is the only way across the Seine.  For the duration of the festival, the bridge was closed for traffic, but was still open for the pedestrians. Again, Quinze’s sculpture brought the people together, and inspired them to communicate with each other. Amazed, the citizens of Rouen started a petition to keep the wooden construction on the bridge, even after the festival was over.  Located in Shanghai, China, Red Beacon is yet another successful attempt of Arne Quinze to unite people, and open their minds. During the 2010 World Expo held in Shanghai, where the improvement of urban life was the main theme, the Jing’An district in Shanghai launched an international sculpture project, the first one that was endorsed by the Chinese government.   Another Arne Quinze’s achievement in 2010 was the public installation called My Home My House My Stilt House. It was displayed at the Louisiana Museum for Modern Art, as a part of Living Frontiers of Architecture. The installation explored the concept of “good life nowadays”, as well as the connection between architecture and art. The installation is the product of Arnes’ curiosity about the organization of our private lives, and how we incorporate it into the ways of society. The artist wonders what private property is, and how protective of it we are.   The metal installation titled Rock Strangers was conceived as a multinational exhibition of metal sculptures held in cities such as Paris, Shanghai and Antwerp, to name a few. It started in 2011 and is still active. They “mysteriously” appear in various locations, affecting both the architectural and urban context of environment. They are brightly colored, usually a vivid shade of orange, thus symbolizing the isolation and estrangement people feel. Quinze says that there are many cities in the world that look similar – the only difference being their location. The buildings look identical as well, which makes people feel small. The artist hopes that his Rock Strangers will raise people’s awareness of their existence and ways of life. It is an innate urge that people feel safe, to avoid any unexpected changes, which is the reason why they build walls around them.  The idea behind Rock Strangers is that these odd, out of place objects will open our minds towards new things, that they will help us break our habits. Arne Quinze juxtaposes the vibrancy of his sculptures and the plainness of the environment they are set in. It is that very difference that evokes interaction between people.  In 2014 and 2015, Arne Quinze chose the center of Mons, Belgium (more precisely the Rue Nimy) as the home for his two separate wooden installations of the same name – The Passenger. The choice of Rue Nimy was not an arbitrary one, as the street has been an important trading center throughout the history of this Belgian city. This installation highlights the importance of Rue Nimy, as many culturally diverse people pass through it.    The concept of Stilt Houses is present in many of Quinze’s public installations. Arne compares them with humans, as they only seem like they are shaky and unstable, but are in fact adaptable to any situation, and can survive in any context. The perfect Stilt House is tall, watching over everything. This symbolizes our aspirations and strivings towards going higher and further in life. Arne first created Stilt Houses in 2007.   “There is no Chaos, only Structure” – this is the thought that is behind every artwork by Arne. The artwork Chaos in particular was first intended to be a self-portrait of the artist. However, the more he studied it, the quicker he realized that it represented the society and the “chaos” that rules in it. Countless small sticks are stuck to each other, making chaos. Only they are not – there is a structure behind them. First created in 2009, Chaos symbolizes life. Everything is a matter of rhythm in life.   Highly acclaimed, Arne Quinze’s artworks have been featured in numerous festivals and exhibitions, both one-man and group. This earned him an international renown. He married twice, first in 2009 with Barbara Becker, a German-American designer and model. They separated in 2011, and a year later, Quinze married An Lemmers, a TV and radio personality in Belgium. The artist is represented by the David Bloch Gallery in Marrakech, Morroco.  All images are © Arne Quinze",2130

Charming Baker,"Alan Baker, better known as Charming Baker, is a British contemporary artist who explores themes such as life, love, joy, death and despair in his artistic practice. Filled with a touch of dark humour and hidden meanings, his pieces often have associative references to the classics and historic works of art. Baker, who is a rapidly rising star of the art world, works in a range of different media including painting, sculpture, prints and drawing.   Charming Baker was born in 1964 in Hampshire, a county on the southern coast of England in the UK. His father was a respected Commando in the British Army, so the artist spend his childhood travelling round with him. After several years living in Singapore, Malaysia, Germany and Wales, they finally settled in Ripon, the Borough of Harrogate, North Yorkshire.  Baker left school at the age of fifteen to work different manual jobs. Six years later he moved to England’s capital and sneaked into the graphic design course at the one of the leading centres for art and design education - Central Saint Martins, where he graduated in 1988. The influence of the studies in graphic design can be seen in the patterned backgrounds of his pieces he likes to paint on most of his canvases.    In the years that followed the graduation, Baker survived, bringing up a family of five children, by teaching part-time and working as a commercial designer for clients such as the BBC and the Daily Telegraph. At his free time he was producing conceptual oil paintings not dissimilar in theme and style to the ones he is producing now. In 2006 he met the journalist and graffiti-art enthusiast Tim Fennell who turned up at Baker’s flat, bought four paintings and persuaded the artist to let him organize an exhibition at the Truman Brewery, a hire space on Brick Lane preferred by many urban artists. The show was sold out.   The turning point of his career happened in 2008 when he went to Los Angeles to take part in a debate on urban art. Also, there was Roger Klein, the creative director for Pat Magnarella, one of the pop music business’s most successful managers who manages platinum disc rock bands Green Day and Goo Goo Dolls. Magnarella checked Baker’s work on the internet and liked what he saw. He bought two pieces from Baker's small LA show, and flew to London to meet the artist. Baker’s first exhibition under new management was held in east London in 2009. The show has been very successful, attracting large numbers of visitors and a lot of attention of art lovers across the world.    For the past seven years, Baker’s work has been included in many international sell-out individual and collective shows. His fans include the widely-known British artist Damien Hirst, alongside prolific collectors and gallerists like Frank Cohen, Harry Blain and New York dealer Alberto Mugrabi. He has enjoyed one of the swiftest rises the art market has seen in recent years. His pieces sell for tens of thousands of pounds each.    Baker works in a wide range of media exploring the dichotomy between life and death, love and terror, and joy, or rather, the intrinsically linked aspects of human experience. His paintings are often filled with a dark humour. He is also known for employing unconventional methods in the process – including drilling and cutting the pieces, as well as shooting his work with a gun. In that way, he puts to question the preciousness of art. Though he is primarily a painter, in last several years he has made sculptures of different materials. Charming Baker is represented by Hang-Up Gallery and Verso Contemporary. He has exhibited his work at New York Studio Gallery, New York, and Mercer Street Studios, London, among others.   In 2012 he has teamed up with a British designer Sir Paul Smith to produce a sculpture to commemorate the year of London hosting the Olympics. Their piece made from aluminium and steel, and called Triumph in the Face of Absurdity, was on view in the Victoria and Albert Museum in July the same year.   Charming Baker and his wife, Tanya, have five children, two each from previous marriages and one between them. His step-daughter is often featured in his paintings.  ",2143

Zest,"Zest is a pseudonym of Franck Noto, a French street artist whose talent and style established him as one of the leading graffiti authors of the entire street scene in France. Zest's initial artworks used to be very figurative and realistic, embedded with the loose graffiti codes he became familiar with early on - however, his style evolved over time and Noto eventually developed his own unique urban vocabulary, turning it into a much more personal form of expression. Currently, his progression towards abstraction is asserting itself and one can easily notice Zest's attraction for depicting decomposed movements.  Zest started to experiment with graffiti at the age of 15. Like many of his street colleagues, he was as well a completely self-taught artist. Enchanted by the endless possibilities and the absence of any real creative bound, Noto was immediately attracted to the unconventional and provocative art form of graffiti. As most simmilar artists did, Noto started out with lettering but soon began to experiment with figurative and realistic styles. It should be noted that he particularly liked painting on large surfaces and this feature is quite clear in Zest's mature art. Franck Noto has been influenced for a long time by the figurative style like the one artist Mode 2 has in his arsenal, but, as Zest gradually opened himself to abstract and contemporary art, authors such as Piet Mondrian, Futura, Pierre Soulage and Jackson Pollock started to be a strong influence on him. However, above all, Zest finds inspiration in the world of fashion and architecture.  Nowadays, Zest's studio is the place where explosions of colors take place and where atypical paintings come to a sudden life. Also, this is the place where the artist is able to explore different techniques before introducing them to the street. Concerning his own art, Zest explains it with the following statement: I am dedicated to artworks that synthesize my various influences. My universe is none other than that of suggestion: the letters of my pseudonym, cubic forms, feminine contours. But talking about my work is obviously accompanied by a discourse on color, an obsession for me. Mixing paint rollers, Posca marker pens, brushes, spray paints and projection techniques, Zest continues to evolve as an author. Of course, the influence of graffiti never leaves his portfolio regardless of how much Noto attempts to turn his style towards a different path. The perpetual overlap, the bulimia of painting absolutely thrills this artist and Zest wants to show us the energy obtained through the flow of the gesture and, logically, the colors.   Regardless of how conceptually far he gets from his initial artistic explorations, Zest always maintains a connection with the graffiti style that allowed him to develop as an author in the first place. The feeling of freedom, being far from the conservative codes of art and constantly experimenting with new methods - all of that is still present in the works of Franck Noto who uses these concepts as a basis to his visual vocabulary. This artist is represented by Galerie Nicolas Xavier, Kolly Gallery, At Down Gallery, Bomma Gallery, and Bartoux Gallery.  ",2147

Matthew Craven,"Matthew Craven is an American contemporary artist born in Grand Rapids, in 1981. He is well-known for his history based collages. Craven got his BA from Michigan State University in 2004, and his MFA from the School of Visual Arts, New York, in 2010.  Aged 22, Craven enrolled at art school, and that fact made possible for him to create his own style, without being heavily influenced by existing trends in art. When the artist moved to New York, he came as an abstract painter, but knew that wasn’t the right way to express himself. It was his friend giving him a bunch of frames with American history illustrations inside. Craven was seeking a new way of expressing, so he just started drawing on top of these illustrations. Much to his surprise, the reactions were positive, so he decided to further explore the possibilities of collages.  The little things are what really matters to Craven. In the process of reconstructing the image in the size of a book page, his art doesn’t look like it’s a pile of things just glued and smashed together. For a long time, he felt rather insecure about receiving credit for altering and using other people’s images, but he is slowly finding a way to make his work more personalized, so he can call it his own. Art is so much more than aesthetic appreciation, it is deep existential exploration. Craven wants for people to stop and think where we are, and how we got here. He wants us to think about history, and the passage of time. The artist likes how he feels small in such a big universe, and draws inspirations from that feeling of humbleness.    He is represented by Mini Galerie, Amsterdam, NL.  All images courtesy of the artist.",2149
Graphic Surgery,"Graphic Surgery is a collaborative art duo of Dutch artists Erris Huigens and Gysbert Zijlstra, who share the same passion for graphic, graffiti, modern cities and urban environments. Born 4 days apart from each other, in 1978, Erris and Gysbert discovered this mutual source of inspiration during their educative years at an art academy, and started collaborating in 2000.  The work of Graphic Surgery includes paintings and mixed media on canvas, murals in abandoned places and spaces, videos and installations, all created in their signature systematic style of diagonal lines, abstract geometric planes and a mostly monochromatic black and white scheme. Some elements are recurring in their works, such as linear industrial structures and construction cranes.  Main focus of their art is on material, depth and layering, and very limited use of color. Different forms and productions of Graphic Surgery owe as much to the urban environment that surrounds them as they do to the history of modern art and design, with De Stijl and Constructivism being clear reference points.   Their work has been exhibited in numerous group shows and street art festivals throughout the Netherlands, and also in Paris, Brussels, and Luxemburg. At the moment, Graphic Surgery duo is collaborating on various projects with interaction and multimedia artists. In addition, they run the design agency EHGZ. They are represented by several galleries, including Galerie Celal in Paris.  Featured image - photo credit Ralph Roelse Other images copyright © the artist",2150
Bradley Hart,"Bradley Hart is a Canadian artist known for using a bubble wrap to express his art vision through a series of the photorealistic portraits, made by injecting paint into bubbles.   Hart was born in Toronto, Canada. He grew up in a family that designed and built restaurants, working with wood and metal in workshops, where Bradley got interested in the whole creative process - so as long as he can remembers he was fascinated by deconstructing stuff, or, better said: taking things apart. He was very much interested in a structure of created object: the parts and their interconnection.  When he was only 11 years old, his parents enrolled him to a private art school Thornton Hall, extremely traditional in a way that he was forced to replicate in pencil renaissance master’s pieces, the whole day through. That pretty rigorous training was crucial and effective in shaping his artistic skill. Bradley Hart earned his B.A. at the University of Toronto, majoring Visual Art and Semiotic Communication Theory but with a minor in Cinema Studies.  This artist’s artistic process is based on a different steps and techniques – from injections and impressions, wasted paint and assemblages, among others.  Hart's series titled Injection paintings is ranging from celebrities portraits or friends to snapshots of life itself. The best known work from this series is definitely a portrait of Steve Jobs made from more than 16,000 individual bubbles and almost 90 different hues of paint. This artist claims that there is no such thing as a pure waste, he actually recycles absolutely anything he can - syringes, old pots, and even paint drippings from the studio floor. These pieces are titles either Created Waste or the Wasted Paint (created solely out of accidental spills). This artist is represented by Anna Zorina Gallery in New York City.  ",2151
Sergej Vutuc,"Sergej Vutuc is a Bosnian-Croatian artist, known for his DIY art. He is passionate skateboarder, photographer, zine maker and a musician. Sergej was born in Doboj - a city in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was raised in Zagreb, capital of Croatia. He started to get interested in skating during the 80s, when he was just a kid. A film Thrashin’ started everything for this artist.   After a while he discovered zines - a small circulation self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images mostly reproduced via photocopier. It was usually related to punk and hard core culture. Sergej bought his first one in 1992, and in 1995 he already started a label titled Get Off and was played in a band. The themes Sergej processes are those of a development of the modern society – the final battle between the nature and a concrete. However, this artist does not seem to lose sight from the human everlasting need to expand consciousness and live through personal imagination – proving so that skateboarders are not just some detached voyeurs of urban modernity.   A sustained engagement with the environment created a modern nomad who is in constant search for constructive fun. One important element of this modern liberation is, for sure, realization that “whatever you have grown up with, isn't something you are stuck with”. One can and should change all the time, investing himself completely.  Sergej’s style is primarily abstract, his photo compositions are centered on skate culture and his travels.

She received her Bachelor of Visual Communications from KVB College of Visual Communications, Noth Sydney, in 1995, and has studied Painting and Drawing at Eastern Suburbs Evening College, Waverley Woollahra, and Drawing and Fine Art Studies at Nowra Tafe, Bomaderry. Environment is a huge inspiration, as well as the people who surround her. Landscape West can imagine herself in is perfect inspiration, just as is the weather. She prefers painting outdoors, but occasionally works in studio, mainly when working on portraits. Her dining room, with its amazing light and a great view, also serves as a studio.  West takes a fresh approach, making amazing textual surfaces with tick strokes of a brush. All of her pieces are her personal response to a specific moment in time, and she becomes completely engulfed in the environment while she paints. Her palette is subtle and she applies paint boldly. She has exhibited her work throughout Australia, and also in New York and London. West has won Portia Geach Prize from SH Ervin Gallery in 2013 and 2014, New South Wales Parliament Plein Air Painting Prize, Salon Des Refuses, the Wynne Prize, Charlatan Ink Prize in Manhattan, New York, and has won the Pacific Palms Art Prize 3 times.

Atsushi Kaga,"Atsushi Kaga is a Japanese visual artist, working in mixed media, painting, drawing, animation and sculpture. He is best known for his practice steeped in popular culture. Born in 1978 in Tokyo, the artist got his education at the Tama Art Institute in Tokyo, graduating in 1997, and at the National College of Art and Design – NCAD in Dublin, where he got his BA in Fine Art Painting in 2005. Atsushi also got a diploma at Coláiste Stiofáin Naofa, Cork, in 2001.  Inspired by the Japanese manga culture, the world of modern toys and electronics, and a combination of text and surreal reference, Kaga uses his unique cast of characters to tell quite profound stories about personal experiences. Behind the playful and surreal facade of Atsushi Kaga’s misleadingly simple work lurks much darker territory wherein the artist confronts serious issues of cultural politics, sexuality, death, paranoia, social relationships, the complex search for personal identity and the daily philosophical crises of the harsh realities of the world.    The darkly playful world of Kaga’s oeuvre is inhabited by a variety of colorful anthropomorphized characters. The cast is led by Usacchi – a cute but a little mischievous rabbit, the artist’s alter ego. Besides Usacchi, his panda father and kangaroo mother are, for example, all facets of the artist’s personae. Bunny depicts Kaga’s silly side, while Kumacchi – a drug-addicted bear injured in a car accident – presents his dark side and the forever-weeping Panda, his melancholic side.   Kaga is one of the artists supported by the Montblanc Young Artist World Patronage. The project carries the idea of giving young and upcoming artists the opportunity to present their artwork to a broader and international audience and to the art scene. Therefore, more than 400 Montblanc boutiques worldwide are transformed into art galleries and present one particular artwork simultaneously for a couple of weeks.   Kaga has participated in many one-man and collective exhibitions at a variety of international institutions, including mother’s tankstation, Dublin, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Nicolas Krupp Gallery, Basel, Switzerland, Butler Gallery, Kilkenny, Ireland, Mermaid Arts Centre, Bray, Fenton Gallery, Cork, Temple Bar Gallery, Dublin, Sandra and David Bakalar Gallery, MassArt, Boston, and Location One, New York.

Neil Beloufa,"Using the balanced and reasonable combination of reality and fiction, Neïl Beloufa creates complex narratives, credible and real, despite their fictional source. With the sense of irony, his vision emerges from general knowledge and ideas that each viewer brings into the exhibition space. He masterly manages the narratives, moving between the real and imaginative, producing a new approach. Beloufa’s installations, made of Plexiglas and plywood, with foam walls and pop-culture references, represent the base for his films, at the same time expanding and obscuring these moving images. He usually projects his recorded material onto sculptures and installations that reflects the images and elements of the video.   This French artist Algerian origin studied at École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris where he received his Visual Arts National Diploma. He continued his education at Cooper Union, New York, and CalArts, Valencia. His work is shown all over the world, in numerous solo and group exhibitions, and on prestigious film festivals. Basing his work on jokes, Beloufa is questioning some serious social issues. He thinks that people shouldn’t be too serious even when they reconsider the very important subjects. He is using the joke as the way to show that art shouldn’t be clever.     For his current exhibition Project 102 in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Beloufa made his architectonic installations by hand, using the inexpensive materials and techniques. His interesting combination of sculptures and moving images creates unique viewing spaces. Treating the projections like objects, he is spreading images onto different surfaces. The artist asserts the technological development with the social moment by revealing the cables and presenting the images through closed-circuit television. In the center of his presentation is a video People’s passion, lifestyle, beautiful wine, gigantic glass towers, all surrounded by water. In a film which imitates popular genres of science fiction and infomercial, a group of people in the undetermined city with lots of enthusiasm describing them adore of urban culture.    His installations sometimes contain different modular pieces, which consists of common objects. Creating the multidimensional representation, this works engages the viewer to jump from one suggestion to another. Having the familiar landscape in front of them, the visitors are often confused by unusual propositions and layout of the objects. For example, in work Maya SP, the effect, the causes and the fall, the viewer meets with something far from his understanding. With the reverse perception of the common objects, he is trying to find a hidden truth of the old historic event. Using the material which can be bought in the store, Baloufa is showing his interest in standardization. Although they are made of familiar stuff, his installations have a unique stamp, some kind of signature when the artist marks them with his own pee or the cigarette butt.    Always trying to make the relation between the observer and the fiction he sees, Baloufa claims that film is not happening on the screen, but in the middle of one’s relation to it. He aims to provoke people to ask questions, he wants them to be caught, but not believe it. His films have specific conceptual frames, but the sculptures and installations have their own presence. Creating the documents of them, he is trying to represent the life as the parasite, bringing the experience towards the understanding in the real time. With the attempt to create a linear platform, Baloufa wants to place everything on the equal level. Considering himself as an editor, not a sculptor or a filmmaker, he is the one who edits the content and ideas.    All images used for the illustrative purpose only",2155

MonkeyBird,"MonkeyBird is a duo of French contemporary artists born and working in Bordeaux. They are known for using symbolic anthropomorphism in their artworks. That means they are depicting wild animals in urban areas. The duo is active since 2010. They work in a stencil, collages, spray painting, drawing, carving, silkscreen and engraving.  The duo consists of Blow the Bird and Temor the Monkey, and they incarnate the two faces of humankind, the monkey being the realist, and the bird being the dreamer. Members of the crew have BTS in graphic design, BTS in object design and MA in industrial design. In their work, a search for balance between dreams and reality is visible, as their goal is to become the alchemists of the living desire. The artists are inspired by ephemeral monumentality, religious paintings and the art nouveau.   Before they started working on the walls of museums and institutions, both artists worked on the street. In fact, that’s how they met in the first place. One of them was looking for a change in his graffiti and the other a change in framework and identity. Unconsciously, the symbols came to them naturally, giving their approach an intellectual note, unlike the early works, which were primarily an instinctive need. MonkeyBird crew loves working on antique doors, waste walls, abandoned and industrial buildings.   Their mission is to transcribe social themes into walls, through the use of animal totems and elaborate symbolism. Most of the inspiration comes from the sacred or lyrical works like illuminations, stained glass, and architectural ornamentation seen in the illustrations of ""Arts and Crafts"" or Japanese prints. They leave their signature marks all around the world. They are represented by GCA Gallery in Nice, France.  ",2157
Jorinde Voigt,"Jorinde Voigt is a Berlin-based artist known for her intricate works that evoke countless associations and varying sensations in observers. She focuses mainly on drawings, but also produces paintings, collages and installations.   Through the media of drawing and painting, Voigt creates remarkable and highly original abstract forms that are elegantly interconnected by a complex system of lines of text or movement. Her large-scale pieces are characterized by the vibrant polarities such as order and accident, meticulousness and impulsivity. These seemingly abstract arrangements address a very wide range of subjects — from weather and geography to music, literature, and philosophy.  Suggesting the appearance of scientific diagrams, musical scores, numbers or word fragments, her lyrical notations are rendered in a unique visual language that is not easily deciphered. She undertakes the attempt to make objective sense of the world and to reveal an invisible world that is complex in its shifting movements and overlapping influences.   Born to scientist parents in 1977 in Frankfurt am Main, the artist studied philosophy, comparative literature and sociology at the Free University in the capital of Germany, before enrolling in the Berlin University of the Arts where she graduated in 2003. One year later, she earned her Master of Visual Arts from the same University. During her school years 1986-1996, Voigt had learnt cello at the Academy of Sonic Arts in Darmstadt. She received the Otto Dix Prize in 2008 and the Daniel & Florence Guerlain Contemporary Drawing Award in 2012. Since 2014, Voigt has been teaching conceptual drawing and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Munich.  Jorinde Voigt’s work has been included in numerous individual and collective exhibitions throughout the world including such art spaces as the David Nolan Gallery, New York; the Galerie Klüser, Munich; the Horst-Janssen-Museum, Oldenburg; the Lisson Gallery, Milan; the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (S.M.A.K.), Gent; and Watermill Center, New York, to name a few.

Jerome Mesnager,"What do the Great Wall of China and the Red Square in Moscow have in common with many walls of Paris streets? The answer is hiding in the street art: l'Homme en blanc or the White Man – a drawn silhouette of a man, imagined as a symbol of light, strength and peace, created in 1983 by the French artist Jérôme Mesnager. Educated for a cabinet maker and the comics’ author, this artist distinguished himself during the rise of the free figuration in the early 1980s, together with Blek le rat, Miss Tic, Jef Aérosol and Némo.   Jérôme Mesnager was born in Colmar, in the Alsace region of northeastern France. He attended École Boulle – a school of fine arts&crafts and applied arts, named after André-Charles Boulle, a well-known cabinetmaker from the XVII century. In 1974, he got his degree in cabinetmaking course. For a while, he was teaching this craft at Boulle. However, the city and its streets were calling him to adorn them with some excitingly ephemeral art. In 1979, Mesnager made a smooth transition towards a bit more urban art by attending Yves Got's and Georges Pichard's comics’ course at The Duperré School of Applied Arts. Pichard was known for many BD Franco-Belgian comics magazine covers and Got was a creator of Didou, a small animated rabbit hero. In 1982, gravitating fast to his current artistic expression, Mesnager co-founded a Zig-Zag in 1982. This group gathered young artists, eager to occupy streets and abandoned factories with their graffiti and performances, so their voice could be heard, or better said: seen.  On 16 January 1983 the White Man (sometimes translated as The White Body) was born, changing this artist’s life forever. Since that moment, Jérôme is on a mission, conducting it all around the world. The mission consists of spreading the happiness and peace through drawings of the White Man. In time, this silhouette became widely known as a symbol of positive living and the happiness of being free. The White Man is more than 30 years old now, but did not back away a bit in his task, remaining a focal point of Mesnager's painting.  One of Mesnager’s most interesting project is the great mural done in 1995, in the Ménilmontant Street in Paris and titled C'est nous les gars de Ménilmontant, a neighborhood in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, known to locals as Ménilmuche. This artwork is sort of a homage to Matisse’s La Danse, created between 1909 and 1910. In 2006, the White Man “moved in” the Hotel des Academies et des Arts in Paris, inhabiting 20 hotel bedrooms, some communal areas inside the hotel and a giant exterior wall of the fifth floor.  Another interesting location the White Man found himself at, are the famous Parisian catacombs, in its off-limits area, closed but regularly invaded by the urban cavers called cataphylls.  This artist created his own way of fighting the universal malady of a modern man, depicting l'Homme en blanc all over the world, a reminder for the human kind that this malady is not incurable and that we can go back to our true self: a high minded species, capable of empathy and happiness. One simply couldn't ask for more. This artist is represented by Galerie Brugier-Rigai from Paris.  All images copyright © the artist",2161
Neil Welliver,"American artist Neil Welliver is best known for his woodcuts and large-scale landscapes of rural Maine. Most of his paintings feature nature images of streams, evergreens, beaver houses, and birches. However, the artist also painted the female nudes bathing in the creeks and his children canoeing. Celebrated as the great contributor to contemporary landscape painting Welliver had great respect for the natural beauty he tried to capture. Today the artist's works are part of numerous private and public collections, including The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. Neil Gavin Welliver was born in Millville, Philadelphia, in 1929. He graduated from the Philadelphia College of Art and went on to study under the tutelage of renowned artists Josef Albers and Burgoyne Diller at Yale School of Art, from which he graduated with an MFA. Later he would hold teaching positions at several universities, including Yale, Cooper Union, and the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Art. While he held the position of chairman, several reports of sexual harassment were raised against the artist. Throughout Welliver's career, his style constantly evolved. Influenced by Albers' color theories, he began creating abstract color field paintings. Gradually he evolved to the realistic watercolor depictions of small rural towns. In the 1960s, when he relocated to Maine, he began painting nature scenes, often hiking several miles carrying heavy equipment on his back. Welliver said:   The artist never concerned himself with defining his art as belonging to realism or abstraction. Instead, he claimed his work stood in between two styles, bridging them. Accordingly, he never associated himself with any specific schools of art. The great inspiration for his work was the painting by such renowned artists as Joseph Albers and Piet Mondrian. The most important aspects for the artist were color interactions, perception, and expressing the beauty of the world ""with utmost awareness."" Neil Welliver had his first solo show at Alexandra Grotto in Philadelphia in 1954, followed by his first solo exhibition in New York at the Stable Gallery (1962). By the 1970s, the artist entirely devoted his time to painting landscapes. Welliver said: In 1962 Welliver bought a 106-acre farm in Maine and, over the years, expanded the land he owned to 1,600 acres. The artist never saw to capture the colors he saw perfectly but rather their natural beauty. Unfortunately, his private life suffered many tragedies, including the death of his wife and son. Upon his death in 2005, part of his land was given to Maine's Coastal Mountains Land Trust. ",2162

Joan Cornella,"Have you ever seen something disturbing, but couldn’t take your eyes off of it and weren’t quite sure why are you appealed by it? Well, that happens to the majority of people when they see Joan Cornellà's dark-humored comics for the first time. Distorted bodies, extreme discomfort, bizarre characters and awkward, unexplainable situations construct the core of his wordless, one-page comics. The twisted comics of a Spanish artist attracted a huge following on social networks, counting over three million Facebook followers.  Not much is known about Joan Cornellà’s personal life. He was born in Barcelona in 1981, where he received his fine arts training. As a graduate, Joan worked for several publications and newspapers as an illustrator, such as La Cultura del Duodeno, El Periódico, Ara and El Jueves. His drawings found their place even in The New York Times. The artist finds inspiration in the comedy sketches of Monty Python and the work of other cartoonists like Helge Reumann and Glen Baxter. Some other, not quite so usual sources include the aggressive behavior, blackouts, temporary blindness and even the ingestion of bad food that causes hallucinations. Since recently, Cornella has found the work of a Spanish cartoonist Molg H to be very inspiring.   Through his gruesome comic tales, Joan tackles a range of complex and taboo themes which are often avoided. Some of his subject matters include suicide, self-mutilation, racism, abortion, murder, homophobia, disability, deformity, and sadistic or oblivious violence. Even if all of this doesn’t quite sound funny, Cornellà masterfully manages to create hilarious narratives which often leave the viewer in awe. His comics are populated almost exclusively by smiling psychopaths who invariably turn even the most mundane situation into an amusing and cringe-inducing farce.   The opposite of all the morbidity seen in these wordless comics is Cornellà’s choice of soothing, lovely colors and his overall style of drawing which looks like it was taken from children’s books. Cornellà is especially known for recurrently drawing an almost vacant smiling expression on his characters. This face and smile, which completes so many of his strips, became one of Cornellà’s well-known trademarks. Uncomfortable laughter aside, Cornellà’s work occasionally carries an unapologetic, in-your-face message. As an example, the artist created comics in which he directly highlights police brutality against minorities.   The world is twisted. New artworks of Joan Cornellà demonstrate it the best. In the past, the artist has gotten the viewers used to his dark style through a myriad of unconventional scenarios. People’s connection to the social media, naked selfie ‘culture’, difficult political topics about addiction and gender issues, no subject is off limits. If you’re nearby, check out his new solo exhibition at Spoke Art Gallery, which will take place from 3-26th March.   The world is sinking into the absurdity. The need to be accepted and popular, situations happening around the world that really shouldn’t be happening, or general human stupidity – all of them are troublesome, but there isn’t much that can be done about it. Well, if you aren’t as talented and inspired as Joan Cornellà. He is doing his best to expose and ridicule these things, and the people still thinking with their own heads have recognized it. So, no matter how dark, twisted, and even demented his works may seem, it just isn’t that important. The viewers will sometimes be disgusted by the visual style, but in the era of political correctness, some things must be said, and the artist has found the perfect way of saying them. One thing is certain - once you see Joan Cornellà’s comics, you’ll surely never forget it.  The artist is represented by Spoke Art gallery, located in San Francisco.

Alex Garant,"The eyes are windows to the soul, or so they say. However, the eyes in Alex Garant’s artworks are so much more. They will make you think about yourself, your youth, the choices you made, all of that while you feel like you’re walking in a hall of mirrors, and in all of the reflections is you. Paintings possess the certain autobiographical moments from the artist’s life, but they are also meant as a means to make the viewers think about themselves. Queen of Double Eyes is saturating her canvases in visual stimuli and is clearly overstimulating her audience, creating pieces which both excite and overwhelm all at once.   The way she creates makes her painting realistic, but surreal at the same time. Traditional techniques of making portraits are combined with graphic quality, making her artworks widely recognizable. The core of her work is the pattern, she will duplicate elements, use symmetry and image superposition, creating an almost perfect optical illusion. The figures are trying to escape themselves but are also given some of the artist’s soul. It’s a very distinctive version of combining two persons, using a model as a beginning point, but also enriching the artworks with Garant’s own feelings.   The idea behind Garant’s work is for artworks to become an extra-sensory experience and to challenge the viewers to adjust and adapt so they could comprehend the pieces. Beginning with a regular portrait in pencil, the same portrait is added, and then the artist plays with superposition until the balance is achieved. The sketches are then transferred to canvas and Garant can start painting. She works alla prima, so the both images are painted at the same time.  Also, in the time when self-portrait (selfies) is a part of people’s daily habits, the artist wants to push the limits of portraiture in two-dimensional media. Applying her techniques makes something banal transform into extraordinary.   Her second solo exhibition (third coming in July in Portugal), called Wakefulness, is being held at the Spoke Art gallery. It will be on display until February 27th, so if you’re nearby, be sure to check it out. The recent work is placed somewhere between hallucinations and psychology. The idea of traditional beauty is somewhat twisted, as the viewers find the artworks undoubtedly beautiful, but just can’t look at for too long. There is a continuation is portraying only females, as she is keeping her work autobiographical to an extent. Garant is describing the paintings as deeply personal, and they are completely relatable, both to Alex and the viewers.   Garant remembers her childhood when her mother drew faces so she could paint them with wax pastels. The artist recalls with those female faces with full lips and big eyes. Those memories, in combination with the idea of self-portraiture, marked her career. She studied Visual Arts at Notre-Dame–De-Foy College, just outside the Quebec City, where she graduated in 2001. Unfortunately, she had a heart attack in 2012, and that really made Garant open her eyes and realize that life is too short. So, she decided to do what she loves and what fulfills her, and that is painting. Now she leads a healthy life, goes to the gym and does what she loves – paints. Actually, the gym has become such a big part of her life, allowing her to reset both physically and mentally and helping her to channel the energy positively.

Bordalo II,"Inspiration can come from a lot of different ways to artists, and some choose to dedicate their practice to problems affecting the society on a global scale. Art has often been used to avert the attention towards certain contemporary issues, reaching out to the viewers through the appeal of artistic expression. It’s less than easy to do, as the artists are, in a way, forced to incorporate the issue within their practice, and Bordalo II does it with great success. Creating murals that utilize various discarded objects, he depicts animals that are affected by the same, possibly perishing to the effects of such waste existing in their natural habitat.  Based in Lisbon, the Portuguese artist Artur Bordalo, known as Bordalo II, is becoming increasingly popular not only for his keen artistic eye, but for the message he is trying to carry across through his work. Collecting various discarded materials around the city, Bordalo II incorporates stuff like old tires, appliances, aluminum cans, and other objects into his street art installations. Although each piece is comprised of trash, the final product can’t be further away from it - forming various animals that are directly affected by the junk used to create the actual work, the artist sends a message of the danger of pollution. Many species have already found their way into Bordalo’s portfolio; depicting the penguin, rabbit, grasshopper, raccoon, and many other species across the city, Bordalo II brings closer that which might perish if we keep building upon the blocks of pollution.    Exploring and experimenting as he creates, Bordalo II forms a practice of constant innovation, never failing to amaze with his large-scale works. Following in the footsteps of his grandfather who also painted the city walls, Bordalo chose to visually entice the fellow inhabitants while engaging in a dialog about a concern that encompasses all of us. Depicting the nature’s representatives in an innovative way, the artist can be credited with being more than just a rising contemporary figure. The artist is represented by GraffitiStreet. ",2171

Jason Sims,"Natural human instinct is to explore, to define every experience and perception in his mind. Standing in the dark space rounded with colorful lighted illusional holes, the viewer is challenged to reconsider its own constructed world, desiring illusion to happen. Jason Sims’ light boxes and installations are entirely hand-made. He is constructing in wood, mirror, reflective glass, MDF and LED lights, presenting an endless expanse of infinite possibility. His aim is to create the perfect environment for the viewer’s contemplation.   He includes the mirrors in space, so that visitors, looking at them, can see themselves in a conjunction with sculptures and become part of it. All of his works shares the similar ideas, but at the same time, they are totally different. His multi-media artwork is using colorful lights and geometrical shapes to create optical illusions. Looked from the outside, Sims’ sculptures have strictly limited shapes, but their infinity is inside, extending beyond physical possibilities. Those objects seem weightless, floating on the walls, attracting views with theirs hidden lightning. The mirrors contribute to the entire impression of drawing force, making the possibility of different angles of observation.   Sims’ exhibition, titled From Where I Stand, was consisted of the works inspired by American minimalist Donald Judd, Australian modernist Frank Hinder, and French impressionist Camille Pissarro. Illusion continues to play the main role and the created space includes viewer as composite part of it. His physical experience is challenged with bright-colored lights which are opening new, different dimension. Since Sims graduated with a Bachelor of Visual Arts (Honours) from the University of South Australia in 2000, he has had several solo exhibitions and numerous group shows throughout Australia and abroad, including Hong Kong, the UK and the USA. His work is held in major public and private collections, including Artbank and the Art Gallery of Western Australia. He has been a finalist for the Tom Malone Prize for the past 3 years. His latest award is SALA Advertiser Contemporary Art Prize, for the most outstanding work in any medium.   Creating the illusion of infinite hole through the construction of a series of light boxes that reflect space upon itself, Jason Sims’ work prompt’s the viewer to wrestle with what he sees and knows. This Australian artist is interested in the ways in which people create meaning in their lives and how perception and choice directly impact our reality, exploring its meaning in our existence. Jason Sims is represented by The Cat Street Gallery.  ",2176
Kadar Brock,"American contemporary artist Kadar Brock is known for his large-scale abstract paintings. Created by the laborious process of layering, his work is highly textured, discordant, and topographical in nature. The artist uses several techniques, including paintings, priming, scraping, sanding, and once again painting. Merging elements of Abstract Expressionism and graffiti he produces compositions that capture the eye. The unique style has ensured that Brock’s auction is always sold out. His works have been exhibited in a number of public institutions all over the world, including Thierry Goldberg, NYC; Brand New Gallery, Milan; Gallery Diet, Miami; Horton Gallery, Berlin; Vigo Gallery, London; Sperone Westwater, NYC; Saamlung, Hong Kong and Praz-Delavallade, Paris. Kadar Brock (born in 1980), has graduated from Cooper Union School of Art in New York City with a BFA. Throughout his career, he has put the ritual at the heart of his artistic practice. As a multitasker, he often is working on several paintings at the same time. The artist draws inspiration from family history, personal memories, and emotions. Also incorporated in his works are ever-present figurative components, especially characters found in Eastern and Western films, graphic novels, and comics. The artist’s multilayered work creates several compositions one on top of the other. Each one possesses a distinct record of the artist's emotions, as well as psychological, physical elements. With the use of several materials, such as acrylic, spray paint, oil, house paint, and Flashe, Brock slowly deconstructs the original layer until it is unrecognizable. However, it is always present, peeking through the finished surface as an afterthought, a simple shadow, shape, or a single color.          Brock often works on a single canvas for several years. The physical and emotional process is necessary as he seeks to accomplish the reverse archaeology of the self. Thus the artist creates works that are imbued with a fine balance between memory, emotion, body, and psychology. At the heart of his work are subtraction and addition. Brock’s paintings in essence are perfect recordings of their creation, that draw the eye to look deeper, for they evoke the ideas of artistic labor, memoirs, and ghosts. At the exhibition titled Cast with flashback cast with flashback about his methodology Brock said: With a career spanning more than 17 years, the artist has had numerous solo shows, including In Pursuit of A Meaningful at the MarkMindy Solomon GallerySt (2020) and the Sunny Side Up at the UpSunny Gallery in New York City (2021). Brock’s auctions are well-received as he is ranked among the top contemporary artists today. Kador Brock lives and works in New York. ",2177

Prefab77,"Prefab77 is a group of artists who create unusually elegant street art and prints, but their approach is never simple and superficial. Beauty itself is not their final destination - behind their carefully executed and always profoundly beautiful artworks, there is always some political or anti-establishment notion. Prefab77 consider themselves storytellers and whatever they have learned about fashion, politics, music and history, they try to incorporate in their prints or murals. They are recognizable for their common motifs of beautiful female faces combined with various symbols resembling vitrages in church windows.  Prefab77 artists have different origins, which are northern England, California and New York. However, what is common for them is that they’ve grown up in major urban areas and they were influenced by similar names and events of the global pop culture. Number 77 in their name is directly referring to the year of ’77, which was a very successful year for British celebrities if we look at the history of rock and roll and music charts. In the same way, Prefab77 became very successful both in the UK and the US. The artists are isolating the most attractive parts of the popular culture and combining them with vintage headlines and articles from the newspapers while preserving a certain glam rock aesthetics. All of that is united through a unique technical approach, similar to window vitrages found in Christian iconography. Even though Prefab77's references are pop culture personalities, the way they are depicted has a sacral aura to it, making pop icons resemble their older, more traditional cousins – Christian icons. When asked to describe their work, Prefab77 say it is dark, funny, beautiful, part fantasy part social comment, fading institutions and emerging futures icons. The way they compose their art is not overly dependent on any routine procedure. They shoot or find photos and consequently draw and paint additional layers on them, using media such as acrylic colors, spraypaint, wheatpaste and different varnishes. They are familiar with both screen-print and hand-painting, playfully combining digital and analog techniques.   Prefab77 are very active artists who are living extremely busy life in between the UK and the States. In 2015, Inner State Gallery from Detroit, MI asked them to stay there for 2 weeks for the artist residence and during that time, Prefab77 have created a whole array of new hand-painted prints and woodcuts, exhibited in the same gallery after their residence was completed. Two years ago, they have participated in another outstanding exhibition, called The Outsiders, in Newcastle . This was a quite different experience for Prefab77 since they had a chance to experiment with the use of light and the photo sensitive film called Oralite, which is normally used for road signs and police cars. Oralite strongly reflects light and it gave a lot of unexpected and almost haunting glow to their artworks, something they have never seen before. At the moment, Prefab 77 own their own gallery, Electric Sheep, where they exhibit their own work as well as the work of other renown British artists.   Prefab77’s work is the personification of various values found in the global pop culture. It doesn’t matter if the artists are talking about fashion, music or politics – there is always a visible hint of luxury and elitism mixed with rebellious or vane headlines glued over their prints or murals. But only after they seduce us with their colorful and glamorous imagery, they serve us the main dish, which is their message. United Britain became Untied Britain in their hands in a smooth and delicious way.  ",2179

Paul Thek,"American artist Paul Thek is best known for his paintings, video, sculptures, and installations. Inspired by art history and contemporary culture, he created ""meat"" sculptures. The disembodied body parts the artist created from various materials were the artist's way of questioning modern society and existential anxiety. The piece that made him a household name was the renowned The Tomb—Death of a Hippie (1967). Thek's works that have inspired a generation of young and upcoming artists are today part of several international private and public collections, including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Art Museum of the Archdiocese of Cologne, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam.   Paul Thek, born in 1933 in Brooklyn, New York City, studied at Pratt Institute and the Art Students League of New York. The artist graduated from Cooper Union School of the Arts in NY. After moving to Miami, he began creating a number of paintings and drawings that are now held in several institutions. Born George Thek in 1955, he decided to refer to himself as Paul, a name he kept for the rest of his life. In Miami, Paul had his first solo exhibition at Mirrell Gallery in 1957. The artist relocated with his partner photographer Peter Hujar to New York, where they socialized with several prominent writers and artists, including Susan Sontag, Eva Hesse, Joseph Raffaele, and Gene Swenson.   When in the 1960s Thek visited Baroque Crypts in Sicily, the artist was fascinated with the body parts decorations that adorned the walls. It was the first time he saw images of limbs used like flowers around the space. The artist who appreciated the beauty in all things, saw it in a place that others found disturbing. Besides beauty, Paul had a lifelong fascination with the vulnerability of the human body and was deeply concerned about the unstoppable passage of time. In 1967 he created the legendary installation The Tomb—Death of a Hippie at the Stable Gallery in New York. On a pink ziggurat, he laid the full-size cast of his body and surrounded it with several body parts. The installation Meat Pieces or Technological Reliquaries is considered one of his most renowned works. The wax sculptures of human limbs locked inside Plexiglass vitrines pointed to the high cost of the Vietnam War. Later in his career, Paul abandoned the grotesque sculptures in favor of painting.   Paul Thek often mentioned several artists that influenced his work, including Robert Rauschenberg, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, and Jasper Johns. After his return to New York in the 1970s, the artist lost some of his fame and worked as a teacher at Cooper Union. By the 1980s, he once again began exhibiting his work internationally. In 1988 Thek passed away from complications due to AIDS. The Whitney Museum of American Art had a major retrospective of his work in 2010, entitled Paul Thek: Diver, A Retrospective.

Julio Le Parc,"Julio Le Parc is an Argentinian op and kinetic artist, known for his perceptually illusory paintings, sculptures, and installations. A significant figure in Argentinean modern art, he is a founding member of Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visual - GRAV. Le Parc was born in 1928 in Mendoza, Argentina, into a family of limited economic means. After moving with his mother to Buenos Aires, he attended the School of Fine Arts and showed growing interest in artistic avant-garde movement in Argentina. It is here that he formed GRAV, along with fellow artists Hugo Demarco, F. García Miranda, Francisco Sobrino, Horacio García Rossi, Molnar, François Morellet, Sergio Mǫyano Servanes, Jean-Pierre Yvaral, and Jöel Stein. In 1966, he received the Grand Prize for Painting at the 33rd Venice Biennale. Positing a utopian vision for art and society through his perceptually illusory paintings, sculptures, and immersive installations, Le Parc described his practice as “disturbances in the artistic system.” Working to break down the boundaries between art and the viewer through color, line, light, shadow, and movement, he wanted to ""seek, together with the public, various means of fighting off passivity, dependency or ideological conditioning, by developing reflective, comparative, analytical, creative or active capacities.” ",2183

Jimmy De Sana,"Jimmy De Sana was an American artist, best known for his presence at the punk art scene in the East Village in the 70s and 80s. His photography was often classified as anti-art. The themes De Sana chose were usually connected to the perception of the human body – his capturing of it was often described as ranging from the savagely explicit to purely symbolic. The introduction to his photo book Submission, which was self-published in 1980, was written by William S. Burroughs. Born in Detroit in 1950, De Sana grew up in Atlanta. He was first drawn to photography as a teenager, photographing his friends and acquaintances naked. After studying art at the University of Georgia, he moved to New York in 1973. There, he immediately became a fixture on the local scene that he mediated and processed with ever-present camera. He had numerous solo exhibitions, including those in Wilkinson Gallery, London; Pat Hearn Gallery, New York; Galerie Jacques de Windt, Brussels and Museum of the Twentieth Century, Vienna, Austria. He died in 1990 from AIDS related illness. Throughout his career, DeSana focused on the human body as the primary subject, in a manner ranging from ""savagely explicit to purely symbolic"". He first began experimenting with color photography in 1980. He also created a number of portraits of icons such as Kathy Acker, Kenneth Anger, Richard Hell, David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, John Giorno, Debbie Harry, John Lurie, and Patti Astor, characterized by both commercial appeal and their skilled and flamboyant punk sensibility.

3F,"Street art is a dance between love and hate. For the ones who usually have positive impressions, street art is a form of artistic expression, nothing less significant than painting or sculpture, while those who see it as an act of vandalism and destroying someone’s property tend to dislike it. However, when the themes involve love, peace and justified social critique, like in the case of 3F, also known as 3fountains, even the strongest opponents admit that he has a point, but they disagree about the way that point is made. His depictions of the beauty of the feminine form, his portraits of innocence, and bringing back the memories from childhood have won the hearts of many viewers.  Images are often more powerful than words, especially when the themes are peace and love, but also the critique of the society. For 3F, art is a way to escape from this world, to be someone that simply doesn’t exist in this world. It awakens the rebellious spirit and it gives a voice to the artist’s thoughts, allowing him to say things he couldn’t say otherwise. Banksy was a reason 3F took up street art in the first place, but it wasn’t until he saw the work of Norwegian artists Pobel and Dolk he amassed enough courage to actually go out and start painting outdoors.   There is a certain level of glamor and excitement around street art, but that’s only half of the story. Sometimes you are just worried you’re going to be arrested, and you have to work pretty early in the morning or wait for the cover of darkness when you can barely see what you’re doing. Balancing carefully between the two extremes, 3F finds it easier to work outdoors than paint on a canvas. Of course, he has to work commissions and originals so he could afford to travel and actually work in the streets. Even when he does work indoor, he prefers painting on Pine wood, stressing it and giving it the vintage look. Unfortunately, street art is only a sort of a hobby for 3F, as he has a full-time job, completely unrelated to art.   The fact that artworks aren’t permanent and they could be ‘alive’ for only a few hours gives the street art something romantic and makes it appealing to the artist. The point of the public places is to engage, so why not decorate them in a manner we find most appropriate? Well, at least, in a way so the street art could send messages different from those we’re constantly exposed when we turn on the TV, or simply look at the billboards. 3F seeks to send the messages about beauty, hope, love – as he sees them. He is represented by GraffitiStreet in Chichester, UK.  ",2190

Philippe Herard,"Philippe Herard is a versatile French artist, who became famous after creating a number of urban interventions in a Parisian neighborhood called Menilmontant.  His main goal is to upgrade and aestheticize the urban landscape of Paris - with his interesting characters, Philippe Herard writes stories and real urban poems. Tender and funny or sad and unpleasant, his installations are the mirror of our souls and the reflection of a changing society. In addition to creating his outdoors works, Herard is a painter whose pieces are exhibited in France and abroad.  Philippe Herard was born in Chalons-en-Champagne in the mid-60s and he became dedicated to visual arts already as a teenager. His earlier work was mainly acrylic on canvas but since 2009 Herard decided to make a radical change – he challenged himself and switched to creating street art. It took him some time to get used to city walls, which became his new, large-scale canvases. Nevertheless, his goal was clear - he wanted to start working on urban interventions in various Parisian neighborhoods. His current interventions are located in a triangle that goes from Oberkampf Menilmontant until Quai de Jemmapes including Belleville. Since Herard is an experienced painter, he wasn’t afraid to take an experimental approach when it comes to his street art. He uses a lot of recycled materials, in addition to charcoal and paint. His most recent works are composed of paper overlays - newspapers glued together and painted so that the text and images of the articles create a strong texture and cast shadows.   The characters that Herard paints are puppets, or perhaps clowns with expressionless faces, barely sketched.  They are placed in grotesque situations to arouse empathy,  since they symbolize the absurdity of the human condition. The artist uses the color palette already found in urban landscapes -  the apparent fragility of his subjects is emphasized by neutral colors such as beige and gray. The artist makes fun of his creatures by placing them in uncomfortable situations or by using black humor. His characters also reflect the profound solitude of the contemporary society – even when there are multiple puppets in Herard's pieces, they are identical, disturbing and depressive clones.   The work of Herard is a unique and perhaps a  little bit disturbing story about the human condition. The artist finds his own way of expression to tell stories about the modern loneliness and fear, destruction and absurdity. He develops a peculiar vocabulary of isolation and fragmentation, through his creatures which hide their faces and struggle to keep their balance. To sum up, Herard's work is representing, poetically yet painfully, our darkest fears, uncertainties, and struggles related to the ever-changing world we live in. The artist is represented by Joël Knafo Art.  ",2193

Thea Djordjadze,"Creating installations of sculptural objects, Thea Djordjadze creates works that are placed so as to depend on each other and on space of their installation. Combining common sculptural materials, as wood or plaster with the household objects like foam and linoleum, she finds her inspiration in modernist architecture and design. Her geometric constructions convey a certain tension between materials and forms. The linoleum floor covering, typical for the kitchens from the early 20th century somewhat reveals the influences of growing up in former communist Georgia. The form and layout of her works often mimic the exhibition furniture, including vitrines and plinths.   Djordjadze was born in Tbilisi, Georgia. She started her studies at the Academy of Arts in Tbilisi, but the school was closed due to the civil war. She left the country and entered the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, but after one year, she moved at the Kustakademie in Dusseldorf. Her work has been exhibited in numerous solo and group shows, of which is the Georgian Pavilion at the 2013 Venice Biennale and the 5th Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art in 2008. From 1999 Djordjadze was a member of the artist group hobbypopMUSEUM which was using the old postal building in Dusseldorf for their activities and exhibitions. They printed several catalogues and were invited to show in San Francisco. She left the group in 2003, even they are still active.    Creating hybrid compositions that respond to the modernist aesthetics, Djordjadze uses the materials as ceramic, wood, glass conjoined with different fabrics, sponge or soap, indicating the realm of feminine domesticity. Assembled by the intuition, these pieces collide with strict architectural forms. The interesting characteristic of her work is the titles that always refer to popular culture, films, literature. She often invites the viewer to participate in some kind of research in which is included the transformation and installation of the objects. As Sagas Sa is a perfect example of her sculptural micro-universe – a combination of some old museum’s vitrine and strange object from the 70’s sci-fi classic.    Djordjedze spends time in the space she exhibits, absorbing the character and energy that will help her to transform her sculptural works into an installation. Finding the inspiration in the material and atmospheric qualities of the room, she makes the artworks that unnoticed infiltrate our reading and understanding of it. She shifts the perspective on the space, provoking the viewer to question the use of the setting. Producing the new formal structures with surprising potential, Djordjadze masterfully extends the language of the sculpture.   ",2197

Bisser,"Bisser is a young Belgian street artist whose pieces represent mainly stylized, cartoonish human figures. Unlike many other street artists, Bisser is a formally trained painter and animator, focused on introducing refreshing 3D elements into his figures and letters. He became publicly known after he was chosen as one of the top three artists at Bloop Festival in Ibiza, Spain. In addition to his street art, Bisser is also dedicated to indoor pieces created on canvas, such as drawings.  Bisser is a 24-year-old Belgian artist from Leuven, who decided to transfer to Ghent to study animation. While he was still a child, his older brother, who was into comic books (Kid Paddle), was his great inspiration and Bisser wanted to grow up to be just like him. However, comic books weren’t his only inspiration, he was also quite impressed by cartoons, such as The Simpsons. Later on, his older brother began painting graffiti and Bisser immediately followed him. He learned how to use spray paints and started creating his first illegal pieces on public buildings. When it comes to his specific style, he has learned a lot about various letterforms thanks to a French magazine dedicated to graffiti. Bisser was carefully studying the pieces presented in this magazine and his letters were becoming better and bolder. He also started doing more 3D work and abstract paintings which evolved in 3D graffiti.   The artist’s pseudonym aka the word Bisser comes from the verb bissen, which means to resit your year at school. He chose this name during his first year at animation school. The name wasn't chosen by accident, however, Bisser was able to convert this classroom misfortune into a great opportunity. While Bisser was attending the secondary school, he got a brilliant idea to make an animation for his final project, which should represent 3D graffiti lines moving in the rhythm of the music, just like visual on raves. He became seriously interested in such animation projects and that is why he started to study film. His animation projects are available at his Vimeo channel.    Bisser's characters are extremely appealing, yet very hard to categorize and define. While a lot of his murals and drawings represent stylized, comic-style human figures, his creativity doesn't end there. Bisser also invents various objects with human faces or animals with a human demeanor, such as birds or fish. What is common for all of his pieces is the fact that they are impeccably placed, in the perfect accordance with their surroundings. For example, his mural representing a trapped bird is cleverly positioned on a wall of a tall building, and the net which trapped the bird looks like it was spread from a nearby window. When it comes to his paper works, such as drawings, they are equally creative since the artist often represents some unusual creatures or situations.   For Bisser, it’s hard to explain how he has found his own, specific style. Everything started from a simple desire to draw something totally different but progressed into a successful street art style. Despite his young age, Bisser has already participated in numerous group shows and festivals in Belgium and Brazil. So far, he has done two print releases, one with GraffitiStreet and another one with Under the Bridge gallery in NY, which were really successful and sold out.  ",2200

Her career, following the conceptual exit from Surrealism, was a turbulent one - her earlier paintings were heavily representational, favoring strong line, shading and linear perspective while her mature paintings, like the aforementioned Insomnias, were displaying overriding preoccupations with luminous color and energy with only the vaguest hints of figures. [caption id=""attachment_386028"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""855""] Dorothea Tanning - Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, 1943 - Image via pinterest.com[/caption]  Dorothea Tanning was born and raised in Galesburg, Illinois. In 1926, she attended Galesburg public schools and skipped two grades, a decision which led to a lifelong weakness in arithmetics. After attending Knox College for two years, Tanning moved to Chicago in 1930 and then to New York in 1935. There she supported herself as a commercial artist[2] while pursuing her own artistic expressions and style - it was then that she discovered Surrealism at the Museum of Modern Art’s seminal 1936 exhibition titled as Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism. After an eight-year relationship, she was married briefly to the writer Homer Shannon whom she met just before the start of the World War II. Impressed by her creativity and talent in illustrating fashion advertisements, the art director at Macy’s department store introduced her to the gallery owner Julien Levy who immediately offered to show her work. This truly opened the door for young Tanning who quickly became a hot topic within the art scene of the United States.  Dorothea Tanning, who was heavily influenced by Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray and Max Ernst, to whom she was married, turned increasingly to experimental styles as her career progressed, advancing from her initial painterly experimentation to her soft cloth sculptures and installations. However, it should be noted that she never fully abandoned the surrealistic aesthetic despite often venturing far from the movement's fundamental concepts. Furthermore, despite the often association to his work, Tanning was not an acolyte or imitator of Ernst. Her own vivid, dreamlike images are highly distinctive, although a bit more gothic than surreal. Over the course of the 1950s, Tanning's painting evolved, becoming less explicit and more suggestive. By the late 1960s, Tanning’s works Dorothea were almost completely abstract, yet always suggestive of the female form[3]. The artistic couple lived in Paris and later Provence until Ernst's death in 1976, after which Tanning returned to New York. She continued to create studio art in the 1980s, then turned her attention to her writing and poetry in the 1990s and 2000s, working and publishing until the end of her life. Tanning died on January 31, 2012, in her Manhattan home.   When the artist Dorothea Tanning died at the age of 101, the US art scene felt a deep earthquake strike like never before. Suddenly, the last of the major female Surrealistic figures was gone and the scene lost what may very well be the most experimental artist of all the women in the 20th-century world of art. Between her talent and the long marriage with the great surrealist Max Ernst, Tanning was an extremely intriguing artist who managed to develop her craft to astonishing heights despite the fact she had to overcome many obstacles during her life - many of which were discussed in her autobiography Birthday (1986).

Henri Privat-Livemont,"Art Nouveau was an artistic movement that marked the end of 19th century and welcomed modernism as a dominant direction in creation. Even though it lasted for no more than 15 years, some great artists, including Henri Privat-Livemont, found their most suiting visual language right during those years. Known as one of the best post-Mucha Art Nouveau stylists, Privat-Livemont reached fame with his unique posters, often made for the needs of casinos and theaters. He decorated the Theatre Francais and the Hotel de Ville from 1883 to 1889, and was very versatile as an artist, working as a painter and even successfully applying the technique of sgraffito.  Cleary influenced by Alphonse Mucha, it’s possible that the two of them actually met as they were both in Paris between 1887 and 1889. Despite that influence, there is a general consensus in categorizing Privat-Livemont’s style as Art Nouveau, thus joining him with the other famous artists like Aubrey Beardsley, Koloman Moser, Eugene Grasset, and George de Feure. His artworks were included in Les maîtres de l'affiche – The Masters of Poster, which was a famous collection of French and international posters made between 1890 and 1990, published in smaller size by Jules Chéret and Chaix. The publication was well received and was published from 1895 to 1900, with four new posters being printed monthly. The artist’s most famous piece was Absinthe Robette, an exceptionally fascinating poster still interesting to the art collectors and enthusiasts around the world. It depicted beautiful naked lady holding a glass of absinthe. The piece was extremely peculiar, offering different interpretations in the minds of viewers.   Privat-Livemont was born in Schaerbeek in Belgium and studied at the Academy of Saint-Josse. After studies, he spent several years in Paris, decorating the Town Hall. While he was in the capital of France, he worked at the studios of Lemaire, Lavastre & Duvignaud, and was a part of the team that designed the décor for the Hotel de Ville and Theater Francais. His interest in décor was great, and he continued to work on it after returning to Belgium. The less-known facts about him tell the story of a very diverse artist, who, other than creating posters and designing the décor, also worked as a painter and a photographer. In fact, his understanding of photography served as a basis for the genesis of feminine beauty in Art Nouveau and inspired many, including the great Helmut Newton. Privat-Livemont also mastered the technique of sgraffito, decorating facades and many local schools in Brussels. ",2206

Gabriele Dal Dosso,"Gabriele Dal Dosso is an Italian artist-inventor and an expert in creating three-dimensional forms. He has managed to transform the complex form of cube into the meditative practice of art, inspired by the Möbius strip structure. Dal Dosso’s art is an infinite play of dichotomies created by the surprisingly malleable three-dimensional form of cube. His most famous series of artworks is called Cubo di Gabo and it consists of diverse prototypes, varying in their size, color, and structure.  Gabriele Dal Dosso was born in Italy in 1978. He recalls that his fascination with the Möbius strip started a long time ago when his childhood friend lent him a science fiction novel, in which he found the definition of the one-sided surface. Young Dal Dosso was really excited for having found such a mysterious object that he has been searching for years in length and breadth, in shops and libraries. Inspired by this discovery, Dal Dosso started working on his best known Cubo di Gabo series, which represents the transformation of a philosophical idea into a tangible object. The same evening I had the first version, four months later came the final one, says the artist about his project.   The Cubo di Gabo series is based on the Möbius strip proportions and sections which can be transformed into a cube with an appropriate range and order of movements. This gives rise to the peculiarity that prompted the artist to embark on this unusual artistic journey, in between geometry and philosophy. From a logical point of view, when I hold this cube I find myself in it, claims the artist. He already has some ideas for his future performances and projects which might feature Cubo di Gabo as an object, or perhaps a site, ideal for meditation on different scales, from macro to micro. Because of this, the artist defines his cubes as philosophical toys, as well as dynamic sculptures. The artist has been an active exhibitor since 2015 and so far he had two solo and two group shows, in Paris and Milano, with Molin Corvo Gallery. We hope to see more of his unique geometrical projects exhibited not only in Europe but also worldwide.   Each Cubo di Gabo is a geometric translation of the famous verses from William Blake, says Dal Dosso, having in mind the opening of Blake’s famous poem Auguries of Innocence . Dal Dosso’s deceivingly simple work, which relies on the purity of black and whites forms with hints of red, represents the night, the day, and the life itself with all of its diversities.Cubo di Gabo represents a certain geometric alchemy, a particular case of squaring the circle and experiencing the allure of unknown. The artist is represented by Molin Corvo Gallery.  ",2215

Celia Philo,"Every once in a while comes a moment of pure inspiration, the endless creativity that will leave an impact on the entire world. One of those magical moments occurred in 1973, when Celia Philo, a graphic designer, worked together with a famous photographer Brian Duffy, creating, in the end, something that will remain written in the history of both art and music. That was the birth of the omnipresent cover for David Bowie’s Aladdin Sane, an album that skyrocketed Bowie to the No. 1 in the United Kingdom and eventually made its place on the prestigious Rolling Stone list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2012), sitting strongly at position #279. After its release in 1973, the cover had a powerful influence on the establishment and fast spread of the glam and punk rock fashion that completely took over London. In charge of directing the shoot for the cover design, Philo had a major role in the creation of one of the most famous and iconic album images of all times.    Already (relatively) known prior to the Aladdin Sane, Bowie had amassed his followers. However, it was this particular album that put him on the main stage, and the flash sign over his face that has played its part in creating a specific image that Bowie retained until his premature death in early 2016. Celia Philo studied graphic design at Maidstone College of Art in the 1960’s, the same time David Hockney was also there teaching fine art. After studies, she returned to London, where she married and did a lot of various design commissions throughout her 20’s. She also worked for Pirelli calendars, and that turned out to be a key thing in her relationship with Brian Duffy. Introduced to the photographer by someone who had known that the both of them had worked o Pirelli’s projects, Philo quickly realized that they could work together. The feeling was mutual, and Duffy asked her if she’d be interested in joining his in setting up Duffy Design Concepts, a small company that consisted of only the two of them and an assistant. For Bowie’s cover image, the duo was joined by Pierre La Roche, a French make-up artist chosen by the Duffy himself for the shoot. The exact origin of the Flash is still engulfed in mystery, and there are still a lot of theories about how it came to be. However, Philo was finally able to shed a little light on the topic, stating that it was a fruit of their work as a team. They knew that Bowie had already worn costumes with a lightning flash on them, and Pierre said that it would be a good idea if they put the flash over the musician’s face. Philo agreed, Dufy took the pictures, and the rest is a part of history. ",2218

Richard Zu Ming Ho,"Creating traditional images inwrought with the touch of romantic Impressionism, Richard Zu Ming Ho strives to bring spiritual quality through the intimacy of his sophisticated characters. His lyrical style paints poems and divine stories on the canvases, deeply influenced by French masters like Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, as well as American painters John Singer Sargent and James Whistler. His propensity towards western visual language brought him unwanted attention of the Mao’s Communist Party that tried to break his spirit by forcing him to hard labor in camp.  Zu Ming Ho was born in 1949, in a family that had already produced several well-known artists. His earliest artistic affinities were satisfied by taking classes in drawing, watercolor, calligraphy and figurative painting in “Western style” with the wide range of themes and motifs. As a member of the famous Yunnan School, his aim was to educate the Chinese people about western innovations through traditional themes. But his wishes were thwarted when the communist regime sent him to do forced labor where lived for a ten years keeping his artistic dream alive by memorizing images and patiently waiting for the moment of liberation. With the end of Cultural Revolution, the artist finally graduated from the Shanghai Drama Institute of Fine Arts, majoring in oil painting. He started to exhibit his work throughout his country and in 1987 he had a chance to immigrate to the United Stated following an acceptance to study at an American university. His first international exhibition was held in Los Angeles.   Finally freeing his talent, Ho's paintings became more opulent with meaning and elegance. Combining sophisticated approach with the vivid colors, his works glorify the beauty of the human body and the intimate relationship with nature and the universe. The artist conveys the essence of the Chinese tradition using the intertwined lines, delicate tones of colors, rich textures, and elongated figures of his characters. The importance of his contribution to the Chinese contemporary art is confirmed by his numerous recognitions. The artist was honored as a member of the Chinese Art Association and was named vice chancellor of National Jia Zhou Institute of painting.  ",2220

Keiichi Tanaami,"Keiichi Tanaami is one of the most important artists of postwar Japan and a prolific creator who has been active since the 1960s as a graphic designer, illustrator, and video artist. His imagery is crowded with various war motifs, such as American bombers, fleeing masses, and searchlights. His paintings and sculptures blend together the elements of pop art with the memories from his childhood that don’t include only World War II scenes, but also hallucinatory experiences and high fevers. At the same time, Tanaami’s works have a certain connection with the religious practices of Asia and Japanese history and culture.  Keiichi Tanaami was born in the mid-30s in Tokyo and he was only 9 years old when Tokyo was bombed during the World War II in 1945. My dreams were a vortex of fear and anxiety, anger and resignation, recalls Tanaami. He was into visual arts from his early childhood and during his high schools days he started practicing drawing together with the famous cartoonish Kazushi Hara. However, after Hara has suddenly died, Tanaami got involved with the pioneering disciplines of early manga and graphic novel art which eventually led to his career of a professional artist at Musashino University. He was very successful and talented and in 1958 he was awarded the Special Selection at an exhibition held by the Japanese illustration masters. After graduation, Keiichi Tanaami started working in an advertising agency, but due to the popularity of his works and numberless private commission, he had to quit this job. In the second part of the ‘60s, he got dedicated to innovative forms of creation, such as making video pieces.   During the 1960s, the Sogetsu Center in Akasaka became the gathering point of many experimental, avant-garde artists such as Yoko Ono and Nam June Paik. The Sogetsu center was also playing new experimental films and videos from America. Around that time, Keiichi Tanaami heard about the Sogetsu Animation Festival held in 1965 and decided to make an animation for it, called Marionettes in Masks. During the festival, he learned more the works of Andy Warhol as well as the phenomena of American consumerism along with psychedelic culture. He started producing kitschy, colorful illustrations and designs which resonated well with the current artistic tendencies and they were praised in both Japan and the United States. Some of his most famous pieces from this period are NO MORE WAR poster from 1968 and album covers for bands such as The Monkees and Jefferson Airplane. Thanks to these artworks, Tanaami managed to introduce the psychedelic trends to Japan. The same goes for his series of erotic paintings portraying Hollywood actresses, which show the artist’s attitude related to the American contemporary world.   In the mid-70s, Tanaami became the director of the Japanese version of Playboy Magazine and around the same time, he traveled to New York to visit Playboy’s headquarters. For the occasion, he also went to see Andy Warhol’s Factory. When it comes to Tanaami’s personal style from the 1970s and 80s, he was producing both film and print-based works, which were highly provocative. His movies were well-received and they appeared many short film festivals, such as the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in Germany, the New York Film Festival and the Ottawa International Animation Festival in 1976. Unfortunately, in 1981, Tanaami suffered a pulmonary edema which nearly killed him. During the ‘80s and ‘90s, the majority of his works revolved around the theme of life and death, based on his personal experiences and traumas. In 1999, a major retrospective of Tanaami’s works was opened at Gallery 360° in Tokyo and the exhibition was a great success amongst youth. Encouraged by this achievement, Tanaami started presenting his new works in the field of fine art, such as painting and sculpture. In these works, he still relies on his personal memories related to war, illnesses, and psychedelic motifs. During the 2000s, Keiichi Tanaami continued participating in various film festivals, such as the Stuttgart Festival of Animation Film in Germany, the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France, the Los Angeles Animation Festival and Japanese film screening at the MoMA in New York, in 2013.   Keiichi Tanaami's innovative projects are much more than an unusual mix of Eastern and Western traditions. Tanaami also introduces a lot of personal elements to his works, making this mix appear powerful and bizarre at times, in line with the psychedelic tradition and surrealism. Since 2006, the presence of Tanaami's works on the worldwide exhibition scene go stronger and he obtained a lot of international acclaim at galleries and museums across the world. His new works in the sector of film and animations are still regularly screened at various movie festivals.  ",2223
Eric Foenander,"Artists are passionate about their work. There is no doubt about it. So many emotions are poured into the creative process, and the results are often astonishing. Eric Foenander, also known as TheTownJeweller, Efoe and Easy E, is a Singaporean contemporary artist who has managed to develop another passion besides art – music. Known widely for his illustrations and commercial graphic designs, he is also quite known for the Good Times, the Singapore-based party venues, famous for their phenomenal music, but also for their amazing artworks.  Foenander is very versatile and original, creating sculptures, oil and acrylic paintings, digital artworks, apparel designs, and murals. Speaking of influences, James Jean is his favorite illustrator, Parra is the designer to seek out, and the artist even finds some inspiration in film-making, especially in the visually rich work of Michell Gondry and Guillermo Del Toro. He usually works on a project until something else pops up or he might just get a dream about the next piece. There is no reason to bother himself with the problems that may occur while working, as the solution will always be found – sometimes the answer will be discovered immediately, sometimes it will take some time before the results get finally materialized over numerous nights of just chatting with people and getting their opinions. Among his pieces, several stand out. One of them is Future Nostalgia (Singapore), created in 2011, which represents a probing narrative on the images we draw on when considering the themes of identity and legacy. Another one is actually a collaboration piece with Mojoko, titled No One Can Save Us (2012). Easily recognizable even from a far away, the sculpture depicts a melting Superman. Predicting not so happy ending, the sculpture addresses the issue of global warming, stating that if a God-like creature such as Superman can’t deal with it, how can we, ordinary humans? The piece was part of the exhibition: The Singapore Show: Future Proof, and was exhibited in front of Singapore Art Museum.    Born in Singapore, Foenander lived there until he was 14, moved to Adelaide in Australia before eventually returning home a decade later. He’s a very busy man, ‘trapped’ between never-ending commercial and personal work. Having previously worked as an art director at Ogilvy & Mather and the leading creative for Bedsty, Foenander is now one the most wanted artists in Singapore and the entire region as well.  However, besides art, he also has a passion for music, the accent being on the rap and hip-hop genres. For the past eight years, he drew an inspirational poster each month, promoting the parties organized by the Good Times.  ",2224
Srihadi Soedarsono,"Widely recognized one of the most eminent representatives of Indonesian art, Srihadi Soedarsono is best known for his expressionistic interpretations of vast landscapes, glorious horizons and Javanese and Balinese dancers.

His work has been included in many exhibitions throughout Southeast Asia and beyond.  Born in 1931, in Surakarta, a city on the Indonesian island of Java, Srihadi Soedarsono was introduced to art by his grandfather when he was only five. Aged fifteen, the artist participated in a project of creating posters for the Indonesian anti-colonial movement against the Dutch occupation of Yogyakarta, and three years later, he illustrated the Kaliurang peace negotiations that would signify Indonesian independence. The artist soon gained a reputation as a pro-western artist who took an active position that allowed him to question and analyze the authorities. He graduated from the University of Indonesia at Bandung in 1958 and obtained his MA from Ohio State University in 1962. Additionally, he utilized his education at the Bandung Institute of Technology and Jakarta Art Institute where he taught as a lecturer.    Prominent painting maestro, Srihadi Soedarsono has created numerous works inspired by nature and all the beauties of his native country. His landscapes often depict Indonesia's spectacular sites such as Mount Merapi, an active stratovolcano and Borobudur, a famous Buddhist temple, dating from the 8th and 9th centuries. Using expressive brushstrokes and intense colors, he reduces scenery to its simplest form with the horizon stretching into infinity. Visually impactful paintings reflect the dynamic and effective use of colors that capture the spirituality of depicted place, inviting deep reflection and evoking a contemplative state. One of his most famous series inspired by landscapes is entitled Cosmic Horizons.    Along with his landscapes, Soedarsono often paints images of traditional Javanese and Balinese dancers. He has a unique ability to capture poignant moments of dancers unaware, using colors to evoke a sense of freedom, tranquility and happiness. One of his favorite subject matter, Soedarsono’s dancers are characterized by harmony, beauty, balance, and elegance. They are often depicted in various poses - during the preparation of the dance, when they are putting on their costumes or while dancing. No matter what, the artist always maintains to capture all their grace and the enthusiastic expression of their bodies and faces.

Eyvind Earle,"Eyvind Earle, an American illustrator and author, is a true master of contemplative landscape paintings. In nature when I look I see trees, some of them are such that they thrill me with their perfection and their sweeping lines and certain mood they seem to have. In every tree I feel as though I could see the soul of that tree, said Earle who is best known for his contribution to the background illustration and styling of Disney animations, mainly throughout the 1950s. The most prestigious institutions such as Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Rahr-West Art Museum, Phoenix Art Museum and Arizona State University Museum have Earle's work in their permanent collections and he is also known for his tremendously successful solo exhibitions across the globe.  Eyvind Earle was born in New York City in 1916. Only two years later, his family decided to move to the West Coast - namely to Hollywood. Young Eyvind started painting when he was just 10 years old. Around the same time, his father challenged him to either read books or paint every day and a brave young Eyvind exceeded his father’s expectations when he managed to do both. Earle was a talented painter from the very beginning and he had his first solo exhibition in France when he was only 14. When it comes to his first New York City exhibition, it was held at the Charles Morgan Galleries in 1937. Only two years later, in 1939, the Metropolitan Museum decided to purchase one of Earle’s works for its permanent collection, which was an unbelievable success for a young artist, having in mind the reputation of this prestigious museum. His another great achievement has happened in the 1940s when he designed roughly 800 Christmas cards for the American Artist Group. Earle’s early work was mainly straightforward realistic, but by the age of 21, the painter has become influenced by the works of many contemporary masters such as Van Gogh, Cézanne and Georgia O’Keeffe and he developed his very own style, which is closest to Magic Realism.   In 1951, Earle joined Walt Disney studios, initially as an assistant of background painting. One of the first projects he received credit for was the experimental background in the Goofy short animation, called For Whom the Bulls Toll. Earle’s second project, from 1953, entitled Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom was already a masterpiece which received an Academy Award as well as Cannes Film Festival Award. Needless to say, Disney was more than satisfied with Earle’s work and kept him very busy for the following ten years. Earle’s important task included painting the settings for various famous tales such as Peter Pan, Working for Peanuts, Pigs is Pigs, Paul Bunyan and Lady and the Tramp. Earle was the main artist responsible for the detailed, meticulous styling of background and its color palette. One of his universally acclaimed animated movies was Sleeping Beauty from 1959, which is also considered the very pinnacle of Earle’s career. Thanks to Earle’s wild imagination and use of magic realism techniques, Sleeping Beauty movie became known for its lush, complex medieval look. The artist has also created the dioramas for Sleeping Beauty’s Castle which can be seen at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Another interesting fact related to this particular animated movie is that it served as the inspiration for the graphics of Sony's first computer-generated animation from 2006, called Open Season. Earle’s work wasn’t featured only in Disney pieces, but also on television. For example, his 18-minute animation based on the story of the Nativity appeared on TV under the name The Story of Christmas, 1963. This successful piece even became digitally remastered in 1997. In addition to Earle’s career in animation, it is important to mention that the artist was an accomplished book illustrator, who designed many covers for magazine publications, as well as a commercial video artist, who produced several TV commercials.   In the mid-sixties, after a few decades of successful career, Earle has decided to return to his initial passion, which was a full-time painting. He started producing various watercolors and oil works, as well as sculptures, drawings, scratchboards, and beautiful limited-edition serigraphs. Many of his works from the 60s were not showcased during his lifetime, even though he kept working diligently until the very end of his life. One thing which is surely true for Eyvind Earle is that he had a very different, totally original vision when it comes to landscape. It is hard to replicate his dream-like style, which perhaps resembles a little bit some of the backgrounds found in the imaginative pieces of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, who is, in a way, Japanese counterpart of Disney. Earle’s personal style merges seemingly incongruent aspects into a powerfully distinctive style which is mysterious, moody, warm and nostalgic, all at once. He skillfully captured the poignant simplicity of American countrysides and his landscapes are truly remarkable for their fairytale representation of distances, landmasses, and even weather. For 70 years, Earle said around the end of his life, I’ve painted paintings, and I’m constantly and everlastingly overwhelmed at the stupendous infinity of Nature. Eyvind Earle died on July 20, 2000, at the age of 84 and his entire oeuvre is now owned by Eyvind Earle Publishing LLC, under the specific instructions of the late artist.   Earle’s imaginative pieces which became known across the globe thanks to Disney won many prestigious awards. In 1998, the artist won the Windson McCay Award at the 26th Annie Awards, which is a special prize given for lifetime achievements in the sector of animation. In 2015, at a D23 Expo, which is a bi-annual event in Anaheim, California that celebrates the magic, wonder, and adventure of Disney, Earle was announced a Disney Legend. His daughter, Kristin Thompson, accepted this great honor on her late father's behalf. The artist’s legacy known as Eyvind Earle Publishing LLC will continue to promote and introducing his new, still unknown serigraphs and books through galleries and museums worldwide. Earle’s posthumous limited edition serigraph series will be printed based on the oil paintings currently in the collection of Joan Earle and others. Also, the artist’s Christmas cards, which include more than 800 designs have sold more than 300 million copies through American Artist Group and they are still popular and can be found and purchased through various online channels. Eyvind Early was strongly appreciated by the major publications such as Time, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The New York World-Telegram, and The New York Sun, which contributed to his popularity and recognition.   The term Magic Realism perfectly captures the essence Earle’s style - the colors and mood of his artworks have the amazing ability to transport the viewers to a wide-range of magical scenes. The artist’s impeccable sense of lighting and composition is beautifully blended with his nostalgic tales of fantasy and children’s fiction. Whatever beauty is, I feel it, and as long as I can I shall try to find more and more beauty, and to put it down so that others can see what I have seen, said Earle on his main motivation behind the creative processes. His poetic artworks and his specific, dream-like graphic styling continue to inspire new generations of creators, serigraph enthusiasts, and animators, who have Disney’s or perhaps Hayao Miyazaki’s style as their departure point. Even some of the newer Disney’s features, such as Pocahontas from 1995 and Frozen from 2013, are considered influenced by the original style of Earle, introduced to Disney Studios back to the golden era of the 50s.

G.A. Dandekar,"Internationally renowned for raising awareness of his country's culture and heritage, G. A. Dandekar is a talented painter from India who has been working tirelessly at breaking cultural barriers between Asia's countries, as well as introducing them to the lands of the West. G.A. Dandekar's work is a reflection of the kindness and dynamics India's people go through every day and the vibrancy this painter is so famed for make his pieces instantly appealing to both a layman, an average viewer or an expert, regardless of the fact if you've been previously introduced to the ways and the pace of India's life.  Growing up as a farmer's son, G. A. Dandekar had an interesting childhood set in such idyllic surroundings that his inner harmony was manifested through a fascination and preoccupation with nature. He spent his early years in his homeland in the foothills of Sahyadri, otherwise known as the Western Ghats of India (a famous UNESCO World Heritage Site) and the experiences gathered here can easily be seen in both Dandekar's early and mature artwork - this environment especially helped form the style of Dandekar’s early landscape paintings. After his family realized he had both massive artistic potential and a strong drive for painting, G. A. Dandekar was sent to Mumbai where he joined an art school to pursue his love of painting. After he graduated with flying colors, G. A. Dandekar decided it was the right time to take an inspiration journey throughout his country, hoping that travels would be enough to fuel his inner desires to paint. These trips actually changed him for good as he found most beauty and appreciation not in India's nature but in her people - the colorful celebrations, village life and interactions of his countryman left G. A. Dandekar speechless and from that point onward, he would try to replicate these influences on canvas in his own unique way. After he became famous for his depictions of his country's different aspects, G. A. Dandekar was often asked where did he find his inspirations and influences - he would often give thanks to his childhood and nature, but would also name the likes of Picasso, Matisse, Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Goggin and the Indian masters of the past as they've all had a massive role to play in shaping Dandekar's aesthetics. As was said before, Dandekar praises his style for being simultaneously both approachable to laymen and experts as it manages to present India's style of life to anyone who is interested into finding out more than they know, regardless of how much art experience they have behind them. G. A. Dandekar is also highly regarded for his theoretical contributions to the India's art scene - with the statement like If simplifications and distortions are considered as mathematical or methodical steps in the creative process achieving simplicity can be considered as metaphysical one, you can be rest assured that this artist knows what he's doing.   G. A. Dandekar has exhibited extensively throughout South and East Asia, with many solo and group shows proving to be a massive hit with the local audience, but his work can also be found in many private collections worldwide. He also appeared on a few television shows in which he sponsored art programs and has been commissioned by several large organizations to design their programs. This only comes to show how influential and important G. A. Dandekar is for art in Asia, especially his own country - here's an artist who proudly represents his heritage and presents it to the rest of the world, introducing India's culture to the audience who would never be in a position to meet the everyday life of one of the largest countries in the world.

He Neng,"Renowned for his mystical motifs and fascinating control over colors and composition, He Neng is a Chinese artist who has been present and active on his country's art scene for decades. Ever since he made the decisive move to this university, Neng was automatically associated with the Yunnan Art School and is considered to be one of the founding fathers behind this prestigious institution. As this artist is often identified with his school, it is often said that He Neng encapsulates the Yunnan style in his paintings, skilfully balancing between traditional and modern Chinese artistic motifs and elements. No matter what the particular subject of the piece is, He Neng always reflects China’s mythical past in one way or another.  During the year of 1942, He Neng was born in a southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, a region renowned for its cuisine and endangered giant pandas. Ever since he was a small toddler, He Nang was showing artistic tendencies and stories about creative potential and promise soon started to surround the young boy. After he graduating from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts in the year of 1965, He Neng was drafted and stationed in the city of Kunming, the modern capital town of China’s southern Yunnan province - here, the aspiring artist was in charge of producing political propaganda during the years of Mao’s Cultural Revolution that was taking place during the mid 1960s. Although these kinds of work were not something He Neng desired to do, it was still a lot better and safer than other vacations amidst the Chinese army, plus the experiences he gathered whilst producing political propaganda actually served the artist good in a long term. Slowly but surely, He Neng started to build a reputation for himself and soon his works were desired by many interested viewers - he went on to win prizes for his illustrations and ultimately, he joined the faculty of the Yunnan Art Institute where he is still serving as a professor to this very day. The Yunnan Art Institute started to be a lot more respected and influential as Neng joined their program - his works almost single-handedly resulted in a wider recognition of the Yunnan School. Neng seemed to be a perfect fit with the faculty that hired him as the style in his paintings was a fascinating mixture of traditional and modern Chinese elements - something that Yunnan Art School held in high regard. He has also displayed a strong control over coloring as he often uses a rich color technique that also became a particular hallmark of the Yunnan School. Neng is also one of the artists that believe improvisation, impulsivness and expression are all good aspects when making art, explaining it this way: I let the brush strokes follow the fluctuation of my thought and emotion; my result is unexpected. I strain to emancipate myself from the confines of the tangible world.   It's fascinating that He Neng was able to stick to his creative principals and artistic rules for decades, never showing any signs of second thoughts or doubts in his own work. This is, of course, very much appreciated by the audience, clearly displayed by the fact He Neng held over 100 exhibitions around his country and the rest of Asia, never failing to attract massive numbers of viewers to his shows. Combine that with the fact he was always consistent, artistically brilliant and conceptually original, and you will easily see why He Neng is considered by many to be one of the most esteemed Chinese contemporary artists in recent history. Thanks to He Neng's life work, both himself and Yunnan Art School will surely be held in high regard for years to come.  ",2228
Jiang Li,"Blending influences from the East and West, the old and new, Jiang Li is a Chinese artist who creates a rich visual tapestry that successfully combines the traditions of Asia with techniques of contemporary expression. Emerging from China’s Cultural Revolution and coming from Yunnan School, where he studied under Ting Shao Kuang, one of the school’s founders, Li is a part of the second wave of Yunnan artists. He manages to merge influences of his Chinese cultural heritage with Neolithic images, designs originating in Bronze Age, but also post-Han literature and the philosophy of Taoism. The imagery and colors are also inspired by the Buddhist cave paintings of the Silk Road as well as the setting of the Yunnan Province’s verdant jungle and its exotic tribal inhabitants. Trough his paintings, Li is showing a body of work whose creation springs from flesh interest and deeply rooted attachments. His original works have been reproduced and published in various media, including posters, serigraphs, ceramic, woodblock, bronze, and of course, books. Galleries throughout Asia, South America, Canada and the USA have shown his pieces.  He emerged from the Chinese Cultural Revolution but eventually moved to the United States of America (in 1989), seeking full and untainted artistic freedom. Among others, Li came from the Yunnan School, and all of them shared and used the rubble of the Cultural Revolution as a basis for their improvement, and they were a fresh breeze in the art world. Captivating both east and west, they have managed to create a new synthesis of international art trends and Chinese resources. Speaking of Li, his work can be described as a tribute to and an exaltation of the human spirit. His paintings are songs of life, singing in the universal language of art, deeply immersed in passion, pulse, and power. The images as the lyrics and lines as the music, the theme itself is the universality of all mankind. An aesthetic testimony to the affirmation of the human presence, Li’s paintings are exultations of the human spirit and man’s quest for alignment with universal law. He has also worked as a graphic designer and artist for a book publishing company, winning the first prize in a national competition in 1985.   ",2229
Jeff Gillette,"Childhood idols and memories in the work of Jeff Gillette  seems to represent the milestone of experimentation and articulation of the artist's social and political standpoints. The staggering boldness and irony are the most important tools the artist uses to settle his almost black humor world view. The very message that Gillette is eager to send is embedded in the imaginative and playful process respectively on the edges of reality and illusion. The satirical narratives he produces suggest the high level of awareness of not purely political, rather of economic, social, geographical context.  Jeff Gillette was born in 1959, in Detroit. As a child, at his home, he was exposed to the TV show The Wonderful World of Disney and adorned it. After facing the amusement park in the Orange County in 1978 he was extremely disappointed with the vanity of the sight and since then became somehow dazzled with the Disney iconography. The art school in Detroit was challenging, yet Gillette decided to join Peace Corps in Nepal. During that time the artist was faced with nearby Calcutta's shantytowns in his spare time. The return to the homeland was marked by a move to Orange County in 1993 when a teaching position at Foothill High School in Tustin appeared where he still teaches art today. From 2012 onwards he traveled and visited numerous favelas, barrios, bastis and shantytowns, experienced urban blight and incorporated that into his works.   The enchantment with Disney came as a natural extension of Gillette’s initial interest in Pop Art. First, it was Mickey Mouse that draws the artist attention primarily because of his simple, yet likable and simple features. Still, steady school job provided him with enough time for further development of ideas. Since Mickey is an iconic figure and somehow embodies Disney spirit, it is no wonder that Gillette produced a number of paintings with him alone. Second best is Minnie Mouse and from time to time other characters like Donald Duck, Cinderella or even sporadically ones.   Although, facing extreme poverty is always defeating and unpleasant experience, Gillette was fascinated with the poetical potency of seen sights. The sharpness of space, color, form, and texture, constitute some kind of strange visual spectacle. The vast garbage and filth landscapes seem to suggest existential urge as well as the astonishing possibility of human adaptation. Those initial impressions from the 80’s apparently had an immense effect on Gillette and kind of became attached to such an imagery, so those visits became frequent and led him forward into thinking his art.   Gillette came up with the finalization of his thoughts on the meaning of consumerism and a manipulative role of brands even in the case of children. By contrasting the imagery of wasteland settlements from Third world countries with Disney characters, Gillette is producing rather engaged and eerie comment on today’s society. In addition to that is an interesting aspect that the artist now lives and works in the shadow of nearby Disneyland in Anaheim, and his students frequent that fantasy realm. On the other hand, his thoughts are framed by both the Buddhist notion of life being suffering and the wisdom of German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer’s thinking that a way to end is both through aesthetic and artistic contemplation.   In 2015 Gillette was contacted by the Banksy’s manager via social networks. Namely, the world's famous street artist asked for his several works to be sent due to large group exhibition that was preparing. It was a success and Gillette’s works were sold quickly. Afterward, the artist was called to participate in Banksy’s secretive installation that he was setting up in Weston-super-Mare, UK, three hours from London. Upon arrival, Gillette was perplexed that the whole concept was basically a copy of his 2010 exhibition Dismayland. The artist then decided to use imagery of Banksy’s theme park and insert it in his work.[1]   The continuum of Gillette’s art practice tells much about the effort of maintaining consistency in regards to his personal aesthetics. The use of rather classical painting technique, references to art history from realism to modernism and contemporary topics make his approach progressive and critically inclined. His paintings are strong metaphors of repressive mechanisms of almost every layer of today’s society.  References: ",2230

Li Hongbo,"Has paper become obsolete in contemporary digital age? In a time when even books get increasingly published digitally, what is paper’s role exactly? Li Hongbo, a Chinese artist, uses this medium in order to express his thoughts, feelings, and ultimately, his view of the world. Exploring the endless possibilities of the paper, the artist plays a game of perception, creating a visual language that, in a changing world, has stood the test of time. More than anything, his work surprises. Appearing as traditional sculptures, there is another universe within them – a universe that is unusual and captivating.  Born in Jilin, China, in 1974, the sculptor studied at Jilin Normal University, receiving his Bachelor of Arts from the Fine Art Department in 1996. Five years later, he obtained his Master of Fine Art from Folk Art Department of Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing, and in 2010, he extended his knowledge by obtaining a Master in Fine Art from Experimental Art Department of the same institution. His interest in paper was born while he worked as a book publisher. When it came to the design of every individual book, he had to consider paper. What type of paper suited which book, he needed to understand the characteristics of the material, its style, and durability. Working as an editor has allowed him to increase his knowledge of subjects outside of the field of art, and it also helped in supporting his family life. His dream of working in art has proven to be unwavering from start to finish. At the very beginning of his career, the artist discovered the flexible nature of paper through Chinese paper toys and lanterns. He used the “paper gourd” technique, which has existed in China for a long time, to make a gun. Solid in form and usually attached to killing, and yet, the sculptor turned it into a tool intended for play, or possibly decoration. This way, it lost both the form of a gun and the culture inherent to such a weapon. It was stripped of its original purpose and given a new life. It became a game.[1] Sculptures that he makes are often shaped as human figures, objects or bust replicas from ancient Greece or Renaissance Italy.   In this increasingly digital world, our lives are becoming paper-free. However, there is a tendency by a number of artists to revive their interest in the medium and celebrate the slowly dying material. The sculptor doesn’t consider the material he works with as very important. It is just one of many things he utilizes to present his personal viewpoints. That being said, it should also be acknowledged that he’s doing some amazing things with paper. He challenges the viewer’s very perception of reality. By making that reality change into something else, he’s changing the entire artwork, but also the way that people see and think. What seems as a hard and rigid object, after being opened or provoked, becomes a manifestation of change. His sculptures can move, stretch, spread, twist, bend, contract – and what makes them truly unique, they can return to their original shape. As for the process of making the sculptures, the artist uses the paper gourd technique, where he layers “sheet of paper one by one attaching each with glue at specific points to create a honeycomb pattern. Each sheet is glued individually by hand until I’ve created a small block.”[2] At first, he uses a woodworking saw to create initial cuts, discarding excess paper and reducing the area of the block into the form he’s striving for. As soon as the saw becomes too impractical for cutting, he switches to angle grinder, which allows the artist to achieve greater detail. The finishing touches on the sculpture are applied with sandpaper. Everything is under consideration – depth, width, mass, and center.    Special attention is given to the center of each sculpture. Because the pieces are flexible, the center must be exact. If the center is off, they would simply tip off. It’s not unusual that a regular sculpture takes more than 20,000 of paper, carefully layered up. This colossal number is justified in that very moment when anyone of his sculptures becomes apparently flexible and breaks the chains of reality. Art is not about numbers, nor should it be. But, in this instance, the bigger is better. Hongbo is an extremely talented artist who has found a medium that allows him to explore its endless possibilities. And when talent and possibility meet, the world of contemporary art can only prosper. He is represented by Magda Danysz Gallery.  References:  ",2232

James Rosati,"James Rosati was an American artist best known for his large-scale yet precisely crafted geometric sculptures. About forty of his monumental sculptures are located in the United States and around the world. Born near Pittsburgh, Rosati moved to New York in 1944. There, he became a charter member of the Eighth Street Club and the New York School of Abstract Expressionists. He met and became friends with painters Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline and sculptor David Smith. Later, he taught at Pratt Institute, Cooper Union, Yale and Dartmouth. Early during his career, Rosati experimented with rounded marble sculptures and busts, over time evolving to monumental works of strong Cubist influence, the style he is today best known for. Combining geometric forms of aluminum and steel, these sculptures were made up of elements that were rectilinear, with no two lines or planes that were parallel. The sense of movement in these non-symmetrical works was further enhanced by the changing angle of the sun. In 1969, Hilton Kramer of The New York Times described him as possessing ""a very keen, elegant, intelligent sensibility, at once very poetic and very analytical."" One of his best works Ideogram, commissioned in 1974 for the plaza between the former World Trade Center towers, was lost during 9/11.

Snik,"Hand cut stencils and great attention to detail have over time become the trademark sign of Snik. Artist duo from UK is known for achieving a high level of realism in their work but they are also known for the hand cut stencils that are sometimes made by cutting trough 9 layers of cardboard at the same time. Not burdened by the complex narratives Snik aims to highlight the detail of a single moment in its bold and striking street and canvas works.[1]    Snik is an art duo from the United Kingdom who has been decorating the streets for more than 10 years. During this time they have developed their own bold and provocative style marked with vivid colors and an unbelievable amount of detail. The art duo begins its artistic process by cutting stencils and then looking for a place to paint. This can be a tricky task because stencils can be restricting in size and demand a massive surface to work on so the prospect of looking for a location to paint on can take quite a while.[2] When the surface is selected, the spray paint is applied in a quick and spontaneous way that allow the people to put a touch of exuberance to their work. The duo uses spray paint and carefully executed stencil to create vivid scenes full of energy and movement. Through the intricate play of light and shadow the art-makers capture the excitement of one moment in time.

While drawing inspiration from the paintings by Caravaggio and the Italian renaissance the duo usually depicts a reverse perception to bring traces of light to the foreground. Their realistic portraits have shown subjects emerging from the darkness or from the depth of the see while conveying the intensity build up by the cleverly thought through compositions. Their subjects are often depicted in the moment of frozen action with heir eyes wide open and their hair twirling around them like a whirlpool.   Snik works with different media and techniques to create colorful and inspirational body of work. The careful hand cutting layers of cardboard allow the artists to paint exactly the same thing on the large walls, on the streets, and on the small scale canvases. That's why the artist often reproduce their street artworks on canvas as they did with the What Your Soul Sings painting (pictured above). Their unique imagery that's just as captivating on canvas as it is on large walls, brought the duo many exhibitions in galleries in Europe and all over the world. Since their first solo show in 2011 till now, the artists have gathered an army of fans and admirers across the globe.   References:",2240

George Morton-Clark,"A British artist, George Morton-Clark brings familiar cartoon characters to life, in works imbued with an abstract atmosphere of energy and liveliness. Using oil, acrylic, and charcoal on unprimed canvas, he creates works characterized by bold images and strong colors. Born and raised in Tooting, South London, Morton-Clark is now based in East London. He studied animation for 3 years at London University, Surrey Institute of Art and Design. After gaining his BA he left to pursue an art career but the animation aspect has never really left his craft. Combining intense colors, spontaneous drawings, and nostalgic cartoon characters, Morton-Clark creates seemingly simple works that communicate allegorical stories. Drawing his inspiration from films, music, his travels and pop imagery, he combines abstract elements with figurative, working in expressionistic techniques.  Having rich imagination and sensibility, the artist gives well-known characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Tom and Jerry a newfound sense of vitality and meaning. Staring at us from the canvas in a striking and overemphasized fashion, these characters express a range of emotions, such as surprise or fear. Dr. Rolf Lauter, former Chief Curator and Deputy Director of the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, Germany said of the artist: ""Rather than presenting a grand, elaborate theme about our time, and trying to integrate himself into some section of Art History, he presents pieces that resemble comfortable and fun times spent laughing and talking to close friends.""",2245

Greg Guillemin,"Known as a man who refused to let his childhood passions fade quietly into the past, Greg Guillemin (also known as Léon) is a French illustrator specialized in graphic design and comic character illustrations. Combining many different styles and concepts, this painter is recognized for his Pop art-like paintings depicting comic books superheroes, movie characters and other popular characters from our culture. Searching for both the materials and inspirations within old school comic books and video games, Greg Guillemin relied on the 1930s vintage visuals and modern day Pop Art heritage in order to establish his incredible visual vocabulary which is underlined by a variegated, minimalistic technique. Interestingly, this Paris-based author does not see himself as a usual artist, rather preferring to call himself an Eclectic Graphical Gamer - a term which actually defines the kind of work he makes rather well.  Greg Guillemin is one of those authors whose rise to fame can be partially attributed to the wonder of Internet - most of his projects attained international success via the World Wide Web. Some of his most famous series include the Exercises of Style and Famous Capsules. Both of these are good indicators to anyone interested in analyzing the style of Greg Guillemin. The minimalistic manner blended with a strong Pop sense is what defines this Parisian's method and this phenomenal mix is certainly one of a kind on the contemporary scene. It is humorous, straight to the point and simply craves attention from the viewers. Also counted among the most popular projects of this author, Guillemin’s collection titled The Pop Icons is an entertaining inside peek at the hidden and colorful, although slightly steamy, life of our most beloved heroes and heroines. It should also be noted that, since the January of the year 2014, Guillemin started releasing sculptures as well, further expanding the body of his work.  Arguably the most exceptional project Greg Guillemin authored so far during his career was The Secret Life of Heroes series - a collection of paintings which shows popular culture characters in their fictional mundane everyday life. Whenever anyone watched a superhero flick of any kind, every single person at least on one occasion thought how an average day of a superhero truly looks like. How do they shave, do they eat junk food, how often do they shower, etc? Guillemin's Secret Life of Heroes does not answer every single question that comes to mind, but it does offer a special opportunity to see how some fictional characters spend their time outside of comic books and movies. Besides being a huge hit online, these drawings gained substantial fame thanks to publications in major print medias such as Beaux Arts Magazine, Playboy and GQ. Such a success allowed Greg to launch a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in February 2015, organized with intentions of financing his first monograph entitled For Your Eyes Only[1]. Guillemin's work has been exhibited in several galleries across various major cities in Europe and the United States, including the likes of Paris, Geneva, London, Rome, New York City and Miami.   Besides his paintings, it should be noted that Greg Guillemin is also responsible on other cultural fronts as well. He is an official Strategic Planner and Creation Director of the French communications agency Infoflash. Additionally, Greg is also a leading figure of the Geek Art movement. However, although his other activities are undoubtedly remarkable on their own, Guillemin's paintings remain the definite highlight of this author's career. Call it nostalgia, but there is simply something mesmerizing within Guillemin's compositions which seem to be very capable of pulling on our childhood memories on the best possible way. When we combine that warm sentimental feeling with the minimalistic and colorful technique Greg developed for his art, it comes as no surprise that this artist is one of the most interesting authors on the French scene. And, in all honesty, we do not see that changing anytime soon.  References:   ",2250

Fazzino’s skillful and detailed compositions have earned him a lot of attention over the years since the artist basically remained loyal to the analog technique despite the digital innovations. Such an approach is his main feature and provides the very works with an additional almost vintage layer.  Charles Fazzino is born in 1955, in New York City. He grew up in a family of mixed ethnicity and full of interest in art. Namely, his Finish father was a sculptor and mother was an Italian fashion shoe designer and was from an early childhood acquainted with arts. While in high school, Fazzino had his first solo exhibition in 1968. He attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and graduated with his bachelor of arts in 1977. In the 80’s the artist started to experiment 3-D silkscreen serigraphs and showed it for the first time in Greenwich Village Art Show and finally began using the silkscreen printing process in 1986.   The very process of production has a central role in Fazzino’s work. The three-dimensional compositions are a product of several stages. The base is always a flat drawing that is edited step by step over the course of time perhaps weeks or even months before the limited edition process even begins. Afterward, the prepared model is sent to a silkscreen printer who spends months hand-printing the reproductions. In the next stage, sheets are returned to the artist’s studio where the team of almost 40 craftsmen manually in order achieve the 3D layered effect. The final touch of manual editing is with glitter and Swarovski crystals.[1]   Fazzino’s adornment towards sports is rather obvious since he has produced quite a number of works depicting huge sports events. Only for Major League Baseball All-Star Games, the artist has created limited edition of ten artworks and in 2014 he decided to donate it and raise funds to support the charity's mission. The special place takes Super Bowl and the artist pays an homage to the event by capturing it on canvas. On the 75th Anniversary of Little League Baseball Fazzino was commissioned to realize official artwork and was installed in the World of Little League Museum. The artist was even commissioned by the United States Olympic Committee to realize official artwork for 2013 Warrior Games.   For the 46th annual Grammy Awards Charles Fazzino was asked to contribute with official artwork. In a collaboration with one of the world’s best-known architects Frank Gehry, Roy Feinson, the mosaic artist, and eccentric photographer David LaChapelle, he created outstanding official artwork. In 2010 JFK International Airport commissioned an artwork from Fazzino for the installment in Collection for American Airlines at Terminal 8. It consists out of two pieces – a large 3D rotating sculpture of an aircraft and is dedicated to all the flights of American Airlines. The work is titled From New York...to the World. There is also a colorful three-dimensional mural depicting an urban landscape of the city itself.   In 2012 Charles Fazzino became involved in the theater due to the collaboration with the producers of the project under the name The Ride. The artist’s intervention implied decorating the bus with his artwork for and interactive tour through Manhattan. It was a full success since Fazzino created the utmost experience which was practically half tourist attraction, half site specific and familiarized observers with the streets of most famous NYC district. The artist was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience in 2013.   The astounding career which lasts for over more than three decades is recognized due to continuity and immanence efforts to maintain precision and devotion as main features. Interestingly, Fazzino is often referred to as a pop culture historian because of the breadth of his work and the references to the pioneers of the Pop art movement such as Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Roy Lichtenstein. During the course of time, his works became exhibited, commissioned and finally part of various private and museum collections and his contribution to the increasing perception of 3D pop art is really important. All of that makes Fazzino’s art practice highly valued and respectable and the main reason is that he is always focused on the communication with the audience offering them the best possible visual experience.

Mike Dargas,"Mike Dargas is a German visual artist and painter that recently became widely known for his large-scale hyperrealistic oil portraits. A true master of the trompe l'oeil style, he amazes people with his skill sets in such amount that one can’t be completely sure if its pixels or brushstrokes one is watching. Dargas is playing with the notions of perception, but his devotion to the shadings and rich shifts of color, as well as a keen talent for catching the essence of people portrayed, must be noted as rare and remarkable qualities. It is not strange, better to say, it was quite expected, for this young artist to emerge and establish himself on the contemporary art scene.  Dargas was born in Cologne in 1983. Since a young age, he showed an extraordinary talent for drawing and painting which was recognized and nourished by his mother. His first works that draw attention was when he was only eleven years old and painted in chalk and pastel the cathedral square in Cologne. Since then, he tried himself in various fields of art, from sculpture to tattoos. He started doing tattoos as a fourteen-year-old and made quite a reputation out of it, receiving numerous awards and prizes. It is interesting that Dargas doesn’t have a traditional approach to education; he learned the techniques and secrets of the craft through independent study. His international breakthrough happened via Instagram. Namely, the curator and director of the Opera Gallery in London, Jean-David Malat, was amazed by his technique after seeing the work on Dargas’s Instagram account.  In Dargas work, people faces are often covered or concealed with something – sometimes its liquids like honey or melted chocolate, sometimes translucent paper or fabric. Those materials are allusions to masks used to protect, hide or play in our everyday life, but as well a perfect way to show Dargas’ meticulously and obsessively precise technique. He starts his work process by making a series of photographs, that he later uses as a model for oil painting. The liquids dripping down woman’s faces have a vicious brilliance about them, bestowing the seductiveness and sexually charged up-close portraits of beautiful women. But his subject varies in age, beauty, and qualities. He proved himself a master of catching the specific emotion or variety of thoughts, conflicts or moods of portrayed people.   Mike Dargas’s work fits well in the contemporary Zeitgeist – the need to overcome reality with hyperrealism seems like an ongoing cultural urge. Since he is inspired by Dali, Caravaggio, and HR Giga it will be interesting to see in which direction will this young artist take the development of the topics or realism - will it contort itself to surrealism once it closes the impulse of preciseness. Until you can check his exhibition Transformation in the C24 art gallery in New York. The artist is represented by Galerie Benjamin Eck, from Munich.  ",2262

Laurie Anderson,"Known for her pioneering work that spans over a wide range of mediums and techniques, Laurie Anderson is an American artist whose pieces can be best described as experimentations with performance and multimedia projects. A successful composer, musician and film director as well, this New York City-based author initially trained in violin and sculpting before she focused her attention on a variety of performance projects during the 1970s. It should be noted that, although she was always extremely well-regarded within the neo-avant-garde arts circles, Anderson became a musical icon in the 1980s for her hit single O Superman, a song that reached number two on the UK pop charts. It should also be stated that Laurie Anderson was married to the legendary Lou Reed and the two remained a couple up until the time of the late musician's death in 2013.  Laurie Anderson was born on the 5th of June in the year of 1947, in the town of Glen Ellyn, Illinois. She was the daughter of Mary Louise and Arthur T. Anderson. After graduating from the Glenbard West High School, young Laurie attended Mills College in California and eventually graduated from the Barnard College where she was mainly studying art history. By the end of 1972, Anderson received her MFA in sculpture from the Columbia University. Her first performance piece was a symphony played on automobile horns was performed in 1969. In the early 1970s, she was drawing underground comic books, working as an instructor, a critic for magazines such as Artforum and was in charge of illustrating a few children books[1]. Soon, Laurie will start dedicating all of her efforts to performance art and similar projects - one of her more famous early pieces was titled as Duets on Ice and it involved her playing the violin along with a recording while wearing ice skates with the blades frozen into a block of ice. The performance would end only when the ice block would completely melt, allowing the author to free herself.   Other notable projects from the early periods of the artist's career were New York Social Life and The Time to Go, both of which enjoyed massive success from the critics. During the late 1970s, Anderson made a number of musical recordings that were released either privately or were included on compilations of avant-garde music. However, it should really be noted that many of Anderson's earliest recordings remain unreleased to this day whilst many were only issued in limited quantities. In the year of 1980, Anderson was on the receiving end of an Honorary Doctorate from the San Francisco Art Institute. Two years later, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts—Film.   As it was already mentioned in the opening paragraph, Anderson became widely known outside the arts world in 1981 with the single O Superman, originally released in a limited quantity by B. George's One Ten Records in 1981. A few years later, Laurie starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave and also created a few soundtracks for other independent films. From the 1990s, Anderson and Lou Reed collaborated on a number of recordings together. Furthermore, Anderson became more aware of science and its importance to the human race, becoming a bigger part of scientific shows and festivals. This fascination with science eventually blended with her artistic practices, offering an interesting mix that will become a unique form of work Anderon is now known for. In 2003, Laurie even became NASA's first artist-in-residence, an event that inspired her performance piece called The End of the Moon. With the explanation that she provided an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world and to mankind's enjoyment and understanding of life, this artist was awarded the 2007 Gish Prize. Over the course of the 1990s and the early portions of the third millennium, Laurie Anderson received an astonishing number of awards and held even more exhibitions of her work, as well as developing countless projects that were all deemed as being great accomplishments[2][3]. She was also the author of countless musical albums and singles, whether they were of the avant-garde, experimental sort or the more conventional type. Regardless of what she was working with, Anderson was always extremely successful and there is not taking that away from her.   The reason why the art of Laurie Anderson is so hard to define is also the main reason why everything she ever created is held in such a high regard - it's incredibly pioneering and utterly unique. It defies any attempt to be precisely categorized or fully defined simply because there are not many similar arts out there deserving of being compared with the pieces of Anderson. With that being said, Laurie's particular use of language, technology and visual imagery is simply astonishing. The way she was able to provide her expression with the circumstances to thrive and evolve is also been quite crucial as these types of artists need to constantly test themselves in order to be the best that they can be. Ultimately, the work of Laurie Anderson keeps developing to this day and we shall surely be surprised if at one point she stops being observed as one of the most pivotal artists that emerged during the course of the 20th century.

Alvaro Naddeo,"Alvaro Naddeo is a Brazilian artist known for combining universal with local elements in his watercolor artworks. The artist's nomadic lifestyle served as an inspiration for his work as every place the artist lived in left its mark to his autobiographical artworks. In his pieces, you can notice a pharmacy bag from New York, a ""proibido estacionar"" sign from São Paulo and the outlines of a Los Angeles highway. With his simple yet effective visual language, Alvaro Naddeo conveys true cosmopolitan spirit and social concern.  Alvaro Naddeo was born in Brazil as a descendant of the Uruguayan parents. His father was an artist and Alvaro Naddeo spent his childhood drawing on the floor of his parent's studio. But his artistic career was suddenly interrupted in the artists teenage years. Thinking that he'll never possess his father skills, the artist decided to give up art and turn to advertising. After 20 years of working in advertising and design, and as an art director in Leo Burnett Sao Paulo and several American advertising agencies, the artist finally decided to go back to art. Living in New York a city of great dynamic and contrast caused the artist to rethink his choices in life and go back to his first love - painting.   Apart from his father who had an outstanding influence on the artist's work Alvaro Naddeo is also influenced by artists like Edward Hoppe and Norma Rockwell but also by the works of those who use elements of advertising in their work like Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, and Ed Ruscha. The artist is fascinated with color combinations of Robert Indiana and Stuart Davis but also by the works of Charles Sheeler, Paul Cadmus and Lee Bontecou. The artist starts his artistic process by loosely sketching the outlines of his future work. He then takes a break and lets his ideas mature before he goes back to finish the piece several days or weeks later. Then he starts to experiment with different possibilities and compositions. The artist uses Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to correct proportions and scale among object and get a more accurate perspective after which he transfers the base of the image to his watercolor paper where his pieces get their final shape.   Alvaro Naddeo is inspired by marginalized urban objects and the process of their decay. The natural process of deterioration that decomposes the objects, color texture and shape inspires the artist to continuously search and find a new sense of beauty in old discarded objects. On a political level, Alvaro Naddeo uses art as a tool for criticizing social inequality, over-consumption and the consequences of over-exploitation caused by human greed. The artist uses his work to open a dialogue about these uncomfortable issues that others often try to avoid. The artist is represented by Thinkspace gallery.  ",2274

David Choong Lee,"David Choong Lee is a Korean artist who combines versatile genres such as graffiti, collage, portraiture and graphic design to create an array of vibrant figurative and abstract artworks. His influences are diverse and include famous painters like Vincent Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Sukdo, but also influences from other arts such as underground music.  David Choong Lee was born in Seoul, Korea in 1966. In 1993 the artist moved to the United States to study at the Academy of Art In San Francisco. It was there that he created his first portrait depicting homeless people in Tenderloin, San Francisco’s quarter where he resided while attending the University. In time he expanded his area of interest and begun to depict some of the local recognizable characters thus powerfully portraying the diversity of the city.    In 2010 the Korean artist began to merge abstract and geometrical pieces with his figurative portraits to create impressive assemblages and landscapes. By portraying the energy of space the artist manages to transport the viewer into his world of color, depth, and detail. His creative process has become more random than before. The artist usually starts his paintings without a proper idea of what he’ll paint or how his artworks are going to look like in the end. His painting process also represents a process of discovery as the image starts to take on a life of its own. He uses acrylic, latex and aerosol paint to create works that can be described as moving between organic and geometric. His non-figurative vividly colored compositions arise from what he calls his inner visions deeply rooted inside the artist's soul. His works are inspired by meticulous studies of physics and Darwinism. Every one of his images contained slightly altered forms and variations that show the beauty present in details.    David Choong Lee is also prolific for his assemblage pieces the most famous of which Is locate in the hallway of San Francisco Grand Hyatt hotel. An installation composed of oil and acrylic paintings on wooden boxes depicts an array of people who the artist encountered during the 20 years of is life in San Francisco from homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk of his old neighborhood to those who stood as models in his classes. He has published several books including God made dirt, and dirt don’t hurt, 4 WORDS, DIRT, and CONVERGENCE.   The artist is represented by Jonathan LeVine Projects.

Mr Doodle,"“Doodling” is familiar to many of us as a joyous absent-minded activity from our youth, and can evoke nostalgic feelings about a time when our minds could just wander off during a lecture or homework. To spend our time sketching aimlessly might sound nearly impossible now. With adult life’s overwhelming responsibilities, our cognitive attention remains fully consumed, with no room for anything unproductive.  British street artist Sam Cox, or better known as Mr. Doodle, transports his audience back into the realm of childish daydreams. His dizzying artworks, which he refers to as both a “growing drawing virus” and “Graffiti Spaghetti”,  feature black and white clusters of doodle figures that seem to be growing endlessly, covering every possible surface like canvases, clothing and entire rooms. This charming yet rebellious style has earned Mr. Doodle recognition in the global commercial art world and beyond. Beginnings of Doodleland Sam Cox was born in Kent, England in 1994. He has had a passion for art and creativity from a young age. When he was just 9 years old, he would scribble his signature doodles all over his bedroom, classroom and various objects and pieces of furniture around the house. From his infinite sketches and drawing there soon emerged a coherent visual universe he calls “Doodleland”, which sees the world as a maze of interlinking characters, shapes and patterns. The same childlike intensity, energy and play continues to feed into Mr. Doodle’s practice today. ‘Obsessive’ Style Cox characterises his practice as “OCD- Obsessive Compulsive Drawing”, which seems like a fitting description for the ceaseless drive behind his ever-expanding Doodleland. Spontaneity plays a crucial role in sustaining this obsessive drive. His artworks are usually created by improvisation on the spot, always responding to the given environment, whether that’s the interior of a gallery or the street. The most obvious feature of his scenes is visual overload: a myriad of characters, letters, forms and symbols populate the busy compositions, for which the artist cites everyday influences like cartoons, video games and cereal boxes. They flow into each other to be deciphered in an endless interactive game with their audience.  As a street artist, Mr. Doodle’s work often involves public space and the urban landscape. No matter the location, he enjoys creating an immersive experience for the viewer and blurring boundaries between public and private space, art and life. Through his viral artistic interventions into pristine gallery spaces, he seeks to challenge the concept of the exclusive “white cube” gallery - his doodles multiply across both physical and symbolic boundaries. Doodles in Art History While there’s an universal charm to his works, they also demonstrate Mr. Doodle’s  knowledge of art history and its markets. In an ongoing series, he appropriates classical works of art into colourful, humorous renditions such as The Garden of Doodley Delights (2019), Mona Doodle (2019) and The Doodled Supper. This places them into dialogue with a wider historic fine art canon, and also paves their way into the appropriate markets. There are additional conceptual parallels between Cox’s practice and that of top contemporary artists. He shares an interest in “obsessive” repeating patterns and vibrant color scheme with Yayoi Kusama, for whom these manifest as infinite patterns of colourful dots. Equally, he plays clear homage to the visual language of Keith Haring, who similarly used simple figures and often incorporated entire rooms into his artworks.  The main difference between Mr. Doodle and his admitted role model Haring is that while the latter made explicitly political art, Mr. Doodle keeps the two realms separate. There is no overtly critical or political message encoded in the artist’s Doodleland, except for the politics of accessibility, which is something he has remained committed to in his ethos. The element of humour in his work remains crucial for him: ""A lot of art is lacking a sense of humour. It’s a fun thing to be able to draw and create your own world, and sometimes it is funny. I’m not afraid of people laughing at me or if they don’t get it."" Growing Success Mr. Doodle has been taking the art market by a storm since 2015, catching the eye of many young collectors and art enthusiasts, especially on the East Asian markets. Sotheby’s auction house granted him his big break with the successful Sotheby’s Hong Kong exhibition in 2019, Mr. Doodle Invades Sotheby’s  featuring 52 works by the artist. These were all doodles appropriating famous works of art, including takes on the Mona Lisa, Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Big Wave among many others.  His large-scale, vibrant green painting Spring (2019), which is a part of the artist’s Four Seasons series, fetched for JPY 109,250,000 at Tokyo Chuo Auction in 2020. This marked a stunning new record, while the previous top hammer price was set at Sotheby’s Hong Kong with his work RED ZAP Mr Doodle 紅色的活力 (2019) claiming HK$525,000.  His latest impressive auction performance took place at Sotheby’s 2020 Summer Hong Kong sale, seeing 16 paintings by Mr. Doodle soaring way past their original estimates. Among them were Blue Kitty (2020) selling for HK$175,000 and Mr. Doodler (2020), a humorous resin figure realizing HK$47,500..  Mr. Doodle often pursues collaborations with various brands and designers such as FENDI and Samsung, adapting their logos into his signature doodle-style. These partnerships are integral to the artist’s commitment to making his works accessible to a wider public beyond the commercial and fine art worlds. His recent partnership was with PUMA to create a unique series of trainers, hoodies and bags covered in his signature pattern in 2020.  Mr. Doodle’s popularity has been growing nearly as unstoppably as his graphic universe. He was featured in a short video on BBC England introducing his ambitious practice and has gained himself an impressive Instagram following. Instagram is a platform he keeps updated regularly, often publishing about his artworks in progress - a practical choice for the self-represented artist. Doodle’s practice is a delightful blend of high and low art, therefore he is favoured by both prestigious auction houses and galleries and the public. His persona as a street artist is as approachable and familiar as his artworks, especially in comparison to some of his peers, who often choose to conceal their real identities and shroud their practice in mystery. His artworks remind us to stay connected to our inner child and tune into our creative Self, not for any specific outcome but for the pure joy of play.

This was reinforced by meeting André Breton and coming into contact with Marcel Duchamp and the other European Surrealists in New York at the time.  ",2282
Cinta Vidal,"Barcelona-based muralist and illustrator Cinta Vidal makes artworks that defy gravity and structural conventions with encapsulated scenes of intersecting perspectives. Usually painted with acrylic on wood panels, Vidal's works are often called un-gravity constructions and they have a way of making the viewer both intrigued and frightened by what's placed in front of them. The author herself explains that each piece she authors examines how a person’s internal perspective of life may not always match up with the reality around them. Besides these kinds of paintings, Vidal also works on massive scale backdrops for operas, giant pieces made with a large, broomstick-sized brush.  Cinta Vidal has been drawing since she was a kid - she studied at Escola Massana in Barcelona and when she was around the age of 16, she started working as an apprentice in Taller de Escenografia Castells Planas in St. Agnès de Malanyanes (Castells Planas Scenography Atelier). There, she learned to love scenography and the backdrop trade, influenced by her mentors, Josep and Jordi Castells. After her artistic vocabulary was developed, Vidal has been busy creating complex acrylic paintings on wood panels that reflect how our outer realities frequently do not reflect our inner natures. Manipulating everyday objects and spaces placed in impossible forms, Vidal wants to show us that the inner dimension of each one of us does not match the mental structures within us regardless of how much we try to synchronize our emotions with our surroundings. When observed from a traditional perspective, these kinds of concepts might be logically better investigated with abstraction, but Cinta Vidal stayed true to figuration for the entirety of her career. This artist's creative ideas want to show us just how hard balancing and fitting everything that shapes our daily space is, everything from our relationships to our professions, from our ambitions to our dreams.   In many ways, Cinta Vidal sees her work as a metaphor for the methods in which we shape our world. She also explores the frightening impossibility of completely understanding everything going on around us despite which we are still able to successfully navigate through the maze of life. And as the case usually is, the author herself is the one who explains these artistic ideas the best: I want the viewers to recognize what they are seeing, but to see it in a very different, unstructured, broken way.

Ian Burns,"Born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia in 1964 and living and working in New York, Ian Burns is renowned for inventive sculptural works that combine consumer objects with digital technologies. Seeing curiosity as the first of all passions, he believes that by provoking the investigative impulse in the viewer there is scope to challenge their expectations and self-awareness. Often animated by light and movement, Burns' witty assemblages explore the constructs of contemporary society. These are comprised of humming circuits of wires, fans, lights, motors and other more familiar materials such as plastic utensils, stepladders, buckets, chopping boards, etc. Highly visual and engaging, these works invoke curiosity with the very ways they function. Encouraging a playful spirit of investigation, his works provoke active and self-aware consideration of consumerist culture and modes of consumption.

At the core of his practice is the impact of technological aesthetics on contemplation and the understanding of physicality. ",2359

These works always carry a sense of ephemerality, highlighting the disappearance of ""the city"" as a determined order and determinant of the idea of ​​global progress. Among his most notable series is La mar negra & La mirada, which highlights the cultural clash between the First and Third World.

Brian McKee,"American photographer, Brian McKee, described himself as “a visual historian” that ventured into the world to capture and convey the aspects of world history. His oeuvre perfectly depicts the passage of time and carries an important message that nothing in the world is permanent. The cultures that once thrived and created structures of immense beauty, now lye abandoned and forgotten. He illuminates the declining aspect of humanity that repeatedly creates and destroys. The artist has worked in numerous countries of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, as well as, Turkey, and the United States. McKee’s work explored the current and past social and political circumstances of countries around the world. However, he was never interested in capturing the beauty of the place but to compose poetic images that spoke complex and untold narratives. Among his subjects are houses, towns, and buildings that he strongly believed held the key to the understanding of culture and society. They were the products of political and personal circumstances that created them and today stand as true witnesses. McKee got inspired by his visit to Soviet military bases in former East Germany in 1999. There he witnesses the decline of the historical sites on a never before seen scale. From there on, for 15 years, he traveled the world focused on capturing the remains of various cultures, fascinated by the ""chaos"" that has always been such an inseparable part of society.   Born in 1977 in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, Brian McKee studied photography with Barbara Ess, Stephen Shore, and Larry Fink at the Interlochen Arts Academy and Bard College. He lived in several countries, following his latest creative interest from New York to Vienna and Istanbul. The artist worked for three years as an assistant to photographer John Ashbery. For a time, he was also John Ashbery’s assistant with whom he studied writing. Before his death in 2018, he completed several movie scripts.   McKee’s last exhibition was a photographic series titled SOK, which depicted desolate and abandoned locations in Turkey, a country that has a rich history of religious and political turmoil. These sites that are from various centuries stand on a unique geographic location, along the Silk Route. The artist made parallels of today's global commerce with the one of the past. Even though McKee’s artworks depict the collapse of cultures and societies, he does not believe it is inevitable but necessary. For how else will something new grow if the old does not crumble. From the ashes of the past, there has always been a rebirth. McKee said:  ",2361
Leila Pazooki,"Born in 1977 in Iran, artist Leila Pazooki explores the concept of borders and the manner in which information, language, visual vernacular, and cultural associations are contorted and conflated, as they cross physical and imaged boundaries. Through the medium of paintings, video, photography, and installations, the artist fights against prejudices. Her work has been shown at galleries in New York, Teheran, Berlin, Shanghai, Mexico City, Dubai, and London. One theme that connects all her work is the artist's fascination with the concept of borders. Whether it is an inter-human relationships barrier or the artistic one, Pazooki is not afraid to step over it.   Leila Pazooki attended National Art Academy in Tehran, where she studied painting. After graduating, she moved to Munich, where she received her Master’s Degree at The Academy of Fine Arts. Her work often consists of layered ""forbidden"" images manipulated to veil their illicit content, bringing to question the notion and validity of acceptability and dissolving the distinction between what is tolerable and what is taboo. Deeply cosmopolitan, her works serve as visual material aiding in the fight against the hegemony of borders that stratify the world by way of political and canonical prejudices. Pazooki has a deep connection and is drawn to calligraphy, for she sees the text as a medium capable of crossing any linguistic or cultural divide. A view that was popular with Abstract Expressionists, Dadaists, and street artists from the midcentury.  The artist’s first solo exhibition was at Golestan Gallery in Tehran (1996). In the series titled The Aesthetic of Censorship (2009), Pazooki removed all the central figures from the world-famous masterpieces. In this way, she is illuminating the role that censorship had in dictating societal values. Through displaced art objects, she challenges all the conventional ways the art is viewed and received. Through her art, Pazooki might seem like a feminist fighter, however, this would just scratch the surface. In her latest work titled Reflection of our Rights at Art Dubai 2021, the artist created a rainbow light installation. A calligraphy piece had the text in Arabic, which translates Hope and Equality. With this artwork, Pazooki has created a symbol of hope that transcends all genders. Leila Pazooki said: Leila Pazooki is among the most talented contemporary female artists whose artwork has often been described as ahead of its time. The artist's ultimate goal is to give hope to humanity and equal rights no matter the sex, race, or nation. The work is unique for it speaks to everybody no matter the language barriers or cultural differences. For example, in the series titled Moment of Glory, she directly criticizes the Western-centric art world. By describing the artist from other regions, like Asia and Africa, in the context of their Western counterparts. Leila Pazooki lives and works in Dubai.  ",2362

William King,"A contemporary American sculptor, William King created work that spanned countless media and usually revolved around the figurative portrayal of human figures. These human figures traced social attitudes through the last half of the 20th century, often poking sly and poignant fun at human follies and foibles. Born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1925, he attended the University of Florida, until he moved to New York in 1945 and graduated from Cooper Union in 1948. While at school, he saw the sculptures of David Smith, which inspired him to commit to the medium. Humorous and imbued with social commentary, King's work first offered an alternative to Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s. He once explained that ""the sole purpose of the arts is neither description nor imitation, but the creation of unknown beings from elements which are always present but not apparent."" Described as a sculpture of comic gesture, his work drew from the vast repertory of socialized human gesture a very personal vocabulary of contemporary sculptural forms. Working with aluminum and vinyl, he arranged his painted figures in configurations that transform various social activities into satirical or fantastic situations, exploring the state of mind of modern man and woman, and their tragicomic relations.",2365
Neil Williams,"An American artist, Neil Williams pioneered the shaped canvas during the 1960s. His work of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s is associated with geometric abstraction, hard-edge painting, color field, and lyrical abstraction. Born in 1934 in Bluff, Utah, Williams graduated from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1959 and moved to New York City that same year. He began exhibiting his paintings in New York in 1960. His first solo show was held at the Green Gallery in Manhattan in 1964, and during that same year, he participated in the exhibition The Shaped Canvas, organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, alongside Frank Stella and Paul Feeley. One of the first American artists to investigate the aesthetic potential of the irregularly shaped canvas, Williams initially depicted hard-edged geometric forms, experimenting with hexagonal, polygonal, and trapezoidal canvases with as many as fourteen sides. These works were rendered in bold, saturated pinks, greens, blues, and blacks. His later paintings evolved into expressive, energetic abstractions, in which he synthesized landscape and floral elements inspired by the ambiance he encountered on visits to Brazil. The artist was in the process of moving to Brazil when he died in New York City in 1988 at the age of 53. ",2366
Lloyd Hamrol,"Coming of age in the vibrant, freewheeling, and highly charged art world of the 1960s Los Angeles, Lloyd Hamrol made a name for himself as a creator of conceptual installations with his studio-based work. Born in 1937 in San Francisco, Hamrol graduated from UCLA and currently lives in Los Angeles. In 1965, he was presented with the New Talent Purchase Award by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and was subsequently featured in the museum’s exhibition Five Younger Los Angeles Artists along with Tony Berlant and Llyn Foulkes. During the 1960s, Hamrol produced laminate-on-wood rectangular units, or “modules,” as an embodiment of his idea of indeterminacy (uncertainty). ""Each set could represent the concept, and the narrative could be told through a folding-unfolding game played by the viewer,” he explained. Since the 1970s, he has worked primarily in the field of public art, creating work across the country. In these works, he helped chart the sculptural territory between landscape architecture and architectural space with both monumental and intimate gestures. Made of industrial felt, his recent sculptures integrate the directness of drawing with dimensional form building. ",2367
Dan Rizzie,"The American artist and musician Dan Rizzie is a skillful and inventive painter, known for his detailed collage work and the textural quality of his surfaces. His multifaceted mixed-media pieces are often influenced by the rhythms of the natural world, incorporating materials such as flashe, parchment, printed materials, and newsprint. Born in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1951, Rizzie grew up in India, Egypt, Jordan and Jamaica. He received his BFA from Hendrix College in Arkansas in 1973 and his MFA from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas in 1975. Rizzie uses a range of materials in his work, from layers of newspaper to paint, wax and dirt, often incorporating filigree, historic decorative patterns, and bold botanic imagery. Informed by his extraordinary knowledge of art history, but in off-beat, even eccentric ways, his art combines a rather hermetic element in his signs and symbols and his love of collage. Deeply connected to the natural world, his symbols display a range of associations from microscopic views of single cells to floral portraits influenced by the tradition of English botanical illustration, but also organic, geometric patterns. Expressing a uniquely individual set of feelings, Rizzie’s vision is as truly sui generis as it is possible for a traditionally grounded artist to be. ",2368
Robert Dash,"A painter, poet, and extraordinary gardener, Robert Dash is known for painting bucolic landscapes with allusions to inhabitants, but usually absent any figures. He drew inspiration for his art from the extensive gardens he cultivated on Long Island, New York.  Born in downtown Manhattan in 1934, Dash never formally studied painting. He developed a strong interest in the Abstract Expressionists, particularly De Kooning, in college. He attended the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, in part to escape the city. After college, he worked for Arts and then Art News, while painting at night. In 1961, the first solo exhibition of his work was presented at the Kornblee Gallery. Comparing the process of gardening to that of art making, Dash once said: “It illustrates—the same thing with painting—the unlimited possibilities in a small area, because the garden is very small. I mean you can stunningly create the new composition by just slight movement or clipping, the same way you do in painting, wipe out, and so forth.” He is also a founder of The Madoo, one of the great American small gardens of the late 20th century that is today a unique living tribute to his artistic imagination.

Gwladys Alonzo,"A French contemporary sculptor, Gwladys Alonzo is known for the aesthetic and lexical vocabulary that reveals confrontations between the natural and the industrial. Born in 1990 in France, Alonzo grew up in a family of Polish and Sicilian immigrants in various rural and industrial areas of France. The wide-ranging geography and environments she experienced growing up informed her sensitivity to codes and identities of different cultures. She attended the Ecole Supérieur d'Art et Design de Saint-Etienne and the Faculté des Beaux-Arts, Güzel Sanatlar Fakültesi, Istanbul. She currently lives and works in Mexico. Alonzo's works are organic entities whose forms are influenced by her daily walks. During these walks, she encounters different found objects among the landscapes, reappropriating them in her sculpture. This provides her work with a certain precarious vulnerability, as these materials seek to maintain their formal integrity at all costs. From Latin America to Europe, the landscape she investigates continues to grow, a rural culture confronting an expanding universe on an international scale. Alonzo employs common materials classic in sculpture, like metal, wax, concrete, marble, and stone, using unconventional techniques. She seeks to break the stereotype of the masculine practice of sculpture where massiveness rhymes with perpetuity and immobility. ",2377

These bodies of work are supposed to reference the modernist vocabularies advocated by Russian constructivism and the Bauhaus school. By arranging the symbols and forms in a meaningless ways, the artist means to suggest the failure of modernism, highlighting its status as a purely formal language. He recognizes the language’s promise of uniform interpretation as a “system of meaning with inherent flaws and implied power structures.” ",2378
Jean Terry Efiaimbelo,"An artist from Madagascar, Jean Terry Efiaimbelo continues the tradition of creating aloalos, steles that serve as grave makers that represent particular memories of the deceased.

The descendants of Efiaimbelo, members of the Temaromainte clan live on the land of their Ancestors, amongst the “invisible”, in Androka. Today, only five members of the clan are preserving this unique practice in the same style as their distinguished inspirer. Aloalos are traditionally made from Mendorave, a very dense, rare and sacred wood exclusively cut and handled by sculptors. The piece is comprised of two parts - the base, which is a pole, and a horizontal platter on top of it, which features a figurative scene depicting a moment of daily life, a tale, a legend, ancestral wisdom, or a stories shared by members of the Termaromainte clan.

Joe Eula,"Born in Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1925, Joe Eula was a prominent fashion illustrator of the 20th century. His artwork was published in The New York Herald Tribune as part of Eugenia Sheppard’s fashion columns in the 1950s. Throughout his career, he worked with prominent artists and performers alike. Also, he created concert posters, costumes, and album covers for Liza Minnelli, Bette Midler, the Supremes, and Miles Davis. Notorious for quick thinking and improvisation that often astonished designers who, in turn, had unshakable trust in his judgment. Eula worked in Life magazine and was the creative director of Halston for ten years. Joe Eula showed remarkable talent at an early age. His work was published in Town & Country magazine while studying at the Art Students League of New York. In the 40s he was highly influenced by Dior's New Look, seen as riotous for its revolutionary fashion curves. From then on, he often exhibited the rebellious side of a provocateur. Refusing to keep silent when something was not good, he famously shouted out in the middle of the Yves Saint Laurent couture show that it was terrible and walked out. Eula worked with a number of contemporary artists, but one of the more famous collaborations was with Andy Warhol, who saw him as the most important person in New York. He famously said that Eula “knows everybody who’s anybody. Anybody who’s somebody… all the really chic people”. In the 50s and 60s, most magazines did not have a big enough budget for photographers, so an illustrator was the next best solution. Eula brought the unique visual flair that amazed the designers and fashion lovers alike. Liza Minnelli remembers that “Joe didn’t go into great detail in his drawings, but he showed you what the object was about”. Eula became friends with Coco Chanel and maintained a close working relationship with a number of designers, including the famous Yves St Laurent, Versace, and Givenchy. The unparalleled talent for capturing the female movement, done with a brisk, light hand in ink and charcoal, distinguished his artwork. He designed the costumes and set of Jerome Robbins’ performance Dances at a Gathering in 1969 at the New York City Ballet. Also, he won a Tony award for exceptional costumes designs for Private Lives on Broadway. Eula continued working until his death in 2004. Among his last designs was a line of china based on flowers and animals for Tiffany, and for Times Magazine, he drew his last fashion illustrations of series of fall coats. ",2433

Bill Ward,"American cartoonist Bill Ward is best known for risqué comic strip illustrations and now legendary character Torchy. Often called the “good girl” artist, he came to prominence during the 1930s–50s, considered the golden age of American comics. Catering to the heterosexual fantasies of male readers, Bill Ward’s art which includes erotic illustrations, pin-ups, and drawing covers for numerous magazines, appeared in adult magazines Screw, Leg Show, and Juggs. Throughout his career, he also worked on renewed characters like Judge Dread, Captain Marvel Jr, and The Marvel Family.   William Hess Ward was born in 1919 in Brooklyn but grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey, where over summer, he earned money by making illustrations on the back of denim jackets. The business turned out to be quite profitable as he sold several hundred pieces for a price of one dollar. The artist enrolled in the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. However, he did not take full advantage of such a prestigious institution, preferring more to have fun and socialize. In his own words, when he graduated in 1941, he was not a good illustrator.Ward’s first job with a Manhattan art service was not what he imagined, as he was supposed to clean after other artists. The job where he learned the most was working for Jack Binder, who he credited for teaching him all the fundamental skills. He began by doing backgrounds for such titles as The Shadow, Mr. Scarlet, Ibis, and Bullet Man. Bill Ward’s art gained prominence with the birth of the scantily dressed comic book character Torchy. While serving in the army during World War II, the artist found himself with a lot of free time, which he spent drawing. Some of his work was noticed by a fellow soldier who invited him to a strip for the base paper to boost the morale of the troops. The strip he created was entitled Ack-Ack Amy, which was the basis of the character Torchy. After the war, Ward returned to Modern Comics and began working on Blackhawk, which he considered the most challenging job he had ever had. One of the reasons was he and fellow artist Reed Crandall were not allowed to ink their work, which greatly bothered them. In 1946, when asked by Modern Comics if he had any idea for a new story, Ward suggested the bombshell babe Torchy which turned out to be a massive hit with the readers. Over the years, Bill Ward’s art became more erotic and sometimes even pornographic. He began working for several underground comics, such as Weird Smut Comics (1985), written by Dave Goode. His erotic stories appeared in adult softcore and hardcore pornography magazines, and William Hamling published several porn books with Ward’s illustrations. Bill Ward passed away in 1998 in New Jersey. ",2480

Alice Suret-Canale,"Alice Suret-Canale is a French contemporary painter based in Paris. She received her MA in Ancient Greek and went on to receive a Ph.D. in digital art in 2018. Since then, she has been fully dedicated to painting. Whatever the format, tiny or large, she considers the painting as a matrix. The frame serves as a physical border, compressing and giving shape to the patterns that inhabit it. Suret-Canale works within those limits, constructing a singular and alternative reality – a figurative one – relieved from our usual rules of space and time. From January 2019 onward, she has been working to clarify and decline this pictorial principle in the “Compressions” series. The paintings from the series, varying in size from several centimeters to more than 2 meters, focus on the figure, the body, and its relationship to intimacy. With the underlying subject being the gestation, the artist depicts maternal gestation – pregnancy and the inevitable changes it generates both in the mother’s body and in the intimacy of the couple, linking it to pictorial gestation, movements, and transformations of the painted space, patterns, and figures.     After earning her Master's degree, Suret-Canale became interested in animation, a field that offered her additional possibility for exploration, by adding the time constraint of the loop to the spatial constraint of the frame itself. In her own words: “The embryonic and fetal figures of my Compressions inherit therefore from the naive and schoolboy spirit of the digital culture of GIF but also from the romantic spirit of figurative constructions in modern painting…” So far, she has co-directed five short films awarded in several international festivals. To create these serious animated short films, Suret-Canale collaborates with several other artists, including Nicolas Liautaud, Hugo Paquin, Nicolas Dubois. They founded La Mécanique du Plastique on January 17, 2011, at noon, a collective focused on short animated films. Featured image: Alice Suret-Canale – portrait. Photo courtesy Gallarty",2533
Tatiana Nega,"Drawing since early childhood, Tatiana Nega is a Russian contemporary painter whose path to the art was not direct. She graduated from the Civil Engineering Faculty and worked as an engineer for some time, always feeling that something was missing from her life. Having realized that engineering is not her true calling, she enrolled at the Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named Ilya Repin (History and Theory of Art Department), graduating in 1989. Nega began writing art criticism articles, plunged deeper into the world of contemporary art – but the desire to paint herself didn’t leave her, pursuing her even more in her dreams. Desiring to express the interaction between chaotic and rational beginnings, which control our life, she understood we often can’t express our feelings freely and unleash spontaneous impulses due to boundaries, set by society or by our mind. “The only way to discover new opportunities is by breaking those rules. This is how I became an artist.” She invented new tools, new ways of painting. Through experimentation with shapes and mediums, she created her visual language, which reflects the swiftness of the changes in the modern world. “This language allows me to convey the dynamics and energy of life, its rhythm, variability, and inconsistency.” Nega held eight solo exhibitions between 2014 and 2019, the last of which, titled “Movement to shape,” was organized at Direct Art Action UK in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, in 2019. Her works are included in numerous private collections around the world, in countries such as France, Australia, Russia, Japan, Portugal, and the United States.
