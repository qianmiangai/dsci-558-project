artist who considers narrative as the main idea in her work. Line and the gesture
also play an important role. She enjoys working in series, ""driven by a desire

Janeiro, Silvana Soriano currently lives and works in Miami."
2,"John Van Alstine is an American
contemporary artist known for his sculptures made of stone and metal, usually
granite or slate, and found object steel. He uses stone as an assemblage
element (the way a welder uses steel) rather than in the traditional manner of
subtraction. In contrast to the stone and its timelessness, the found-object
metal (sometimes cast bronze) is time-specific - 20th century industrial. John
Van Alstine studied at St. Lawrence University, Kent State University (BFA in
1974), and at Cornell University (MFA in 1976). He worked as an assistant
professor of fine arts at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and the
University of Maryland in College Park, where he taught drawing and sculpture
until 1986 when he moved to the NYC area to pursue studio work full time."

The journey lasted a year and upon his return his unique visual diary, featuring revealing images of a previously inaccessible Tibet, was published to wide international acclaim."
